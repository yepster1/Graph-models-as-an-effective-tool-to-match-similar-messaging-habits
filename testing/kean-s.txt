 I'm meeting with Jerry Patterson today.  He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.  Jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that Ken has made a personal contribution.  Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.  Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution? 
 Good update.  Please put me on the distribution list for future installments. What about the net benefits test?  Will the rate agreement suffice?  call to discuss. 
 I've talked to McConnell, Shankman and Reck and gave them my OK. 
 I think this would be awkward given the large number of Business units

 Why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses.  We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.  We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.

 We are setting up a process to respond directly to these and other comments, questions and concerns.  Our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations. 
 In my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.  Please review and approve John's.  Please check on mine:  they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.  It may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once. 
 We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power.  I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

 What do you know about this guy? 
 I like your revised version.  I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think? 
 I like the first opening paragraph better.  Also, please don't use the term "corporate relations".  I think "community relations" works fine and won't create as much confusion with public relations, corporate communications or other functions.  thanks 
 I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.  Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we'll put it in front of derrick. 
 she might ... might... be a fit in Billy Lemmons group. 
 Thanks for your message.  We met about the fire drill process yesterday and will have something shortly.  One of the issues we are facing is the absence of "floor wardens" -- people who know the procedure and can help it move smoothly if there is a problem.  If you are willing to volunteer, contact mike terraso.  thanks

 Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind. (Enron Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension. 
 Here is the most recent update I have.  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing. The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).  Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.  Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe. 
 Absolutely ... Im sorry I saw this so late... we could have talked today.  Let's talk Mon

 Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):  Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood A "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.  Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.

  Please look into this 
 Redraft (confirm):  Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.  Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

 Please look into this and give Shelley a call back 
 We can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else, but the money to Brown is out the door. I would still like to see the data. 
 Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know.

 I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone. 
 Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.

 Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b= ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to cr= eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag= ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg= relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi= ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter= connections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create= an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open = transmission system. 
 I couldn't open link.  I s this something new for me to sign or have I already complied? 
 Attached is the final letter.  Please note - there was a small change at the top of page 2. 
 I think this is an excellent letter.  I agree with Sue's comments and have included her changes on Page 3.  All changes have been marked in this version. 
 Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business.  Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings outlook,"  said Skilling. 
 My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading. 
  fyi 
 As discussed. 
 I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media. 
 I love you.  Call me. 
 The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an= d then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why t= hat makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most= efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competit= ive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic reg= ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the = business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relie= d upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distrib= ution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set p= ricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a = great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for = lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c= ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policie= s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  = The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relativ= ely low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of= the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect t= o rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any = more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "re= tailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Com= petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a= nd terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of = service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign= contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the = legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading= in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be = perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents h= ave a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's clai= m of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer= cise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel= is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific = reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxerc= ise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we co= uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a = claim under such circumstances. 
 Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?  If so, please handle; otherwise let me know.

Each mile that electrici= ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20 "No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said= Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e= nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20 Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was = no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont= rols are in effect.=20 "This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no= t having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20 BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when = power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab= out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20 "Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, = a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee= s the state's power network.=20 The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after= Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting= heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li= ghts.=20 Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha= t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th= ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had= in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20 "We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti= al for unintended consequences."=20 Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less= - efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin= g, under capped prices.=20 "We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20 The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9= 2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because= of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20 Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha= ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20 "California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.= =20 'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20 California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t= hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal= regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit= hhold output.=20 "The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"= said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20 Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue= that they took up only with the greatest reluctance.

The department buys electricity fo= r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20 "They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio= n over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."= =20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca= lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll= ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20 Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia= ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark= et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p= rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A= nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap = will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20 "That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell= , editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind= of certainty at all."=20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import= s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark= ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s= tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou= ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr= ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p= lant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Indepen= dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When = there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ= ished during the latest alert.=20 Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i= n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte= rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent= of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif= ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h= ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20 The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $= 98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent = premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred= it risk in selling to the state.=20 O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t= ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20 In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu= t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou= t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20  The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co= m .=20      Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20 Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s= ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20  By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20  SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev= eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af= ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said. The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su= pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif= ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat= e's electricity since January. At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us t= hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going= to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said. The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s= ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m= eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since = May 31. Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte= nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e= mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli= es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th= e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price = is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare= ntly drove away sellers, Hart said. Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h= ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate. Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare = a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi= ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh= en it should take effect. They got no answer. Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar= ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s= uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency. Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i= t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri= ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la= tely. Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators = had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in = part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr= eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea= ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this = summer. "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said= .=20  Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20

 I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc). 
 I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU.  Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today. 
 Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings?

 Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who. 
 You may want to forward this to your customers. 
 Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue. Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!

 Steve will be in a Managing Director PRC that day - not sure if he will be out in time for a 5:30 event.  Maureen 
 I get in too late tonight, but maybe dinner or drinks on Thurs?

 This is Steve Kean's PAB 
 Here is the slide presentation we were talking about this morning. 
 No change.  The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.  We need to discuss the communication of the changes.  My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.  Is that right?  Is it all employees or only US based? 
 I have a question related to your former responsibilities:  As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).  With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.  What do you think? 
 Call at 5:00 today (3:00 your time), if you can. 
 The attachment was scrambled.  Can you send in word format? 
 Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.  Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk. 
 I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I'm not making the case for a different "tilt" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.  Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.  Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send. 
  Looks fine to me, but I would change the second sentence to refer to the "council" meeting twice per year (as opposed to "committee") 
 Looks good to me (I would not invite Glynn to dinner the night before, though). 
  Please forward to Ralph Reed 
  Jerry was one of the people from Mercatus conducting a seminar on financial and physical markets for FERC staff 
 I don't have a role for Tom at this time, but I appreciate the interest. 
  Looks fine to me 
 Ken had suggested that we try to get Schmalensee (sp?) for the October meeting as a substitute for Joskow.  What do you think? 
 My God ... this will be a lot of work.  How much of this can be pushed to the supervisors? 
 per my voicemail 
 I made some modifications, but we may want to make more ... I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer.  The audience should be redefined as the Senators, not just the members of the committee.  Let's discuss. 
 Thanks for your interest.  We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message. 
 JoAnn Hill is on vacation; I'll look into it. 
 Ken -- the process description (i.e. where Brown could play a key role) is discussed in the middle of the update document. 
 Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.  He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.  Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week:  Listing of who is owed how much in California Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions. Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.  The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this. 
 See attached. 
 Attached are the drafts as of Sunday: 
  Let Maggie know. I love you. 
 I think you do need to be there. 
 Revised documents (reflecting less definitive statements on earnings) 
 revised with kll comments (still need to include all employee memo). 
 Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.  Some of her work was presented by her colleague and Enron Advisory Council member -- Pankaj Ghemewat. 
 I'd like a copy of this. 
 I wrote some comments last night.  Maureen will fax this am.  As you will see, I have some deep concerns about the story -- content and the prudence of doing such a story. 
 including all employee memo 
 Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:  The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000). Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year. Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL). Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data. 
 draft of Ken's remarks. 
 test 
 Let's send it out. 
 See below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him. 
 I left a message.  Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys. 
 =09Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its mana= gement in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.  I have re= frained from responding until now.  Below (and in the attached in Word form= at) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can = call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).  Thank you for you= r consideration.  Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp.   It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (= "Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str= ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  = He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and= the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer= ely to entertain.  =09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f= ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy= the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl= y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make= choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i= ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically= , the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity= market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a= ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t= he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange= les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand= ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar= kets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are = doomed to repeat such mistakes.  Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp.  =20 
 I got fed up with Krugman . . . sent this out this am. 
 OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons, or does he already have it?  I think #90 might be at the heart of the matter.  If we kept the class size= smaller, we could be more selective, pay more for the higher quality talen= t, make more meaningful assignments, and provide for a more active mentorin= g and development program. 
 We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.  Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato 
 I received an auto-reply email from Terry Tang indicating that she is on va= cation and that I should forward this to you.  In the meantime,  I have spo= ken to Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO.  He said that he would be = happy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for p= ublication.  Let me know. 
 This is great. Rick, Jim and Elizabeth, we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization. 
 David, please forward to the appropriate person. 
 Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings. 
  Thanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.  Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with Jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by Ken's obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here. 
 See attached.  Christie -- please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones.  Maureen -- please put on my letterhead. 
 thanks 
 I haven't forgotten.  I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days. 
 I see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.  Alot of my people are outside of Houston.  Are they solicited anyway?  When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my Houston-based and outside Houston numbers. 
 Thanks, Rob.  I was "writing angry" so I wasn't sure how it would come off.= I did have my wife take a look and she assures me I didn't go "overboard"= . 
 At the end of this string is a letter reply to Mr. Krugman's most recent co= lumn.  As indicated below, Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO, would = be happy to put his name to the letter.  That would be our preference.  Let= me know if you need anything more.

 fyi 
 Thanks for the list.  One clarification:  What do you mean by the sentence starting "How challenged are we really . . ." 
 Well, I guess when you lose 80% of your ad revenue you get a little sensitive. . .   I wouldn't say I berated him; it was more like merciless hassling. 
  See me about this. 
 no message was attached 
  Many quotes from KP -- the Eastern Power Markets Oracle.  On balance a good article.  Thanks for helping out. 
 I believe we have this already.  John B could you send a copy to John S. 
  I think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes. 
 ? 
  Look at the topic below.  Should we send somebody? 
 We are responding.  I'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who's burning out? 
 Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.  Some further questions:    Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?  If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?  My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it? 
 I talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.  I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.  He said he would be interested.  If you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number. 
 Do we have a time for me to meet with Gil yet? 
 Please coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I'd like her to be at meeting. 
 I know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told Bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob's resume along. 
 Please put a confidential backgrounder re Rod Wright for Lay and I.  I'll be joining he and Ken for at least part of the discussion. Don't know/ havent heard anything re LOng Beach 
 Meeting not unitl 9/24 
 Please discuss with Vince.  I don't know how to engage relative importance 
 Jeff's number is 713.621.8620.  He has left for a whitewater rafting trip and won't be back for a couple of weeks I think. 
 Ask IR 
 I think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now.  But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.  We should be positioned for a great period of growth. 
 fyi 
 Honey, would you post this in the chatrooms? 
 I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.  A couple of requests:  Could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting? We are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.  Call when you get a chance. 713.853.1586.  Thanks. 
 this is what I was talking about this morning 
  recurring item for calendar 
  Hold on.  Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it's worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make. 
 I think we should have a version which says that "ken Lay named ... "  I don't know that the Board actually does the electing, I think Ken may just be making sure that they are OK with his decision.  I will confirm. 
 We still do and you should go if you can.  The next one is in London in October.  Joannie will be handling the logistics.  I am asking Maureen to send you the dates. 
 Do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with Gov. Geringer.  Also, I would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in Wyoming. 
 fyi 
 Bill -- fyi.  I don't want you to take any action on this until we have talked (i.e. please don't forward this or talk to the people involved yet).  Let's talk when you have a minute. 
 Please process the following effective July 1:  David Oxley and Mary Joyce base pay increase to 250,000. (Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley's situation with the EWS O of C.). Mark Palmer (PR) to 225,000. (Note:  I previously asked Mary Joyce to review Mark's position and this is the amount we agreed on).  I would also like to review Shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities. 
  I'll do lunch with Sue 
  Letter looks good to me. 
  I've been thinking about this.  Due to limited battery life, calling areas etc, I'm not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go.  I'm thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into. 
 Please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals 
 OK 
 ok 
 I need the following changes to Outlook:  I need my file folders to be "active" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline. I need my "inbox" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don't want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.  I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline. 
 Let's discuss.  I think we should emphasize, at the outset, our proposed solution. 
 Amy Kim is still an open question. I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy? I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount. I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past). 
 I've been thinking about the need to recast the "e-commerce" position as well.  I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks. 
 This is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk:  effective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.  If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals:  Steve Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550)  John Brindle Senior Director, Business Controls (3-3843)  John Presley Business Controls  Please deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect. 
 What do we think it means for the pace of reform?  Is it a mandate? 
 This is still confusing to me.  I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached). 
 fyi 
 See attached 
 Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson?

 I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense. 
 I don't want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the O of C. 
 I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for.  I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.  Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results. 
 I want to personally thank each of you for your work following last weeks tragic events.  It was deeply gratifying to see so many motivated, calm, and competent people assemble, organize and get the job done.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep competitive intelligence flowing to our business units and management, and make good and timely judgements on issues as they arose.  I hope your friends and family are well.  If any of you have former colleagues, friends or family who were affected by the tragedies you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.  Again, my thanks. 
 Let's just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments.  Thanks 
 I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.  I'm OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.  we may not get much response now.  We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference. 
 Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing 
  fyi 
  As we discussed 
  I have forwarded this to Fitch.  You should compare with your list and consolidate (or have Gary consolidate) onto one. 
 I talked to Ken yesterday and he is fine with this.

 This is fully consistent with what we are communicating throughout the organization 
 We are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc.  Terrie James is working with Ken on speakers.  It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today. 
 Thanks for the inquiry.  We do not have an interest in sponsorship. 
 I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).  In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today." 
 congratulations ... sorry to see you go. 
 please print attachements also 
 I concur 
  I know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.  I agree with John.  There is little point showing this to Ken ... but you personally know him better, so I leave it to you. 
 Please make sure these individuals know that they have been designated. 
 See below and look at attachment.  In a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity. 
 Here is a suggested Lay quote for the special committee release:  "With the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital, which we are also announcing today, we are taking care of the past and securing the future." 
 Thanks, Jeff.  We have already retained a crisis PR firm --Kekst and Co.  They have been working with us for the past few weeks.  Feel free to mention them to Chase. 
 Nice. 
  Fine as written. 
 Shankman told me tonight that the additional piece that makes up the difference between the 3.2 and the 4.4 has not been irreversibly committed to, so we don't have to pay. 
  Thursday is fine.  Please schedule. 
  Thursday is fine.  Let's talk about the proposed expenditures.  We will need to prioritize. 
 Thanks so much.  As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.  I will be in touch when the time comes. 
  It's going to be postponed til Feb.  I think you should attend when we have it. thanks 
 Please see revisions. 
 Jordan Mintz told me that the release needs to be reviewed one more time by securities lawyers.  He will take care of it. 
 here it is 
 David would  you please forward to the right person. 
 Looks good.  In the memo I wouldn't have ken refer to Dean Powers as "Bill"  sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing. 
 This is the final version agreed to by Citi and Chase. 
 I think we should shoot for Tuesday (after the written info is released Mon).  I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.  Here's what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday's written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.  I also think it needs to be a call not a webcast.  What do you think? 
 Would be happy to.  Just let me know where. 
  fyi 
  fyi 
 The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.  Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the plan, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios. 
 I don't think so. 
 Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft. Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it. 
 Some good news.  Your call to Gov Rowland was helpful.  We are not finished yet, but we are on our way. 
 Thanks for thinking of us.  We have retained a crisis communications firm  -- Kekst &CO. -- to assist us.  They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken.

 If you'd like, I can set up a tour of the Enron Center for you and anyone else you'd like to include. 
  I agree with Beth.  We had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage, but the Dynegy option was the best.  It's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down. 
 This msg is about new bldg tour -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Anything further yet? 
 Irwin is on Enron's advisory council.  Could one of you send him a reply? 
  fyi 
 Linda was assistant secy of US Treasury while this legislation was being negotiated.  Let us know if we can help. 
 Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:  Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around. Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances. If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could: Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition. Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief. (You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.) We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service. EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession. We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms. Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal. 
 Ken talked with Barton.  Barton will not be signing the letter The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill. Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will). I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter). 
 Thanks for the message.  I don't know of anything moving forward as yet. 
 I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing. 
  Could you take a look at this? 
 Thanks for the invite.  We will probably still be on our way back from New Mexico (we're driving), so we won't be able to come.  Have a good time ... I know you will. 
 I hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.  I understand that Ken and Chuck have spoken and that Greg, Stan, and Dave will be coming over at 3:00 and no one is expected to be there at 1:00.  Correct?

 I'm sorry ... I told mom, Phil and Karen, but not you... Francis died two weeks ago.  Norma is fine.  She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas). 
 Thanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill.  Am I missing something?  Do I have Enron stock I can sell to offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas? 
 Michelle - can you respond?  I haven't seen anything.  Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution. 
 Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow. 
 Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my Enron."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best. 
 I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.  Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one. 
 As discussed. 
  Please prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature.  Please get me his phone number and get his fax number, so we can fax as well as mail the letter. 
  I am terminating McLarty today.  We can't terminate with Kissinger yet.  I = think we also need to terminate our agreement with Sue Walden.  Do you have= the agreement? 
  If you are checking e-mail, show this to Nora. 
 Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.  Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Attached is the draft release.  I didn't mean to come across too pessimistic on the way in this am.  The release does contain good news and we need toget it out as soon as we can. 
    This is an article that Irwin Stelzer wrote abut Enron.  He is willing to talk further.  His number is 202.777.3000.  He said he would like to have me on the phone when you call. 
 You should read this.  You won't like some of the comparisons, but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished. 
  What do you think? 
 thanks 
 OK with you? 
 Rick -- I'm so sorry to hear about this, but I'm glad the outlook is good.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 
 Thank you.  I look forward to seeing you again in the interview process. 
 I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go. 
 FYI and please handle. 
 please schedule 
 I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.   There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.  I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.  Again, my thanks. 
 I think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.  More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything. 
 Here is the electronic copy. 
 This relates to the EPA region 9 issue we discussed last week 
 Has Koenig seen the IR section?  I don't agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors.  I can't believe he would think that's accurate. 
  Rick -- per my voicemail 
 I don't think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed.  I don't think they will and I think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take.  Also, I want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don't slow down the "badge in" process.  The other recommendations look fine to me.  I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval. 
 Thanks for the update.  Your approach makes sense to me. 
 FYI 
 As we discussed 
 Please see attached revised travel advisory.  I think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests. 
 No word yet. I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow.  FYI,  I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin. 
  Per my voicemail.  I'll be seeing Barton today in Austin and will make these points as well. 
 I wrote a letter of recommendation for you (you're getting it whether you want it or not).

 I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday.  The message they are stressing is that FERC is injecting much needed certainty.  I think we should add that to our message as well.

 thanks so much for the note.  I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.  My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.  I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I'll be glad when this one is over). 
 Thanks 
 I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).  The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).  Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work. 
 Please print. 
 Thank you.  I also enjoyed our discussion very much.  Your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive.  You will be getting a call shortly, if you haven't already, inviting you to our weekend event later this month.  Please come. 
 I believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?

 These are good fixes.  I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly. 
 Sherrie and Rosie:  Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about designating portions of their contributions for use  in Texas.  Mr. DeLay would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint letter).  It is, of course, up to Ken and Jeff whether to make the designation.

 What do you think? 
 I think you, or someone in your group, should cover this.  The attendees are operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting, interconnection and environmental issues.  Also, from a more macro perspective, what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on operators  -- the importance of flexibility in asset operations (ie the premium the market will place on quick response) or the challenges of different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets. 
 Maybe we should knock down the walls of those cavernous offices on the top= =20 floor.

 JUST A REMINDER:  The answer to the United Way Pre-qualifying Questionnaire need to be turned in by the end of tomorrow, July 26, 2000.  To find the questionnaire form to submit - see the email sent from the United Way Campaign 2000, dated 7/19/00.  I encourage you all to participate.  Thanks. 
 Enron has begun its executive solicitation for United Way.  You should have received an email providing the intranet address where you can pledge online. (Please note:  when entering the information online - enter 4 digits for your birth year).  I encourage you to be the leaders in giving for Governmental Affairs/Public Relations and make your pledge this week.  Further, please invite the generous participation of the people in your groups.  Thank you for your involvement. 
 I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend some time with them. 
 I'd like to get about 30 minutes with Mark, just to catch up. 
 ditto -- nice work Rob.  Your insights on project stanley are also much appreciated.

 See below.  this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps, because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west.  In addition, if you get questions from the analysts on "reregulation" or price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services . . .  even a $250 price cap is 5-10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying. 
 See below.   This would have presented a bigger problem than price caps. 
 Any problem? please advise Don. 
 Tim -- Cindy manages this program. Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on this. Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism). 
 I think this is a good idea.  We may want to think about CNBC as well. Brandon -- any technical obstacles? Margaret/Cindy -- how does the link work?  does it go straight to the clip or do users have to navigate within CNN's site? 
 Are you aware of this?

 Humberto - I forwarded your resume to Barry Hunsaker who is general counsel at EOG Resources.  As you may know, EOG used to be Enron Oil and Gas, a majority-owned Enron subsidiary.  A couple of years ago, Enron sold its interest in EOG and it became a stand alone company.  EOG Resources has been doing very well.  I don't know if they are looking for lawyers now, but I think I sent your resume to the right place. 
 Maureen - please forward on to Barry when you get his e-mail address.  Barry - I don't know Humberto personally, but looking over his resume, I thought he might be a fit in your organization. 
 I think it starts off a bit too hot.  I would pull up some of the arguments you make about the need for additional supply and the importance of electricity to our way of life.  I'd then go into a discussion of the debacle in the West (and how they are now playing catchup - with loud, polluting diesel generators ... as was reported today).  Then I'd go into how our plants in Florida represent a very reasonable, inobtrusive solution for Florida. 
 Congratulations!

 Fax the attached word document to Jeff ASAP, thanks. 
 I'll be happy to accomodate.  I can take you through Enron's view of how markets overall are evolving and how we approach those markets.  I'd also like to spend some time reviewing interstate transmission policy and how it affects Western energy markets. 
 Could you please put together a combined presentation : Enron's strategy and the need for open access on the transmission system? 
 fyi 
 Thanks.  We are preparing a memo (John has seen it) to go out to each of our offices telling them about this incident (and the related ones that occurred the same day) and including some tips on how to handle such confrontations in the future. 
 thanks

 Is Jeff available? 
 Looks good to me.  I'm glad you had the chance to work with Linda. 
 This looks like a run-of-the-mill conference except that the guest list is fairly senior.  Any interest? If not, let Amy know. 
 Please send any comments directly to Peggy. 
 I just spoke with Clark Smith, head of Elpaso's merchant arm.  I told him that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in Western gas markets.  He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was spreading the rumor (I told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources).  He acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it had been identified as such; and said he would bring it up on his call with his Washington team this afternoon.  I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been done).  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El Paso pointed to us.  Can anybody give some info on that?

 Is there anything we can tell them about the rates they should expect from the utility?  I think that will be the biggest concern and we can reduce backlash if we can provide them some information. 
 I think we need to keep the pressure on.  I liked the way our basic message= =20 was evolving over the course of last week.  As you pointed out, the Japanes= e=20 utilities view us as just another annoying US company who is going to come= =20 in, bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave.  We nee= d=20 to continue to reinforce the message that not only are we not going away, w= e=20 are starting other businesses here to keep us going while we continue to=20 agitate for reform in the electricity sector. 
 This is a thorough and helpful analysis.  But, have we considered the broader emergency powers the president might have (i.e. beyond the clean air act waivers requested by a governor)?  It would seem that the importance of the defense business in California, the large number of military facilities, the public safety hazards of widespread blackouts, etc. ought to trigger some broader authority. 
 What do you make of this? 
 I'll do it.  I saw Steve Reynolds (the govs assistant), today, and told him I would do it.  I have a lot of respect for Geringer.  I may try to persuade them that they should reach out to FERC and Congress as a state that sees the need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages FERC to act.  Any background you have would be most appreciated. 
 Hello Sue:  What time would Steve need to be there and what time can he leave?  I need to start thinking about flights.  Thanks !! 
 Dear Christine:  Unfortunately, Steve has been out of the country call week.  He will return to the office tomorrow.  Let me get back with you early tomorrow regarding the presentation.  If you need to contact me, please call me at 713-853-1808.  Maureen McVicker Executive Assistants 
 I'd prefer to skip.  How big of a problem would that be? 
 Thanks.  Yes, I did know about the conference.  Ken has a copy of the study and made reference to it several times during our visits to Sac. a couple of weeks ago.  It's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in California. I look forward to catching up with you when I get back to town. 
 I won't be going.  Let's look for an alternate.  I'd be happy to come to DC. 
 Yes, please. 
 Please set up some time with Linda.

 Steve Kean, of Enron, will be attending on May 22nd. 
 fyi -- further distribute this message as you see fit. 
 I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization. 
 Regarding the Brand Conference in San Francisco Aug. 13 -15,  here is the flight information for Steve Kean and his wife, Melissa.

 Joe is working with the Governor's office and so should go on that list, not the sellers list. 
 One minor point:  the response to the first data request implies that all employees went through the PRC process in 2000.  I am not sure this is accurate.  It's fair to say that most did, but I believe that the field employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through the PRC process. 
 Linda - I haven't heard of these guys.  Do you know them?

Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.  Best, Jeff  SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.  The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________  Attached are the contact lists.

 Sorry for the delay.  I have asked the question and should have an answer in a day or two. . . .  don't do anything rash in the meantime. 
 Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options. Specifically, they want to know what the exercise policy is on i) termination eg as a result of the prc process, ii) voluntary departure, iii) retirement, or iv)resignation; and to what extent do the rules vary across plans: i) AESOP, LTIP, deferred bonus etc.  The main focus is on the length of time to exercise.  I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the structure -- eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than employees who just leave voluntarily ( ie if you want to have a full three years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company? 
 ok 
 Thanks for the update.

 Sorry, I got overwhelmed by California.  I have not talked to Ken yet and will be in Japan until Friday.  Perhaps we can hook up then? 
 Thanks for the explanation.  I agree, though I may not have explained the context adequately to Ken. 
 include on the distribution list and send out note about the Monday meeting. 
 There were several items in the mail pouch that you needed a response form me on.  Here are the responses:  Marchris forwarded a request to attend a conference on Aug 19 and 20.  I think the original invite when to Ken and Jeff.  I will attend, subject to them getting some reasonable response rate from the commissioners they invited and provided that I get a speaking or similar participation opportunity.

 Portland General called.  They have heard that Defazio is going to propose in a press release that the state of Oregon should buy PGE. 
 Jon -- Ricardo Charvel is pulling together the briefing for Ken, so please share the EBS activities/ agenda with him.  Thanks 
 I'd be happy to call Nickles. 
 Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.  Three expressed willingness to help.  Scott McNealy (Sun):  contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.  Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a "cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of suggested contacts. Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.  Sharer wants the same information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to call a meeting of other California CEOs.  Sharer will also be having breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today. Robert Day (Trust Co of the West):  said that he is very close to the mayor of Los Angeles.  He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).  Ken would like some talking points for that call.  Jeff - please put these items together. 
 prepare for my siganture.  cc Lisa 
 The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides: the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for utilities.  California's utilities were pushed to the brink of, or into, bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to them.  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are conducted in a marketplace.  Also, did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently? 
 I think the presentation looks fine, but consider adding this:  there is real risk to utilities (as well as customers) in continuing a regulated regime. The California utilities have been pushed into or to the brink of bankruptcy 
 Decline is ok.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Steve - take a look at this and contact the sponsor with a yes or no.  Thanks 
 fyi 
 Forward to whomever you see fit. It looks like an opportunity to explain price risk management to large customers. 
 please forward to Vicky Sharp.

 Steve wanted you to know that he will be attending the Gov. Davis meeting tomorrow with Greg Whalley.  Just in case you need it, here is Steve's bio. 
 Below is the information regarding the meetings in Sacramento on Wed., May 9  Please have Greg go to our lobbyist's offices for the pre-meeting located at:  Scott & Hedy Govenar Governmental Advocates 1127   11th Street Suite 400 Sacramento, CA  95814  916-448-8240  11:00 am  Pre-meeting w/ Greg Whalley, Steve Kean, Jeff Dasovich, Sandi McCubbin, possibly Richard Sanders,   possibly Michael Tribolet (via phone)  1:00 pm Mtg at Gov. Davis' office 
 I left Hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too.  I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines:  gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state. gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity. gas utilities fialed to fill storage. gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets. In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California, not outside. 
 Please get available dates.  I need to be there for this. 
 Thanks for the invite. I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas government/regulatory affairs team.  She is certainly more familiar with the details (of which there will be many more after this legislative session and the conclusion of the pilot program).  She is also a very good speaker (and can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up). 
 do we have a mechanism to survey employees?  Can we do a "scientific" poll? 
 I love you, baby.  Study hard. 
 Please add Linda Robertson (Head of our DC office) to this list if that's ok. 
 Minor changes shown on the attached (gotta get the big guy's title right). 
 I think the meeting is on Wednesday, but if you can be there (Sacremento, I expect) you should.  As I mentioned in my voicemail, I think the meeting will not be particularly substantive;  more likely it is a photo op for the governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators.  Based on your message below, should we still plan to send somebody?  I still think we should if we can manage the legal risk.  Mike:  would you be able to attend as well? 
 I think we should let people in the legislature know about this and see if one or more of them can get their hands on it. 
 OK by me. 
 OK by me. 
 Thanks for the invite (and the follow up voicemail).  I'd love to see the General (and you of course), but I'm going to have to pass.  Thanks anyway. 
 meeting file 
 as discussed 
 I think the memo needs some additional work.  I have made a number of suggestion (highlighted on the attached). 
 A memo is coming out shortly. 
 no objection 
 Looks fine to me.  I have not cross checked the lists, but I assume you have included everyone who was designated to serve on the PRCs per the original memo (in addition to the new bus unit additions) 
 We are concerned about leaks to the press which may have ocurred from our Washington office over the last few months (including leaks from a former employee).  Could you put someone in touch with Rick and Linda Robertson (head of our DC office)? 
 calendar - fyi

 This is an issue we have long struggled with.  We have conducted several comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be considered in the prioritization and resource allocation process.  I think the project is a good idea.  Your sources would be John, Jim Steffes, and Rick Shapiro (for the RCR, or resource commitment process). 
 more detailed information 
 looks good

 One minor edit 
 I have advised against Ken or Jeff attending the generators meeting:  Ken is still willing to make time avail on the 3d to meet with the gov. 
 fyi. 
 Could you coordinate with Cindy Stark on the meeting with Massey in a couple of weeks?  Stan has asked me if I would like to attend.  I would, but don't know when exactly it is scheduled for. 
 Nice work Kerry and Barb.  I think we should do the follow up work on setting a follow up meeting with the Senator.  Ken left it open whether he would be available when the Sen is in Houston, so we have made no commitment in that regard.    Janine Migden  04/27/2001 08:32 AM 
 Additional information on the regulatory context. 
 FYI. I think they should try to get in to see Lundquist, but I don't think we need to participate in this.  We have been focussed on nation-wide issues when we have had the opportunity to meet with Lundquist and I don't think we should use our limited shots here. 
 I forgot to email myself the brief to track changes, but here are my changes in writing:  p. 1:  Para starting "focusing on the latter," that sentence, change "get creative" to be innavotaive in its approach."  p. 2:  1st full Paragraph, Second sentence, change "uniting" to "common" and there is a typo on line5, reduction n consumption.   Should be "of"  page 6:  We need the RR for PG&E.  Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal, unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period.  We told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times in the brief.  We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices, as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed.  page 8:  2.  Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete "between" in first sentence.  page 9:  Second full paragraph, begining "Again, the UDS's, "  Second sentence, sited should be "cited"  p. 12:  First full paragraph beginning "A primary component,"  Insert a sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak.  Second full parag, beginning, "Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about arbitrariness in there too.  And change "more necessary goal" in 4th sentence to "more critical goal"  I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott, so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to.  I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the 9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).  But I will communicate with Harry and everyone else before then.  Thanks. 
 Please coordinate with PGE on the comments. 
 Congratulations on your appointment by Fox.  That's great news.  I continue to be impressed by the way Fox is handling things.  Let me know what I can do to help.  As you know we are looking for a replacement for the unreplaceable Ricardo Charvel.  I know you and he have discussed some possibilities.  Rick Shapiro has met several candidates and will be bringing two to Houston in the next week or so.  Dr. Kean continues to improve her golf game while I slave away at Enron to cover the greens fees.  Let me know when you are coming to town next. 
 Have we made this available to the Cheney team? 
 Go ahead. 
 I think it's a good idea, but we will need a different summary ... either limit the summary to a couple of key points or provide an explanation, in layman's terms, of the practical effect of each of the changes. 
 I think wholesale will be well covered.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Ken talked to Sen Kinder.  He made the points you had prepared.  Kinder agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.  He said he had been hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help competition develop in the state.  He expressed willingness to work with us on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's offices.  He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come to Houston around that time. 
 OPIC information 
 fyi 
 We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.  We need to get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.  Shelley -- could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.  Should Joe or I (or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week? 
 I already responded to this.  Print for my meeting file. 
 I will need an LCD projector and a computer (or connections for my computer) so that I can show the presentation.  Thanks.

 Cindy - this looks like it might be an opportunity for you or David to reach your target audience. 
 Suggested changes are highlighted below. 
 We can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is focussed on developing IT systems for bulk power systems:  We need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having IT solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work. The IT firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers (domestic and international)  whose decisions will make the IT firm's systems either successful or obsolete. Call me if you would like to discuss. 
 OPIC information. 
 Jean - please get in touch with Greg. 
 Yes 
 I'll give 150.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I think Mike should sign

 See natural gas price article below.  Our buddy Paul Carpenter has turned o= n=20 us (not to mention that he seems to be talking nonsense).  How about giving= =20 him a call? 
 I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is willing to work on other times, but suggested the following After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing to do this if necessary) His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early morning on the third. Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down? 
 I got a voicemail response from Jeff - he is fine with me substituting for him on the Japan trip. 
 Let's ask Jeff Hines(?), our opinion research guy, to put a few short questions together and send it out.  We may also want to include a link so people can view the commercials again before answering.  Also,  I was talking with Beth Tilney today about our website (and the fact that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing).  We thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference (perhaps as part of an existing segment). 
 I think Jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on this (and future air and climate change position inquiries).  Jeff - please make sure you get the comments of all involved.

 I would'nt have it introduced by the "corporate policy committee".  I would say Enron is introducing or "there is a new tool available to you".  I am anxious to see how this goes over; it's a great tool. 
 No charges.  I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest.  In this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in the finance group in London.  That way, we can make a better determination about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in pitching them on doing bus. with Enron can be involved. Or, we can make a determination to decline.  I think we decide who we want to let in then do it for free, rather than charging.   MARY CLARK @ ENRON 04/17/2001 08:58 AM

This ought to be something IT simply takes care of without us having to get involved or pay extra.  Am I missing something? 
 Interesting idea, but hard to see any near term benefit.  I would decline. 
 Thanks for the updated presentation.  It helps me a great deal to keep up with you guys.  Send more as you do them. 
 Thanks for handling.  Let me know if it begins to interfere unduly with your new responsibilities. 
 Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Note Tim's question about handicapping the liklihood of approval.  Prices will move in the West based on these odds.  We need to have a better view than anyone else. 
 You are awesome. 
 Thanks so much for your message.  Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate function to a "default provider" role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).  The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying "we're from corporate and we're here to help".  If you don't need any "help" or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me know. 
 Good brief.  I have noted a few comments and questions throughout the text. Ignore my universal change to the word "transmissions".

 Attached is the information on talent moves within Enron.  The numbers are for Enron's domestic workforce only.  The bottom line is that the EBS and EES redeployment figures are not unusual for Enron:  We moved over 3000 employees last year (about 25% of our domestic workforce).  Most of these moves are attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of business transfers within the company.  The formal redeployment process makes up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company. 
 yes, send to dennis 
 could you look into this for me? 
 Never mind ... I found 'em.

 I agree with Mark's changes and I think the memo is good to go. 
 Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:  Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

 Ken & Jeff,  We would like to extend an invitation to you for an event at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, honoring the Frank Gehry Exhibit which Enron is sponsoring.   Frank Gehry, a celebrated architect whose building appears at the end of our Ode to Why commercial, personifies innovation in the way he has "asked why," challenging nearly every convention in his field.  Enron will have a table of 10 at the Trustee Opening Gala Dinner on May 16th, with cocktails at 7pm and a seated dinner at 8:30pm.  The Gala starts with a private viewing of the exhibition, followed by a seated dinner for 280 people in the Rotunda of the museum. Attendees are comprised of Trustees, government dignitaries, artists, curators and celebrities.  Several business unit executives are using this forum to take potential customers and we would like to know if you are interested in attending. Please advise.  Thanks, Steve

 Melissa:  Steve has another trip to New York coming up.  He will fly up late afternoon on Thurs., April 19.  He speaks at a conference sometime in the morning on Friday, April 20.

 calendar. Also, I would like you to set up a meeting with me, Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney, Kelly Kimberly, Mark koenig, Rick Causey, and Rick Buy.  I was thinking the easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 6 or 6:30 some evening.  I have contacted Beth and Cindy already, so they know what it is about, and I will leave messages for the others.  I just need to check schedules for now.  Also,  I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once a month or so for the Public Affairs organization.  Nothing fancy . .  . Cadillac Bar or something similar. . .  spouses and significant others invited.  Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know what you come up with. 
 Thanks for the note.  I am forwarding it on to our analyst and associate recruiting program leaders.

 I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever.  Having duties related to setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on the Hill, will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those duties, not just those related specifically to her substantive area.  I think it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting, rather than directing, others in the organization.

 The conversation was very positive (Glynn did not know anything about it at first, but, looked into it and called Ken back Friday evening).  Glynn said they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts, including this one, as soon as they get paid.  He said that this weekk would be focussed on finalizing a deal for SCE given the threat of bankruptcy; the discussions would then turn to PG&E.

 As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea, the answer is somewhat mixed.  We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting.  Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases.  California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements.  In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases.  I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.      Mark Schroeder@ECT 03/11/2001 02:11 PM 
 I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations.  The order provides for $69 million in "potential" refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification).  Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, but PGE was ($3.18 million).  It's not over yet, though.  The order deals only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark prices through April 01.  The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000).  With respect to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard.  I'm copying Jeff Dasovich because I'm sure he has more up to date information.       Mark Schroeder@ECT 03/11/2001 02:11 PM

 It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.  I have talked with John several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.  As a result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the proposed budget for "01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort).  Having said that, my view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer issues associated with the asset sales.  Do you agree? 
 Please see attached.  Rob, perhaps while in London you could stop by Mark's desk to discuss. 
 How important is this fight to us now (see attached article on ExIm)? 
 I think this is a very interesting idea.  Please get with Bill D. and make sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go ahead.    Laura Schwartz 03/05/2001 12:52 PM

 Just received a voicemail from Stan.  He knows Mike; he does not have any spots for him right now.  My suspicion is that the EES discussions are not ultimately going to yield fruit.  We are probably going to have to discuss what's next. 
 Thanks for the update.  The Western Governors remain the best avenue we have for preventing price caps and California's attempts to secede from the grid.

It will be a casual day and wear green to support the CORP. game show participants.  I encourage you to click on the United Way web site to make a contribution. Everyone that makes a contribution by COB Friday will be eligible for the Governmental Affairs raffle for BIG PRIZES!!  While I encourage you to give generously, any amount is certainly helpful.  A weekly contribution of:  $1 provides 8 families with a week's work of food $2 helps teach 5 adults to read, breaking the cycle of illiteracy $5 provides 60 seniors with a nutritious meal and social interaction at a senior center  For example, last year UW in the Houston Gulf Coast area fed more than 1,000,000 seniors; helped 42,000 children attend quality childcare; and provided job training to 45,000 people.  Through United Way's volunteer allocation committees, projects are funded and reviewed to ensure accountability.  It is an effective way to give back to our community.  Thanks for your support. 
 As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation.  At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:  How great of a threat is re-regulation. How might we respond. How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?

 I agree with John's recommendations. We have been doing surprisingly well in the press.  And, for the most part, those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology ... we are not going to convert them. 
 Tony Pryor (GPG legal) asked if we have any credentials/tickets left for die hard democrats in the company.  I know Tony will understand if they are already spoken for, but if we have some left that would go unused, we have a volunteer.  How's it going?  Are you partied out yet? 
 fyi 
 Tom:  What address should I use for the Sen. Wyden letter?  Thanks. 
 Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, Joshua Sheinkman.  As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of financial information. The additional details they are looking for include: what information should be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the legislation. Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and forward to Linda. Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov. Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the legislation.

 I concur    John Ambler@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/12/2001 09:32 AM 
 The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.  We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially commodities or "commoditzable" goods).   Most recently we have extended into metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or both) of two perspectives:  business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well).  public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react? 
 what do you think? 
 I am sooooooooooooo proud of you.  More importantly, you should be proud of you.    Kean_Margaret <Margaret_Kean@Duchesne.org> 02/12/2001 10:00 AM

 We move alot of people around Enron.  In fact, on an annual basis, we make about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston, moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve later this year when we begin occupying the new building.    Erin Rice 02/13/2001 11:09 AM 
 I am attaching several items that I hope you will find useful when you brief Chambers:   A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful). This is an internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential (though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents). A basic outline of solutions. A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders. (It's another internal analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems and solutions than we have seen before.  As we discussed on the phone, our biggest problem is inertia ... we don't have much time, many solutions have long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.  Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura. 
 Leslie:  I checked with Steve and he would like you to revise it.  Thanks,  Maureen    Leslie Lawner 02/12/2001 11:36 AM

 Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a couple of months ago.    John Ambler@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/09/2001 05:35 PM 
 I am hoping we can prevail upon you two for your customary, if not always cheery, review of macroeconomic trends.  Please let me know. 
 fyi 
 Great presentation, as always.  I think you should add a brief set of talking points:  what are the key messages we want to convey? what, if anything, can we ask Martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run?  Maureen: please get this to Ricardo (he's at the EBS offsite this am). 
 I just read the E-Speak transcript.  I think you did a great job!  I look forward to sitting down with you after we have gathered all the feedback from the website and other sources.

 Nice work, Mike 
 I have sent a reminder.  The EES team has been working around the clock on California matters, so I'm not surprised that they haven't focusses o this yet    Mark Schroeder@ECT 01/31/2001 05:42 AM 
 Palmisano left a couple of months ago to start his own business.  Jeff Keeler (in our DC office) is covering John's issues. 
 I know you guys have been working around the clock.  I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten about Mike Dahlke (whose resume I sent on to you Dan).  When you catch a breath please take some time to consider Mike for EES.

 Karen Denne's title is VP, Communications.  You need to add: Dennis Vegas, VP Brand Management & Strategic Marketing  Thanks.  I'm not sure what Steve's presentation will be titled.  He's in Portland today.  Can I give you the title on Monday?       Kelly Johnson 02/01/2001 01:59 PM

 Sorry I didn't have much time to talk yesterday.  The presentation went well.  We had a great turnout and Celeste, Andrew Miles and John Walt (and the other Enron attendees) did a great job. I'm going to talk to Traci on Monday.    Kristin Gandy 01/29/2001 12:38 PM 
 fyi -- messages re California 
 There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro project.  The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it, but we are not going to.  Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are not pursuing the project.  Kelly will also be getting in touch with David Howe. I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting questions. 
 fyi  Also, you should contact Ken's assistant, Rosalee Fleming, to see when would be a good time to give ken a briefing and see what else he needs.  I have told Rosalee that you are preparing the materials for Ken. 
 Here are the documents. 
 what do you think? 
 meeting file 
 FYI -- Kalen is the head of HR for EES;  she works for Beth Tilney. 
 We need to put a briefing book together for Ken ASAP for his California trip. 
 Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.  There are a couple of follow-up items:  Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that could be sent to the FERC. Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get them to Linda? Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to "price gouge" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc. 
 I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.  He agreed: errors of commission are much better than errors of omission.  H e does want to be personally involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls next week to help get some confirmations.  Deal directly with him . . . there's no need for me to be in the middle.  Also, a bit of background: Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before, but they don't want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press present.  Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing.  I felt overprepared -- which is just how I want to feel -- and every bit of information I needed was at my fingertips.

 Joe:  Thanks again for coming to Houston this week.  CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of your proposal are worth exploring further.  However, we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive sponsorship.  I want to stress, though, that many of the elements of the package you and David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions with you.  Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here.  Thanks again. 
 Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:  Urged us to "stay at the table".  Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices).  QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity).  Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh.  If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply).  Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening.  Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?).  Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.  Thinks it's nearly a "done deal" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.  Says securitization may be harder to get.  Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.  Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow. 
 I tinkered a bit more with the background doc. 
 Nathan, give me  call if you can -- 713-853-1586.  I'm EVP and Chief of Staff for Enron.  We met during the on-campus interview process.  I know we have extended an offer and I'm still hoping you'll accept.  Call me.

 Call me about this 
 Attached is the presentation and speech notes that Ken Lay used on Wednesday at the Austin meeting with Bush, etc. 
 I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.  He is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience.  While I don't have a position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an open position.  My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.  I stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could build to it over time.  His main concern was that he not get "lost in the system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.  I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.    Kayla Ruiz 01/04/2001 09:08 AM

 OK to update    Sherri Sera 12/29/2000 09:51 AM 
 Scott sent this to Marty, but I assume you already have had communications with him about this. 
 Please respond and copy me. 
 Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management. I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.  Hang in there. 
 Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very well.  Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.  She is very well respected in washington.  She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.  She has gotten up to speed very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's already paid for!!). 
 Forgot to include you on this. 
 We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. 
 fyi 
 Rosie -- I'm not sure if this went through ... I couldn't find it in my "sent file".  Karen -- attached are the documents I mentioned to you a minute ago. 
 This is very good work.  You make all the points we need to make without spraining anything in the process.  You have been doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances.  On another note:  I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.  We are trying to get another time, perhaps as early as this week.  Davis did meet with Greenspan and Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively. 
 The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you helped put together.  Thanks 
 The plan was to hit the issue twice -- once in the short format of Ebiz and at greater length in the longer format of the October issue of Enron Business.  Please let Paul know. 
 Please see the revised memo, which is the final version. 
 As we discussed 
 Steve asked that I forward this revised version to you.   I have incorporated Michelle Cash's changes. 
 I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in California perhaps we should consider it.

 Question:  why do we need from jan 8 to jan 31 to respond to staff comments? I think we should squeeze that time dramatically to take a shot at Jan or early Feb resolution.  If there is slippage, I don't want our earliest target date to be the end of Feb.    Sarah Novosel 12/18/2000 05:27 PM

 Background information.  I'd like to talk to Ken about making the call. . . I'll see him at Exec comm today. 
 We'll have the usual macroeconomic update from Larry Lindsay and Gavyn Davies, the domestic political update from Bill Kristol and some presentations from Gary Hamel and others focussing on Enron NetWorks. 
 See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.  The message is: there has not been enough deregulation;  the government is still very much in the way.  California is a perfect example:  the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage. 
 As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use.  Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.  In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not deregulation.  When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market).  In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds.  The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.  Policy makers should:  Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed.  Expedite interconnection of new generation.  Expedite siting of new facilities.  Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions.   Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

 UPDATE:  AT THIS TIME, OUR GROUP PARTICIPATION IN UNITED WAY IS ONLY 50%   PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO FILL OUT YOUR UNITED WAY PLEDGE TODAY.   You can do so by clicking on the following link:  http://unitedway.enron.com 
 Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I think the second topic you mentioned "Escaping the Inherent Limits of Success" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and look forward to seeing you there. 
 I've made some changes (shown in bold).  Bracketed text indicates a deletion  . 
 In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at Enron.  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone). This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization 
 My message cut off...  The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. . solutions which have become available only recently.  Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization.  I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.   I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron. 
 Yes.  Contact either Gia or John and get the ball rolling.  Thanks 
 Should we (or ESCA) start looking for opportunities like this now to get the word out? 
 Please forward to public affairs group. 
 fyi 
 I don't really have a problem with this, but I thought that all VP promotions were supposed to go through our year end process.  That's what I have been saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.  Ken, being newly back in the fold, likely didn't know about the process. 
 fyi 
 We handed the Oped to DeLay's staff at lunch.  I think we're finished for now. 
 Any interest? 
 Not yet.  May not be until sept 5 as ken is on vacation.  but there is a chance that ken will try to reach him in the meantime.  I'll let you know when I hear. 
 the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson, Fleischman-Hillard, Divall, etc.  I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however, (and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly). 
 Eric - I think the release looks fine.  Shelley -- I take it there are no affiliate issues here (or they have been fully vetted)? 
 this is fantastic!! 
 FYI.  These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about. 
 Is this someone in the analyst/associate program? 
 You probably saw the announcement that Mike Mcconnell is now CEO of Enron Global Markets.  EGM will be focussing on a number of new and existing markets (including coal, LNG, crude and products, interest rates, agricultural commodities, equities, weather, etc).  One of the markets Mike's group is actively considering is transport capacity.  I mentioned your work in the area.  He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a chance to review it. 
 In case you had not heard, Lou Pai has done some fundraising for Franks and both he and his(Lou's) sister know him fairly well.  Keep it in mind if at some point we need to get in to see him. 
 I think the Qs and As look good. I wouldn't bring up the California situation (eliminate the second half of A25). 
 I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem -- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem. Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go out at all. 
 Have we suggested to FERC staff that they force the ISO and PX to open the "blackbox" to show how they determine dispatch?  In addtion, if you are not on the distribution list for Belden's memo on utility behavior in California this summer, I will forward it to you.  It suggests some other areas FERC ought to be looking into. 
 Looks like you got this earlier.  I think it has new relevance in light of FERC's announced investigation. 
 It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers. We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution. 
 I will be out of town that day (a meeting I can't move).  Please continue to let me know about future meetings.    Lora Sullivan@ENRON 12/16/99 03:25 PM 
 In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees. 
 We don't have revised versions yet.  when we do, we will probably only want to put some (not all) of the documents on the intranet. 
 I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future). Can we make that argument work? 
 calendar 
 Rosie -- please check Ken's calendar.  This would be a great one to do if we can squeeze it in.  Nick -- congrats on what looks like a great new opportunity to make progress.  I am in all week and would love to talk to you and Joe.  If we can't otherwise make schedules work, call me at home after hours Houston time (713-621-6550). 
 fyi 
 Add Mona Petrochko, peggy mahoney and Rob Bradley 
 Please send to the distribution list 
 While the more-open gas market may have more tools available than in electric markets, market solutions have been proposed as an alternative to legislated rate caps in the hard hit San Diego market.  Gavin -- please send Irwin copies of the articles on the offers made in San Diego. 
 Attached is a draft of the Agenda we discussed.  Irwin - I show Joskow on here but he has already declined (his wife is having surgery right before our meeting date).  We may want to consider someone like Seabron Adamson (Frontier Economics) or perhaps someone else. 
 No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.  Thanks 
 Looks ok 
 looks fine 
 We should include David Oxley -- VP of human resources.

 Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.  Most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.  Could you forward this to Palmer ... for some reason my address book doesn't pull him up when I'm off the system. 
 I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone. 
 Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself. 
 I'm glad things are moving forward.  I've talked with Dave briefly and will= =20 follow up with him again.     Kevin Scott <kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net> on 07/13/2001 10:14:01 AM Please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net 
 Thanks for getting on top of this.  Please get the word out to the HR team leaders as soon as you know more. 
 Congratulations! 
 I'm still a junkie .... please email copies of the orders. 
 See last point:  MIT would like to talk to us about energy procurement and management.  Could you put someone in touch with them? 
 See last story attached.  Congratulations, it looks like you are shaking things up in typical Enron fashion. 
 See attached 
 Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system. 
 I couldn't open link.  I s this something new for me to sign or have I already complied? 
 Attached is the final letter.  Please note - there was a small change at the top of page 2. 
 I'm putting in for Chairman and CEO of rationalizations and euphemisms. 
 I think this is an excellent letter.  I agree with Sue's comments and have included her changes on Page 3.  All changes have been marked in this version. 
 Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business. Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings outlook,"  said Skilling. 
 My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading. 
 As discussed. 
 I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners. California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media. 
 I love you.  Call me. 
 The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances. 
 Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?  If so, please handle; otherwise let me know. 
 fyi 
 Neither Ken nor Jeff are available.  It would probably be better for one of you to speak anyway.  Any interest?

 I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc). 
 A "dedicated room" isn't as bad as it sounds.  It would not be in use full time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already have).  Let me know what you think.  Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving deeper into her group (and next to her files)).

 I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU. Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today. 
 Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings? 
 Looks good to me. 
 I think this letter looks fine.  For the hororarium, I suggest we use whatever we paid Kudlow for his participation (I believe Ken also entered into a consulting contract with Kudlow, but I'm referring only to the one-time payment for the advisory council meeting he attended). 
 Who is Paul Kaufan????? 
 Follow up to previous message:  I would not have "managing for the slow down" on the agenda.  I don't think it is as relevant to our business as it is to many others. 
 I have looked it over.  I think they would do a good job.  Another idea: Dick Foster (advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey) has a great book out: "Creative Destruction".  I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research.  He is a very good presenter; he knows Enron well; and his work is first rate.  He might be a good addition.  I have an idea on the breakout sessions.  It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you. 
 FYI - itinerary. 
 I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the "reregulation threat" at the next meeting.  Below are some of my observations:  While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some of the data). There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to "big oil" (which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market). Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at least on the electricity issue.  We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it.  So, while the issue has the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet (except in places like San Diego and New York city. The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets.  Investigations of out of state "price gougers and profiteers" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place.  They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets. Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets. Ironically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply.  For the most part, though, the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow ... so far. Outside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California's.  Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why "California won't happen here."  For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.  There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.  The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans:  I think it's off the agenda in most places.  The fact that most of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard. At the federal level there has been a combination of the "burn the village in order to save it" approach  -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for comprehensive reform. All in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity:  business is booming;  we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers.  On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action.  Our target has been FERC -- they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the market. Enron's response:  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron -- a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message.  We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.  It's fair to say that they fumbled the ball:  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.  They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.  We are now working the issue directly.  We are working the issue on a number of levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers.  As time goes on, the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better.  2)  Govt relations - we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to build capacity but the government won't let it).  This may be the best environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.  Also, in typical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.  We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates.  Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians.  SDG&E dropped the ball, unfortunately.  Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account.  At the federal level we are contacting members, the DOE and FERC.  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish "leveling the playing field" in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed.  Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away any lingering excuses or delays).  3) Overall messaging -- we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level.  As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working. Overall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot. An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:  much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural gas.  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?  The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate:  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre-deregulation;  long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( the curve is "backwardated" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid the spike?).  When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC.  We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together.  Let me know if there is anything else you need. 
 You have probably heard this already, but on July3, the CPUC postponed their direct access decision until mid-August. 
 Thank you.  I enjoyed the discussion very much.  The DoD has significant challenges, but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication, they have some first rate people working on those challenges.  If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call. 
 Please add Dave Delainey, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchens to updates with significant news like this one (they may already get them ... I didn't read through all the names). 
 Ken hasn't mentioned it.  I'll ask next time I talk to him. 
 Has this gone to Ken yet.  If not please send. 
 Sorry for the delay (I had major e-mail problems).  The memo looks good; let's get it out. 
 Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who. 
 You may want to forward this to your customers. 
 I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week? 
 Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue. Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!

 Steve will be in a Managing Director PRC that day - not sure if he will be out in time for a 5:30 event.  Maureen 
 I get in too late tonight, but maybe dinner or drinks on Thurs? 
 Thanks anyway.  no need to do anything right now.  enjoy your vacation. 
 Fyi - price cap events of the week. 
 Ken left a msg for me on Sunday.  He was able to return Bryson's call.  Not much new:  Ken got Jeff's paper will try to reach Hertzberg on Monday. Bryson gave an update (very consistent with yours on Fri) Wants us to think creatively about "how to keep DWR contracts from preventing the comprehensive solution" and how to address the concerns of the state treasurer. Ken tried to reach Pete Peterson (Blackstone) but did not make contact. 
 I am having lunch on Monday with Michael Isikoff, a newsweek investigative reporter.  He is doing yet another Ken Lay/Enron political influence story. One of the things he wants to talk about though -- and I think this is a good sign -- is Enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the administration's.  What I need from you, as soon as possible, is a timeline (what the Administration said when -- doesn't have to be down to the day); the Administrations position; and our position (and how they differ).  Borrow heavily from existing materials. 
 No need to review with policy committee. 
 I may be adding someone to the agenda -- Vikram Pandit (recommended by Ken Lay and Pug Winokar) 
 Attached is Jeff's backgrounder in the event you call Hertzberg. 
 Thank you...I think 
 Here it is 
 I set up a meeting for next Friday in Washington with Ed G. and Ralph Reed, starting at 7:30 am. 
 I think you are right.  I thought we were going to do both. 
 Would it be possible to use LiveLink to capture the information we gathered for the organization/budget review (such as functions of the different groups and the roles and responsibilities of the different individuals, budgets etc)?  I hate to see all that ggod information sit idle. 
 Please call me. 
 You may have seen this when it first came out a while back ... but it's worth a rerun. 
 Please update my bio to include Human Resources and add some boilerplate on Enron. 
 Can one of you forward to Ed, or whoever you feel appropriate? 
 Looks good; nice work. Let's get it out

 John Brindle, David Cromley and others in the Corporate Business Controls group (formerly part of EBS) have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of Dabhol if there are threats to their safety.  While no plan is perfectly reliable (particularly during monsoon season) we believe that we are as ready as we can be. 
 Will you be filling out mine? 
 We may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee, but I think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway.  I'm sure we'll have something we'll need to talk about. 
 Looks fine to me.  Maureen - please keep on file 
 Attached is the draft.  It combines all three announcements into one, with a common format. It reflects a "just the facts" approach.  Let me know if you have changes (or answers to the questions in the text). 
 Per your discussion with Steve. 
 As we discussed... The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen McVicker (my assistant). 
 How are we handling these now?  Last time I talked to Jeff, we weren't going to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the restrictions).  Any word? 
 The other memo will follow shortly from Maureen. 
 I'm not sure yet.  I think we are going to be sending two memos  -- one that I am working on and on that Andy is working on.  It looks to me like the message below fits better into Andy's memo.  I don't think they will be combined into one, but I'll know more tomorrow. 
 Houston has experienced catastrophic flooding. My flight has been cancelled. It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I should try.  I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.  I don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 15 minute speech. what do you think? phone 713.621.6550

 I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your questions:  both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to Rick Shapiro.  From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and Asia).  Both Rick and Mark report to me.  Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder).  Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time). 
 Could you work with Allison to get the needed information to cathy. 
 Looks good.  Some of his questions suggest he's going to include a fair amount of industry reaction -- which could be a mixed bag, some are clearly threatened by efficiencies in bw markets.  Looks like it will be a really good story.  He definitely appears to be excited by it. 
 A bit lengthy, but I think it looks fine. 
 This is the e-mail I was talking about. 
 I do support the change.  Let me know what I can do to help.  You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, particularly the US.  What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is:  gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.  Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation).  Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue.  It seems to work:  outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues. 
 Please send the economist piece around. 
 No, I had the right date from our previous communications. 
 When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control "path 15"?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these "preferences" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

 what does the siting bill provide for? 
 Skilling will be speaking at the National Press Club next week.  He'll give an overview of Enron's business, talk about what's going on in power markets, and what should be done to fix the current problems.  California will get covered as well.  Other than what we have already discussed, is there anything Jeff should know or address in his remarks? 
 yes  --  just make sure the working group leaders know. 
 Look at this.  Baum finally speaks up  -- way too late. Can somebody tell me what SDG&E's energy rate was pre-dereg? 
 They refer to expedited siting.  What are the provisions? 
 fyi 
 Yes, thanks.  Lay is going to be giving the keynote.  It may be a hard story to assemble: the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets, yet we still have high prices.  It's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on OPEC.  I'm interested in any views you may have. 
 Got your message.  I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine.

 The PAC did not give the money.  PAC contributions to federal candidates are limited.  The money was a combination of individual contributions Ken solicited and soft money donations to the Republican Party. 
 attached is a copy of my california testimony.  The proceeding was somewhat productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points.  Our view on this is:  the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed).  What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now:  Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now.  Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act.  Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.

 The letter looks fine.  Set it up as "your letter to Ken Lay was forwarded to me for response" and have Jeff B sign.  Thanks    Marcia A Linton 09/20/2000 04:04 PM 
 I talked to Hettie today.  It's unlikely that we are going to find time for Jeff and the Governor to talk (because of the Governor's schedule).  We'll try to set something up later.  In the meantime, the Governor should just sign the bill.  Of course, Hettie had already communicated this; the Gov's office acknowledged that the message was recieved but did not make a specific commitment. 
 From November 14-17, Houston will host Gastech 2000, one of the worlds largest international natural gas, LNG, and LPG conferences.  The conference will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center and is expected to attract 3,000 delegates from around the world.  Enron has played a leading role in this conference for many years and this year we will participate as a sponsor and prominent exhibitor.  Exhibit space and several speaking opportunities have been secured.  Ken Lay will serve as a keynote speaker at the event.  We particularly need your participation for the Enron exhibit booth.  Please identify someone from your team to work with Dennis Vegas (713-345-6442) and Hal Means (713-345-5384), who will serve as the overall coordinators for Enron's participation.  Please keep in mind, this year's Management Conference, for VPs and above, is scheduled for November 15 - 17.  Thanks for your help.

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.  Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.  Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal article identifying Linda among the "Washington 100".  We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those was Secretary Summers who said:  "Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met." "Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen."  On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to Linda.

 At the end of the article there is a presidential straw poll.  It shows Bush with only a 6 point lead among oil and gas industry executives and analysts. 
 Joe - could you or someone in the office get in touch with Michelle?  Thanks 
 I understand from Shelley that you are going to be seeing Commissioner Breathitt on Monday.  We have been working to persuade her to vote for forceful FERC action on electricity issues.  She is widely viewed as the swing vote (with Massey and Hoecker being the other two votes) needed for the Commission to take action.  Attached are two documents -- one is a set of talking points for you and the second is a FERC action plan that we are floating with several of the Commissioners. 
 fyi  - there has been some concern that this deal was being put together without Connecticut authorities knowing the full extent of our interest in FCEL. 
 No special requirements, but it's good to keep track of in case we want a point of contact.  Thanks    John Wack@EES 09/22/2000 05:05 PM 
 You should plan to be there.    Michael Terraso 09/22/2000 06:12 PM 
 I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.  For example, how much of the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?  He wants to make the point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.    Margaret Carson 09/21/2000 04:25 PM 
 great news! Keep up the good work.    Stephen D Burns

 Is Catherine working on environmental policy related to sustainability or is she working on greenhouse gas transactions . . . or both? 
 Joe - there is no announcement today.  I tried to leave you a voicemail but apparently the system is down there.  Before we can offer an outside person a VP position, the Executive Committee must sign off.  We are going to be going through that process in a few minutes.  Then we begin the offer extension and negotiations.  The person we are recommending is Linda Robertson, one of the two people I mentioned to you before.  Please guard the information carefully.  Last time we talked, when the list had been narrowed to two, DeLay's office called with the exact two names and started pushing us to hire a Republican.  As you know we interviewed candidates of both political affiliations and just settled on the best person.  Ken told DeLay's office that's how we do things and Ken is comfortable (actually enthused) about the choice.  When some external announcement is done, you will be involved and your considerable contributions will be prominently mentioned.

 Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it more explicit:  The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity infrastructure more than anything else. The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach. Let's start getting the word out!

 Isn't our primary problem with AEP's internal merchant function rather than with the marketing affiliate (I realize we have problems with the affiliate too)?

 More indications that the power angle may be fruitful 
 The senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively, but it does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue. 
 Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.

 I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.    "Hunt, Hunter L" <HLHunt@georgewbush.com> 09/27/2000 11:25 AM

 Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and pricing problems in the California market.  In summary, the proposal would have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.  The gov asked if anyone had successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.  I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or North American) by mid day Monday. Jeff and I will have a follow up call with the governor on Monday.  Thanks

 When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management conference had not yet been scheduled.  Now it has and, of course, it conflicts... it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at Enron.  I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on a couple of candidates:  how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott Magrane(sp?).  The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, was working on Transcos.  Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA so I can take care of the problem. Thanks 
 Am I taking care of you or what?? 
 I mentioned the need to call Gramm in the exec committee meeting today and Ken is willing to do it.  The talking points ISDA sent looked fairly generic.  Given Ken's relationship, and the fact that he has talked to Gramm previously on the subject, what should we ask Ken to cover?  I'd like to give him a background document and talking points like we did last time.  I will send it by fax to you Chris and would appreciate it if you could update it as appropriate. 
 Do you still expect Guinn to call Ken?  If so, do we have updated talking points (and background) for Ken?

 Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.  The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway.  By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.  I know the Southern cone team is moving to make it right, but I see absolutely no reason to come don on anyone about this.

 One of the things you should include in your report to Koenig and Frevert is our preliminary views on the RTO filings.  Perhaps it's simply that we are not going to be satisfied until FERC forces nondiscriminatory access and we will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming.

 Rosie and Sherrie:  Jeff Ken and Joe wanted to discuss the attached.  Joe -- this is the same document I forwarded to you earlier. 
 The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday. 
 My mistake, but no reason to stop the presses. 
 thanks.  the letter is already out, but we will be accurate in follow up calls and in press interviews.    Tim Belden@ECT 10/31/2000 08:33 AM 
 Any interest? 
 Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives. 
 I am out of town. Joe - can you attend?    Laura Evans@EES 10/31/2000 02:27 PM 
 Please ask Ken to sign the following.  But, in the Advisory Council letter delete the reference to the December Board meeting and check with Ken on whether he still plans to brief the Enron Board at the December meeting (I believe he talked to Kelly Kimberly about this). 
 I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:  I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.  I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along.  We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.  Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do.  (Also, my title is just EVP and Chief of Staff)    JMandelker@aol.com 11/01/2000 03:32 PM 
 Did Ken ask us to sponsor it or just consider it?  I'm wondering what if anything we gain from such an investment, but I have an open mind on it.    Joe Hillings 10/30/2000 08:35 AM 
 I'm normally not a big fan of conferences, but this one may be of interest. I think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak: it's possible some utilities may say some of the same things we would say, but they may be less likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond.  Let me know what you think. 
 My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits reference.    Rick Buy@ECT 10/23/2000 02:59 PM

 I don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here, but I have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about reaching agreement on our two key issues.  Can we put the question differently:  what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do together to address those barriers?  If the barriers for EEI are insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?

 If you have not logged onto the PEP system to designate reviewers, or approve reviewers for those in your organization, please do so today.  The deadline for completing performance evaluation information is November 17.  The performance review process is critical to year-end evaluations and bonus, promotion and compensation decisions. This year, as in previous review periods, the system enables "360 degree" feedback throughout the organization.  Please take some time today to get the process started. 
 Attached are the committee lists and organizatinal charts. 
 My copy shows long term comp on the exhibit under "Grant Award".  And yes, the date will be revised. 
 I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday. The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help with the following information: Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have. Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue. Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved. Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation. ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too. CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less than 10%)? Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)? Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility (and the regulators) out of the merchant function. Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need these guys on board. Thanks.

 I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the process works in practice.  A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should remain purely relative. 
 I share your perceptions of Jose, though I don't have as much contact as you do.  I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's work.  I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.    James M Bannantine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 07:13 PM 
 I realize the group may go a different way with this, but I remain convinced that we should go to a pure number system (ie a pure relative ranking) and use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the differences between people.  Just adding the qualifier "relative to peers" glosses over what's really going on.  The behavior and skill descriptors tell everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion.  The relative ranking lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or "looser" on performance rankings, terminations, and comp.    Gina Corteselli 10/16/2000 01:31 PM

 I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.  I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.  I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure number system.  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.  You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations.  I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly.  I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior).  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously.  I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot.  I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping of bounds ... quite the contrary.

 I understood the "validation" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.  I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point). Let's just get this done.

 Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail while she is out.  Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).  But, if this is a standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in California, I think it leaves a bad impression.  Can we find a way to direct urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external lobby team? 
 Per my voicemail, attached is a proposed "statement" to open the Executive Committee meeting on Monday. 
 Let's process this request.  I think it's justified. 
 Eliz -- does this allocation reflect the cuts we have already made? 
 Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.  I just wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.

 There are a few other issues we need to look into:  Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO -- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this "exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative? Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments. Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward. We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible). Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

 per our discussion.  Want to schedule a tour and want to make sure that Marchris is avail (let Rick and Montovano know) 
 What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.  We have debated from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity). Where do we stand?    Charles Yeung@ECT 11/09/2000 11:19 AM 
 I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of things we need to consider. 
 congratulations!  One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.  Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral presentations.  Do you agree?    Robert Hemstock@ECT 11/15/2000 06:28 PM 
 Thanks for the message.  I agree that once we have a good outline of what we are going to do we are going to need someone who can get it done.  I think you would be an outstanding candidate for that role (seems to me we went after you once before).  Is your inquiry confidential or can I discuss it with others?

 As I mentioned at the executive committee meeting, we have a number of people who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe that a call from you to Cheney may be required.  David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team. Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is aware of his interest and is amenable to his service. James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested. Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a republican who works for us in the upper midwest.   Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the "vetting" team as possible.  Let me know how I need to proceed. 
 can you find the contact and see if they are still interested in the money? 
 That flight time is fine.  A couple of other things:  I need to meet with McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.  Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' office.

 Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market.    Susan J Mara 11/17/2000 06:09 PM 
 It looks like a good letter.... heavy on explanation of our position. At some point I'd like to hear more of the background that's leading us to this position.    Richard B Sanders@ECT 11/17/2000 10:19 AM 
 You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to $100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why.  I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a "process".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not exclusively the Chamber's fault).  Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next level, not just protecting its current position.  Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our current dues to $100,000).  Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me. 
 Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.  Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to understand those reasons).  What did the group accomplish?  Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?  Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future? Any changes to the working group process itself?  Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, please provide the feedback by December 1.

As you can see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December Board meeting.  I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors (ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons) if possible. 
 I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.  I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
 Attached are my suggestions. 
 Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the final.  Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.       Peggy Mahoney@EES 11/27/2000 09:39 PM 
 I have a reception that evening (coincidentally with another Rice group -- from the engineering school), so I will not be able to attend.    Jaime Gualy@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 05:48 PM 
 I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's (author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".  We have looked at numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time. I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline.

 Anything you want me to do?    Christi L Nicolay@ECT 11/28/2000 09:23 AM 
 huh? 
 I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc. What do you think?    Peggy Mahoney@EES 11/28/2000 05:27 PM 
 fyi 
 Steve Kean is available on Dec. 5 from 9:30 - 11:30.  Maureen McVicker Steve's Assistant      Luke Amelang 11/29/2000 09:45 AM 
 what do you think 
 Looks good.  Is the co2 reduction only 10.5 tons or is it some multiple, like 10.5 thousand tons?    Peggy Mahoney@EES 11/30/2000 12:31 AM 
 schedule 
 Please send an estimate of time and description of the topic to Rebecca. 
 Thanks.  Look at the attached ... it may be too late for this afternoon, but I took a shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated issues (substitute for slides 15-17?) 
 I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments. 
 please block off on my calendar 
 key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by his vision for a new approach to the energy business.    Cindy Derecskey 12/01/2000 02:28 PM

 Shapiro is just unwilling to accept the fact that his guy is a very scary guy ... enough to scare away lifelong democrats.  I got your voicemail.  Thanks for following up. We would be looking for a contract relationship only, not full time. 
 can we get Gary's comments? 
 we'll try to get a copy of gary's comments 
 can we get a copy of gary's comments from cnbc? 
 do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution. We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail? 
 I have been trying to hook up with Kevin and will see him tomorrow.  I still prefer to use the "old exec committee plus" for this PRC with a reformed MD PRC starting at mid year.  We have too many people in transition to just switch over to the policy committee at this stage.    Cindy Olson 12/04/2000 09:10 AM 
 Talking points from Steve's discussion with Ken;  do not circulate. 
 Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to power and gas pricing, particularly in California.  Included are a detailed set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary designed for more general audiences and the media.  The gas paper was prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.  I will get a more integrated message put together and circulated. 
 I agree that we need to rework the copy, especially since the gas market is blowing up.    Karen Denne 12/04/2000 12:33 PM 
 How are the appointments turning out from your perspective? 
 Attached is the accomplishment discussion to go with the public affairs goals -- let me know if this is sufficient and consistent with what you want to present.... I can provide more detail if needed.    Karen Myer 12/04/2000 05:16 PM 
 In the first sentence could we say "transmission owning market participant".    Christi L Nicolay@ECT 12/04/2000 05:52 PM 
 here is the attachment        Karen Myer 12/04/2000 05:16 PM 
 I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until we have legal (including FCPA) approval.  I have exchanged voicemails with Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.  If you have consulted local counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth. Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later (as we have in other cases).  This issue has come up before in Europe.  The first time through is the hardest and slowest.  After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent requests move faster.  But we have to get it right.  Even in Europe, where our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in Europe -- even where other American companies don't).    Nicholas O'Day 12/04/2000 07:12 PM 
 I have also received regrets from Horton, but confirmation from Metts 
 Do you have an "alumni" list of analysts/associates in key positions at Enron? 
 Please plan to attend a meeting at 5:00 p.m. TODAY, regarding the gas and power price situation in California.  We will be discussing political, legal and PR implications and actions.   TIME:    5:00 p.m.  PLACE:   EB 3321 (for those in Houston)  CALL IN #:   888-422-7109  HOST CODE:   494397  (for Steve Kean's use only)  PARTICIPANT CODE: 425223 
 Just got word from the lawyers: it's a go. 
 I need to talk to you about Wasaff's project when you get a chance .... tomorrow, if possible,b ut not absolutely necessary.  Hope all is well. 
 Looks fine to me.  Dan, I assume you are comfortable with it.    Karen Denne 12/06/2000 05:06 PM 
 LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind (Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.  Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, or find him something through the redeployment process?

 No problem    <Suzanne_Nimocks@mckinsey.com> 12/07/2000 02:18 PM 
 I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.  I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.  I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.  I think that's probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses the ranges in the MD level. 
 Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.  Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's PRC.  If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.    Kelly Kimberly@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/10/2000 01:31 PM 
 I think the message Christi prepared is great.  Check with her one last time and then let it  go. 
 claendar 
 Can Rick attend.  need one other person too 
 I agree.  It doesn't appear that we have the need for his skills that we had even a few months ago.  I see that you are in contact with Michelle Hargrave about next steps.  Anything you want me to do at this point?    Mark Schroeder@ECT 12/08/2000 11:23 AM 
 Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably already have this, Lisa).  This organization represents perhaps the biggest near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory fora, and perhaps new countries.  From time to time, I'm sure we will all be called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive. 
 It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call out" number from the charts ... specifically,what happened to microsoft's turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?    Suzanne Brown@ECT 12/07/2000 11:39 AM 
 It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color scheme looks good.    Gina Corteselli 12/07/2000 08:03 AM 
 Mo - please set up a call 
 Cindy -- it seems to me we should use an HR distribution to get this out. Let Mike and I know what you think. 
 Dolores:  I'm sorry, but Steve just let me know that he will not be able to attend tomorrow's luncheon.  Hope this doesn't cause too many problems.  Thanks.   Maureen      Dolores Fisher 12/12/2000 10:49 AM 
 Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, so there is no demand response when prices rise.  On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4. Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 12/12/2000 02:40 PM 
 Congratulations! 
 calendar and respond 
 Yes, you are. 
 Thanks for the message. 
 That's OK, I was going to use it in the presentation, but it wasn't essential.  Was my talk what you were looking for? 
 I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues.  I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora.  I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.  I look forward to the discussion.    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/17/2000 02:20 PM 
 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as primary contacts for the operating companies:  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere  EES: Harry Kingerski  ENA: Jim Steffes  In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report to Steve Kean in that capacity.  There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a "go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies. 
 Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! 
 Any follow up questions or India press about the bloomeberg story I sent you yesterday? 
 fyi 
 Joe asked me to get in touch with you regarding Indian media reports/inquiries on possible sale or sell down of Dabhol and to discuss a possible statement in the event we get additional inquiries.  Give me a call - 713-853-1586, home: 713-621-6550; pager: 888-906-9761. 
 I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.  This gives them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got price protection".  On the messages we need to include Mark's top three:  1) price caps cause shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together) 
 I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection.  The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems.  On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering). 
 I do not.    Enron Energy Services

 Preliminary congratulations!.    Looks like a good plan.  Keep me posted. 
 I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.  We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.  the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement, not after the group gets underway.  Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/18/2000 05:03 PM 
 Wow!  Was this expected? 
 Anybody at the CFTC or on the hill we want to send brochures to? 
 Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records?  It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts.   Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.  What do you think? 
 I still need to talk to you about our public message in India.  I am on my way to Calgary tonight.  My hotel number is 403-266-7331.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the referral.  We definitely want to get our story out to these guys.  Just for future reference, Meredith Phillipp is handling "New Media" for us.  Thanks 
 Strong work, Laura! 
 Will we capture these "accelerations" in our accomplishments? 
 Baby, I'm going to San Francisco on Aug 14?(Sunday) returning Wednesday. Wanna go?? 
 Attached are my comments on the Bliley amendment to the Largent amendment. 
 Let's add this to our daily distribution. 
 We don't know yet.  He has been invited and we expect most will show up, but we won't know until they do.    Enron Energy Services 
 In the underscored language added to the RTO section I would insert "access to" between the words "planning" and "maintenance".    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/20/2000 06:22 AM 
 I have you down as a "yes" to attend the meeting.  Maureen McVicker (Steve's assistant) 
 Let's take the opportunity.    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/19/2000 06:32 PM 
 I do too, but I think you should send it with the appropriate caveats (which I communicated verbally to her). 
 Fine 
 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - -  Seeking Advice of Counsel - -  Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment.  The groundrules for using these statements are as follows:  All press inquiries should be directed to Eric Thode.  We will use the more "basic statement" unless press inquiries are specific and informed by knowledgeable industry participants.  We will use only those parts of the more detailed statement which are necessary.  The document begins with a background piece to briefly educate Enron personnel who may not be aware of Project Stanley but may be called upon to respond to regulators' or customers' inquiries.  Aleck - - please get Seabrou's help filling in the blanks.  Richard - - feel free to forward to outside counsel as you see fit. 
 Richard:  Please do not forward the Project Stanley email that we sent to you earlier today.  I am making some revisions and will forward the revised document out to you and the others.  Thanks. 
 Looks good. 
 looks good 
 I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.  Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to). That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.    Rob Wilson@ENRON 07/24/2000 04:44 PM 
 My message was sent before I finished it. I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay --  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences. Good luck with your studies. My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.    Rob Wilson@ENRON 07/24/2000 04:44 PM 
 Thanks for the update.  Congratulations on your progress.
