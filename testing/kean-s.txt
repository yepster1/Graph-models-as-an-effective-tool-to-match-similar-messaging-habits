an, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios. 
 I don't think so. 
 Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft. Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it. 
 Some good news.  Your call to Gov Rowland was helpful.  We are not finished yet, but we are on our way. 
 Thanks for thinking of us.  We have retained a crisis communications firm  -- Kekst &CO. -- to assist us.  They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken. 
 ok 
 In case you need to reach someone in IR or PR, here are 24-hour numbers. 
 Board meeting running long. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 The deal is final.  Attached are some communication materials for you to use. 
 please provide your thouhgts to Peggy

 If you'd like, I can set up a tour of the Enron Center for you and anyone else you'd like to include. 
  I agree with Beth.  We had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage, but the Dynegy option was the best.  It's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down. 
 This msg is about new bldg tour -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Anything further yet? 
 Irwin is on Enron's advisory council.  Could one of you send him a reply? 
  fyi 
 Linda was assistant secy of US Treasury while this legislation was being negotiated.  Let us know if we can help. 
 Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:  Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around. Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances. If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could: Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition. Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief. (You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.) We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service. EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession. We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms. Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal. 
 Ken talked with Barton.  Barton will not be signing the letter The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill. Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will). I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter). 
 Thanks for the message.  I don't know of anything moving forward as yet. 
 I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing. 
  Could you take a look at this? 
 Thanks for the invite.  We will probably still be on our way back from New Mexico (we're driving), so we won't be able to come.  Have a good time ... I know you will. 
 I hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.  I understand that Ken and Chuck have spoken and that Greg, Stan, and Dave will be coming over at 3:00 and no one is expected to be there at 1:00.  Correct? 
  please find Bob Lane's phone number for Rick 
 Thanks for the inquiry; I appreciate the interest very much.  But I am not interested in participating. 
 Please review and comment on the attached 
 Please review for send out Monday. 
 please call me re the attached 
 See revised version attached. 
 Melissa's mom will be coming, so we will be sticking around Hous. 
 Absolutely.  Send electronically, if possible.  Thanks 
 thank you and good luck.  Stay in touch 
 It asked me for login info. 
 See minor comment and then circulate to the larger group. 
 Ask everyone to send you the info to fill in the blanks (and to copy the others on the list).  Perhaps you could join in on Oxley's 6:00 call...I'll ask by copy of this message. 
 I'm sorry ... I told mom, Phil and Karen, but not you... Francis died two weeks ago.  Norma is fine.  She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas). 
 Thanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill.  Am I missing something?  Do I have Enron stock I can sell to offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas? 
 Michelle - can you respond?  I haven't seen anything.  Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution. 
 Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow. 
 Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my Enron."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best. 
 I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.  Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one. 
 As discussed. 
  Please prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature.  Please get me his phone number and get his fax number, so we can fax as well as mail the letter. 
  I am terminating McLarty today.  We can't terminate with Kissinger yet.  I = think we also need to terminate our agreement with Sue Walden.  Do you have= the agreement? 
  If you are checking e-mail, show this to Nora. 
 Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.  Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I don't have any comments to add. 
 Attached is the draft release.  I didn't mean to come across too pessimistic on the way in this am.  The release does contain good news and we need toget it out as soon as we can. 
    This is an article that Irwin Stelzer wrote abut Enron.  He is willing to talk further.  His number is 202.777.3000.  He said he would like to have me on the phone when you call. 
 You should read this.  You won't like some of the comparisons, but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished. 
  What do you think? 
 thanks 
 OK with you? 
 Rick -- I'm so sorry to hear about this, but I'm glad the outlook is good.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 
 Thank you.  I look forward to seeing you again in the interview process. 
 I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go. 
 FYI and please handle. 
 please schedule 
 I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.   There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.  I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.  Again, my thanks. 
 I think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.  More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything. 
 Here is the electronic copy. 
 This relates to the EPA region 9 issue we discussed last week 
 Has Koenig seen the IR section?  I don't agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors.  I can't believe he would think that's accurate. 
  Rick -- per my voicemail 
 I don't think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed.  I don't think they will and I think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take.  Also, I want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don't slow down the "badge in" process.  The other recommendations look fine to me.  I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval. 
 Thanks for the update.  Your approach makes sense to me. 
 FYI 
 As we discussed 
 Please see attached revised travel advisory.  I think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests. 
 No word yet. I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow.  FYI,  I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin. 
  Per my voicemail.  I'll be seeing Barton today in Austin and will make these points as well. 
 I wrote a letter of recommendation for you (you're getting it whether you want it or not). 
 Yes and yes 
 I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday.  The message they are stressing is that FERC is injecting much needed certainty.  I think we should add that to our message as well. 
  I would like to see him if it works on my schedule 
 Per my voicemail 
 calendar 
 I think this is fine.  It lends itself to an outline format, so I suggest converting to Word and make it a one-two page "leave behind".

 Thank you. I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.  And yes I am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 thanks so much for the note.  I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.  My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.  I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I'll be glad when this one is over). 
 Thanks 
 I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).  The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).  Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work. 
 Please print. 
 Thank you.  I also enjoyed our discussion very much.  Your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive.  You will be getting a call shortly, if you haven't already, inviting you to our weekend event later this month.  Please come. 
 I believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj? 
 I have received my worldcom card 
  fyi 
 We have already submitted our budget for PR, Govt' affairs, Facilities, corp HR etc.  Does the process below affect my numbers (please say no). 
 I will bring John BRindle. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Please send Pam Benson the information for Joe on where to send the check, who to make it out to , etc 
 I will attend. 
 Please do send it out. Thanks for the kind words.  I know you know how I feel about your work and I have shared that view widely.  I have enjoyed working with you; I always valued your insights , your responsiveness, and your work ehtic.  I wish you all the best in your new role. 
 These are good fixes.  I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly. 
 Sherrie and Rosie:  Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about designating portions of their contributions for use  in Texas.  Mr. DeLay would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint letter).  It is, of course, up to Ken and Jeff whether to make the designation. 
 Lou -- you may be maxed out on Franks now.  Don't write a check for the August fundraiser until you have talked to Eliz Labanowski 
 If you think this is worth pursuing, get in touch with Christie. 
 Offer him the job.    Rob Bradley@ENRON 07/25/2000 12:40 PM 
 What do you think? 
 I think you, or someone in your group, should cover this.  The attendees are operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting, interconnection and environmental issues.  Also, from a more macro perspective, what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on operators  -- the importance of flexibility in asset operations (ie the premium the market will place on quick response) or the challenges of different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets. 
 Maybe we should knock down the walls of those cavernous offices on the top= =20 floor. 
 I wuold like to attend if my calendar is open 
 JUST A REMINDER:  The answer to the United Way Pre-qualifying Questionnaire need to be turned in by the end of tomorrow, July 26, 2000.  To find the questionnaire form to submit - see the email sent from the United Way Campaign 2000, dated 7/19/00.  I encourage you all to participate.  Thanks. 
 Enron has begun its executive solicitation for United Way.  You should have received an email providing the intranet address where you can pledge online. (Please note:  when entering the information online - enter 4 digits for your birth year).  I encourage you to be the leaders in giving for Governmental Affairs/Public Relations and make your pledge this week.  Further, please invite the generous participation of the people in your groups.  Thank you for your involvement. 
 I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend some time with them. 
 I'd like to get about 30 minutes with Mark, just to catch up. 
 ditto -- nice work Rob.  Your insights on project stanley are also much appreciated. 
 Please revise the document as Aleck's changes indicate.  With respect to the alternative responses shown near the end of the document, leave both alternatives in.

 See below.  this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps, because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west.  In addition, if you get questions from the analysts on "reregulation" or price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services . . .  even a $250 price cap is 5-10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying. 
 See below.   This would have presented a bigger problem than price caps. 
 Any problem? please advise Don. 
 Tim -- Cindy manages this program. Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on this. Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic attempts of shareholders to add
