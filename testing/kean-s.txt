 As I mentioned at the executive committee meeting, we have a number of people who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe that a call from you to Cheney may be required.  David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team. Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is aware of his interest and is amenable to his service. James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested. Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a republican who works for us in the upper midwest.   Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the "vetting" team as possible.  Let me know how I need to proceed. 
 can you find the contact and see if they are still interested in the money? 
 That flight time is fine.  A couple of other things:  I need to meet with McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.  Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' office.  Also, my return should be first thing Tuesday morning (I think we had discussed Monday night originally).  Just get me on the first available flight to Roswell.  Also, I didn't mean to put you in  a difficult spot with Melissa.  I had tried getting hold of her last night but only got the answering machine. Don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule.  If I haven't told her first, I'll deal with the consequences (I've logged "couch time" before plus I'm usually pretty good about keeping her up to date). Thanks    Maureen McVicker 11/16/2000 02:44 PM 
 I think this is something we should consider.  I'm asking Rob to look into it.    "Gilbert R. Whitaker, Jr." <grwhit@rice.edu> 11/16/2000 02:06 PM

 Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market.    Susan J Mara 11/17/2000 06:09 PM 
 It looks like a good letter.... heavy on explanation of our position. At some point I'd like to hear more of the background that's leading us to this position.    Richard B Sanders@ECT 11/17/2000 10:19 AM 
 You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to $100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why.  I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a "process".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not exclusively the Chamber's fault).  Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next level, not just protecting its current position.  Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our current dues to $100,000).  Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me. 
 Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.  Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to understand those reasons).  What did the group accomplish?  Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?  Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future? Any changes to the working group process itself?  Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, please provide the feedback by December 1.

 Great work.  Any indication that the publication of the Stanley investigation is having any adverse effect? 
 meeting file 
 I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December Board meeting.  I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors (ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons) if possible. 
 I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.  I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
 Attached are my suggestions. 
 Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the final.  Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.       Peggy Mahoney@EES 11/27/2000 09:39 PM 
 I have a reception that evening (coincidentally with another Rice group -- from the engineering school), so I will not be able to attend.    Jaime Gualy@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 05:48 PM 
 I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's (author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".  We have looked at numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time. I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline.

 huh? 
 I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc. What do you think?

 Thanks.  Look at the attached ... it may be too late for this afternoon, but I took a shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated issues (substitute for slides 15-17?) 
 I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments. 
 please block off on my calendar 
 key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by his vision for a new approach to the energy business.

 do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution. We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail? 
 I have been trying to hook up with Kevin and will see him tomorrow.  I still prefer to use the "old exec committee plus" for this PRC with a reformed MD PRC starting at mid year.

 Talking points from Steve's discussion with Ken;  do not circulate. 
 Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to power and gas pricing, particularly in California.  Included are a detailed set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary designed for more general audiences and the media.  The gas paper was prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.  I will get a more integrated message put together and circulated. 
 I agree that we need to rework the copy, especially since the gas market is blowing up.    Karen Denne 12/04/2000 12:33 PM

 I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until we have legal (including FCPA) approval.  I have exchanged voicemails with Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.  If you have consulted local counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth. Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later (as we have in other cases).  This issue has come up before in Europe.  The first time through is the hardest and slowest.  After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent requests move faster.  But we have to get it right.  Even in Europe, where our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in Europe -- even where other American companies don't).

 LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind (Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.  Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, or find him something through the redeployment process?

 No problem    <Suzanne_Nimocks@mckinsey.com> 12/07/2000 02:18 PM 
 I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.  I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.  I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.  I think that's probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses the ranges in the MD level. 
 Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.  Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's PRC.  If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.    Kelly Kimberly@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/10/2000 01:31 PM

 I agree.  It doesn't appear that we have the need for his skills that we had even a few months ago.  I see that you are in contact with Michelle Hargrave about next steps.  Anything you want me to do at this point?    Mark Schroeder@ECT 12/08/2000 11:23 AM 
 Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably already have this, Lisa).  This organization represents perhaps the biggest near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory fora, and perhaps new countries.  From time to time, I'm sure we will all be called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive. 
 It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call out" number from the charts ... specifically,what happened to microsoft's turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?

 Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, so there is no demand response when prices rise.  On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4. Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 12/12/2000 02:40 PM

 Yes, you are. 
 Thanks for the message. 
 That's OK, I was going to use it in the presentation, but it wasn't essential.  Was my talk what you were looking for? 
 I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues.  I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora.  I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.  I look forward to the discussion.    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/17/2000 02:20 PM 
 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as primary contacts for the operating companies:  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere  EES: Harry Kingerski  ENA: Jim Steffes  In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report to Steve Kean in that capacity.  There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a "go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.

 I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.  This gives them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got price protection".  On the messages we need to include Mark's top three:  1) price caps cause shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together) 
 I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection.  The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems.  On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

 Preliminary congratulations!.    Looks like a good plan.  Keep me posted. 
 I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.  We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.  the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement, not after the group gets underway.  Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?    Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 07/18/2000 05:03 PM 
 Wow!  Was this expected? 
 Anybody at the CFTC or on the hill we want to send brochures to? 
 Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records?  It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts.   Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.  What do you think? 
 I still need to talk to you about our public message in India.  I am on my way to Calgary tonight.  My hotel number is 403-266-7331.  Thanks.

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - -  Seeking Advice of Counsel - -  Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment.  The groundrules for using these statements are as follows:  All press inquiries should be directed to Eric Thode.  We will use the more "basic statement" unless press inquiries are specific and informed by knowledgeable industry participants.  We will use only those parts of the more detailed statement which are necessary.  The document begins with a background piece to briefly educate Enron personnel who may not be aware of Project Stanley but may be called upon to respond to regulators' or customers' inquiries.  Aleck - - please get Seabrou's help filling in the blanks.  Richard - - feel free to forward to outside counsel as you see fit. 
 Richard:  Please do not forward the Project Stanley email that we sent to you earlier today.  I am making some revisions and will forward the revised document out to you and the others.  Thanks. 
 Looks good.

 I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.  Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to). That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful.

 My message was sent before I finished it. I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay --  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences. Good luck with your studies. My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.

 Thanks for the update.  Congratulations on your progress.
