 Health Tips and News The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:  Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true? A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.  Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables? A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop.  Q: Is beer or wine bad for me? A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories= : animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.  Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio? A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.  Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench press. What did he mean? A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin= d that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t= o reevaluate your exercise program.  Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis= e program? A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No Pain.  Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer? A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.  Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you? A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you?  Q: What's the secret to healthy eating? A: Thicker gravy.  Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle? A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul= d only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.  =7F <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Shawn Shafai IT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management Cisco Systems, Inc.

 Janie, Please send a GTC Confirm out on this buyback deal.  It only has a one month duration.  Please call if you have any questions.    Janie Aguayo 04/27/2001 03:39 PM 
 Not my deal...... 
 Dave, I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I have a number of questions. 1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB. 2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for such non scheduled excess volumes? Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the transaction agreement.    Dave Fuller 04/29/2001 12:14 PM 
 Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back please.

 Barbara, According to the Restructuring of Gas Purchase and Sales Contracts between ENA and Entex, Entex is to purchase their natural gas requirements for General Service Customers from ENA except for (i) approximately 30 Bcf per year to be purchased from other suppliers at points other than Conroe; (ii) gas currently purchased from 2 other suppliers at Conroe; (iii) 10,000 MMBtu of gas per day purchased from a third party during the period 4/1/99-3/31/2002; (iv) volumes Entex purchases from HPL under 2/8/76 gas supply agreement; (v) 6,000 MMBtu  per day Entex currently transports on HPL under 1991 transportation agreement.

 Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of showing changes. 
 A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone. Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!" All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her. She committed suicide!" 
 If furtherance to my above reply, EFI and EPOS should not be EOL parties, at least not under the Dominion Republic and Guatemala agreements.    Leslie Hansen 11/01/2000 10:29 AM 
 Phil DeMoes asked me to forward this document for your review. 
 Troy, I have modified the agreement and have forwarded to you the final version which we and they should sign. 
 Gary, The final version is attached for you to send to the customer and have them sign and return 2 originals to HPL.  We can then sign and give them one original. 
 Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it is now your watch.  The only thing that might occur is Mark Breese.  I have placed a voice mail to him in response to his Detroit rfp but he is out.  The deal should be okay assuming Mark can make the prices work.  Anyway, I will handle with Mark.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  I will be back Friday to resume the watch.  See ya! 
 Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me know.  I don't know how many are going to show and eat.  I will leave the beans, potato salad, chips and desserts to you and Bettye.

 Michael, Please note that the footer is wrong on the 1999 MTBE doc.  It should be 98002gctr.doc instead of 98002fctr.doc. Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Ellen, Attached please find a GTC confirm that I prepared for the requested deal done by Janet Wallis.  Please call if you have any questions.  I have asked Janet to forward to New Gulf if the GTC correctly reflects her transaction. I will notify you if there are any changes. 
 Thank you.  Phil made me promise to ask. 
 Jeff, We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the case? Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for a career opportunity with HPL. 
 Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream. The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved through arbitration.  Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to Upstream. 
 Kim, Please review and if okay please send out for signature.  Thank you. 
 I agree with the corrected amount.  Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Spell check doesn't work on numbers or capitals.    Megan Parker@ENRON 05/17/2001 01:10 PM 
 Janet, The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.       Janet H Wallis/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 10:38 AM 
 Cheryl, I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group has already indicated that they did not have it.    Cheryl Dudley 05/17/2001 04:20 PM 
 Stacey, I am sorry that you got involved.  The HPL group had already indicated that they did not have the documents. 
 I intend to be out every other Wednesday plus a few other dates.  Jeff's traveling schedule has messed up my plans for next Monday.  Now I am trying to reshuffle and will get you my plans as soon as I can communicate with Jeff after he returns from his European travels. 
 Janet, Here is a red line of the changes we discussed.  If you agree, let me know what you want next with this deal. 
 Attached is a memo of the major items in their comments to our requested changes.  Let me know when you are ready to discuss. 
 Brant, EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan. 
 Why are you sending this to me?  Shouldn't it have been the GISB which you are modifying as we discussed Friday?    Debra Perlingiere 05/21/2001 09:50 AM 
 Looks okay to send to counterparty for signature.  Please send.    Debra Perlingiere 05/21/2001 03:09 PM 
 Please review my first draft.  I still need to add language to properly reflect the indices being used. Please forward to my any changes that you may desire or that may be needed.

 Okay, I think, can you red line against the previous wording? 
 I checked, it is okay. 
 In case I forgot to send you a copy. 
 Troy, It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things don't happen.    Troy Black/ENRON@enronXgate 05/22/2001 10:50 AM 
 Richard, Please change the last paragraph of the Confirmation to provide that it must be signed by each party and provide signature lines for both parties.    Richard Deming@ENRON 05/23/2001 05:05 PM 
 I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise. 
 THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER  A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.  The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?" 
 Lee, Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in structuring the transaction in this manner.       Lee L Papayoti 05/23/2001 03:54 PM 
 Revised as requested.  Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Lisa, Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of guarantees provided by the credit group.

Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895. 
 Attached please find the revised Spot Confirmation that needs to be sent by fax to each of the counterparties named in the Spot Confirmation.  I have added language requiring them to sign and return by fax a copy of their acceptance to the deal terms.  Please attach the GTC Spot terms to the Spot Confirm when it is sent out.  Also, please let Russell Diamond know when this is sent out and whether we get their faxed signature back. 
 Barbara Gray asked me to forward the below information to you concerning a Enron Corp, guaranty agreement which was not on the original list of agreements.

 Mike,  In response to your voice mail, yes the change from Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. (ECTR) to Enron North America Corp. (ENA) was a name change.  The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for General Service Customers - Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions dated effective as of April 1, 1999 between ECTR and Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. is 96019120.  The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for Large Commercial and Industrial Consumers dated effective as of May 1, 1995 between ECTR (assignee of HPL Resources Company) and Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. is 96004582.

 Robert, Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.    Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:21 PM

 Robert, I have modified the attached as requested.    Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:48 PM 
 Cathy, At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, I would approve them for execution. Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services. No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request forms. 
 I was not out any days during this period. 
 FYI 
 Keith Ford with TXU Fuel Company confirmed to me this morning that TXU had agreed to consent to the assignment of the contracts and that he would fax the signed consent to me as soon as he could get an officer to sign same.  He agreed to send me a letter to that affect in the event he was unable to get a signature today.

 Chris, Anne Koehler asked me to email the attached red-line assignment to you for her review and revision.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is (713) 853-6895. 
 Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke documents for you to print off and have signed. 
 Here's the duke documents. 
 Robert, My fax number is 713-646-3490.    Robert Rose@ENRON 05/31/2001 03:57 PM 
 Ellen, This should be okay.  I would prefer that all GTCs in excess of 6 months be prepared for signature by both ENA and the counterparty.  Is this a problem? 
 Richard, Please fix the confirm so that it shows signature to be provided by both ENA and the Counterparty.    Richard Deming@ENRON 05/23/2001 05:05 PM 
 THE STRONGEST MAN  Ted walks into a bar and shouts out, "Who's the strongest person in here?"  The toughest guy looks at him and says, "I am the strongest person around these parts!"  Ted politely asks, "Can you help me push my car to the gas station?"    HE SAID/SHE SAID  He said... I don't know why you wear a bra;  you've got nothing to put in it. She said...You wear briefs, don't you?  He said....Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune? She said...Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the money.  She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk? He said....It's not my fault...I ran out of money.  He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in the worst way. She said...Well, you succeeded.  He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you? She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror.  He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight. She said...Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.  He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm? She said...I would, but you're never there.  He said....Shall we try a different position tonight? She said...That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on the sofa and fart." 
 As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call me if you need anything further regarding this matter. 
 Again, "I accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement."  Please acknowledge receipt of this.  Thank you. 
 I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois. This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed. 
 Sorry about that, I am guilty of coping the address info from prior memos.  I will update my memos.  Is the last one a Hunt Oil Company processing rights letter?  That was the last item i transmitted.    Stacey Richardson 06/01/2001 02:58 PM 
 Have you had any luck in finding Ann Elizabeth's form? 
 Becky, I honestly do not remember this one.  Cannot rate.    Becky Spencer 06/04/2001 07:58 AM 
 Cathy, I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.    caszasz@aep.com 06/01/2001 03:31 PM 
 Stacy, Please let them know that they are using the wrong assignment list.  Remind them that the list was changing as late as noon Friday.  They need to check the final list.  They can get that from George Weismann.    Stacy E Dickson 06/04/2001 09:04 AM 
 Richard, Please use the attached.  I have continued Credit's requirement which they required for the January 22, 2001 confirm.     Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 11:29 AM 
 Richard, Please set it up for each party to sign.  Signature for a 18 month deal is mandatory.  Has credit approved the deal?    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 12:02 PM 
 Please look over the attached document?  If okay, please complete and send.     Steve HPL Schneider 06/01/2001 03:33 PM

 Lee, I have removed the collateral requirements from this document because we have blanket security request rights in the base contract.  Don't you agree? 
 Any luck? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Vanessa, Can you determine what this is about? 
 Debra, Do we have any agreements with Sempra which could be used for this long term deal? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes. 
 Richard, This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra. Thank you.    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 01:52 PM 
 Russell, It is time for a master with this counterparty.  Please send the credit sheet to Debra so that she can prepare the master. 
 Gerald, Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient? 
 FEMALE FLYERS  As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, "Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and crew take you safely to your destination."?  Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the captain a woman?"  "Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."  "My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."  "That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the cockpit." 
 Nelson, Please use the above.  Don't forget to add your language in the last paragraph.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Attached please find a clean and redline document reflecting the changes we discussed this morning.  Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/06/2001 07:25 AM 
 Again 
 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no bill of sale is needed.    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 06:49 AM 
 clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 10:58 AM 
 sounds good.    rrrose@aep.com 06/07/2001 12:34 PM 
 Nelson, You are aware that ENA is prohibited from bidding on the Texas volumes for a period of 3 months.  Call me if you need any explanation. 
 Tanya, I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office. The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice. Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature. 
 Dan, I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads "above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, please call and I will modify. 
 Can you add or attach the attachment that you refer to in your note to Jeff Hodge. 
 Barbara, This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have any thoughts. 
 Barry, Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 02:58 PM 
 Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by "fixed price" in the other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 03:27 PM

 Barry, The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please advise. 
 I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to hopefully ignore the long line of traffic trying to get into downtown. 
 No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 234-4204.    Steven Curlee@ENRON 11/06/2000 02:21 PM 
 Barry, Can you elaborate on what you are referring to about AOS daily balancing agreement?  Is this something that Stacy Dickson prepared for you?  If so, please attach a copy for my review.    Barry Tycholiz 11/06/2000 05:01 PM 
 Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.  Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions? 
 Did you get to respond to my voicemail regarding the subject?  If not, please send me credit worksheet.  ASAP 
 Attached please find corrected copies of the subject agreements. 
 Barry, I have attached Stacy's document.  Please advise if you are going to send it out on ENA stationary, or should I direct the Confirm Desk to send it out.    Barry Tycholiz 11/07/2000 01:49 PM 
 Bob, Can you determine from the attached if we have a current deal to amend, or is this simply a new deal under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.?  Please advise. 
 Ellen, We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications after that date.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 11/07/2000 05:12 PM 
 Cheryl, Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document.    Cheryl Dudley 11/08/2000 10:36 AM 
 What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise? 
 Please explain, confirms are sent out by the confirm desk.  why is this sent to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal number is greek.    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 Please send hard copy of deal ticket.  We do not have access.  Otherwise, I think the worksheet is incomplete.  Please complete and include with hard copy of deal ticket.  Has the counterparty requested an Enron Corp guaranty as a condition of doing the deal?    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/08/2000 03:48 PM 
 Kevin, As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.  1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 31, 2000.  2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of the essence in this Agreement..  3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and receive from Seller for such day.  4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any indemnity provision or otherwise.  5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1. Enron North America Corp. P. O. Box 4428 Houston, Texas 77210-4428 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816. 
 Oscar, I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this morning. 
 Gregg, I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant. 
 Russell, I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical guaranty that you currently have from coastal.    Russell Diamond 11/10/2000 02:23 PM 
 Stacy, The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire. 
 The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:  Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.  The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do not have copies of these 2 amendments.  At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe these documents. 
 Ellen, Would you mind responding to Barry regarding these confirms.  Thank you. 
 Ellen, I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2 proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.  If these meet with your approval, let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign. Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section 4.2. 
 I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you know if they get executed. 
 The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach something for me to review?    Kevin Ruscitti 11/13/2000 04:42 PM 
 They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the contract is signed by ENA..    Kevin Ruscitti 11/14/2000 12:01 PM 
 Barbara & Anne, I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, Joe would like as much up front notice as possible. 
 Randy, I have attached a simple release and settlement agreement for you use with the customer.  Please call if you need anything further. 
 Veronica, The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name "Enron North America Corp." in the first paragraph.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 11/14/2000 03:56 PM 
 Now why did you send this to me.  I believe that I was aware that you were out of the office.    Stacy E Dickson 11/15/2000 06:19 PM 
 Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/15/2000 12:39 PM 
 Russell, The guaranty documents are attached.  Please impress upon your contact that we need separate guaranty documents for ena and for hpl.  Call if you need anything further. 
 I could use all four.    Janette Elbertson 11/16/2000 11:48 AM 
 Why couldn't this be done with a new GTC confirm for the extension period? 
 Sounds good, count me in.  I will let you know if anything changes.    Lee L Papayoti 05/01/2001 04:15 PM 
 I forwarded a request to Russell for the credit worksheet on 11/08.  No response to date.  I will forward our master to them once I get the credit worksheet.    Jeffrey T Hodge 11/16/2000 01:24 PM 
 Mike, The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day tomorrow.
