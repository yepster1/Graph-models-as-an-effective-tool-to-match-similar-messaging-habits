 Stacy, Please let them know that they are using the wrong assignment list.  Remind them that the list was changing as late as noon Friday.  They need to check the final list.  They can get that from George Weismann.    Stacy E Dickson 06/04/2001 09:04 AM 
 Richard, Please use the attached.  I have continued Credit's requirement which they required for the January 22, 2001 confirm.     Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 11:29 AM 
 Richard, Please set it up for each party to sign.  Signature for a 18 month deal is mandatory.  Has credit approved the deal?    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 12:02 PM 
 Please look over the attached document?  If okay, please complete and send.     Steve HPL Schneider 06/01/2001 03:33 PM

 Lee, I have removed the collateral requirements from this document because we have blanket security request rights in the base contract.  Don't you agree? 
 Any luck? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Vanessa, Can you determine what this is about? 
 Debra, Do we have any agreements with Sempra which could be used for this long term deal? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes. 
 Richard, This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra. Thank you.    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 01:52 PM 
 Russell, It is time for a master with this counterparty.  Please send the credit sheet to Debra so that she can prepare the master. 
 Gerald, Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient? 
 FEMALE FLYERS  As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, "Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and crew take you safely to your destination."?  Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the captain a woman?"  "Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."  "My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."  "That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the cockpit." 
 Nelson, Please use the above.  Don't forget to add your language in the last paragraph.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Attached please find a clean and redline document reflecting the changes we discussed this morning.  Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/06/2001 07:25 AM 
 Again 
 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no bill of sale is needed.    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 06:49 AM 
 clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 10:58 AM 
 sounds good.    rrrose@aep.com 06/07/2001 12:34 PM 
 Nelson, You are aware that ENA is prohibited from bidding on the Texas volumes for a period of 3 months.  Call me if you need any explanation. 
 Tanya, I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office. The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice. Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature. 
 Dan, I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads "above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, please call and I will modify. 
 Can you add or attach the attachment that you refer to in your note to Jeff Hodge. 
 Barbara, This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have any thoughts. 
 Barry, Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 02:58 PM 
 Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by "fixed price" in the other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 03:27 PM

 Barry, The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please advise. 
 I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to hopefully ignore the long line of traffic trying to get into downtown. 
 No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 234-4204.    Steven Curlee@ENRON 11/06/2000 02:21 PM 
 Barry, Can you elaborate on what you are referring to about AOS daily balancing agreement?  Is this something that Stacy Dickson prepared for you?  If so, please attach a copy for my review.    Barry Tycholiz 11/06/2000 05:01 PM 
 Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.  Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions? 
 Did you get to respond to my voicemail regarding the subject?  If not, please send me credit worksheet.  ASAP 
 Attached please find corrected copies of the subject agreements. 
 Barry, I have attached Stacy's document.  Please advise if you are going to send it out on ENA stationary, or should I direct the Confirm Desk to send it out.    Barry Tycholiz 11/07/2000 01:49 PM 
 Bob, Can you determine from the attached if we have a current deal to amend, or is this simply a new deal under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.?  Please advise. 
 Ellen, We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications after that date.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 11/07/2000 05:12 PM 
 Cheryl, Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document.    Cheryl Dudley 11/08/2000 10:36 AM 
 What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise? 
 Please explain, confirms are sent out by the confirm desk.  why is this sent to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal number is greek.    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 Please send hard copy of deal ticket.  We do not have access.  Otherwise, I think the worksheet is incomplete.  Please complete and include with hard copy of deal ticket.  Has the counterparty requested an Enron Corp guaranty as a condition of doing the deal?    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/08/2000 03:48 PM 
 Kevin, As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.  1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 31, 2000.  2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of the essence in this Agreement..  3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and receive from Seller for such day.  4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any indemnity provision or otherwise.  5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1. Enron North America Corp. P. O. Box 4428 Houston, Texas 77210-4428 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816. 
 Oscar, I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this morning. 
 Gregg, I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant. 
 Russell, I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical guaranty that you currently have from coastal.    Russell Diamond 11/10/2000 02:23 PM 
 Stacy, The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire. 
 The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:  Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.  The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do not have copies of these 2 amendments.  At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe these documents. 
 Ellen, Would you mind responding to Barry regarding these confirms.  Thank you. 
 Ellen, I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2 proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.  If these meet with your approval, let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign. Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section 4.2. 
 I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you know if they get executed. 
 The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach something for me to review?    Kevin Ruscitti 11/13/2000 04:42 PM 
 They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the contract is signed by ENA..    Kevin Ruscitti 11/14/2000 12:01 PM 
 Barbara & Anne, I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, Joe would like as much up front notice as possible. 
 Randy, I have attached a simple release and settlement agreement for you use with the customer.  Please call if you need anything further. 
 Veronica, The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name "Enron North America Corp." in the first paragraph.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 11/14/2000 03:56 PM 
 Now why did you send this to me.  I believe that I was aware that you were out of the office.    Stacy E Dickson 11/15/2000 06:19 PM 
 Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/15/2000 12:39 PM 
 Russell, The guaranty documents are attached.  Please impress upon your contact that we need separate guaranty documents for ena and for hpl.  Call if you need anything further. 
 I could use all four.    Janette Elbertson 11/16/2000 11:48 AM 
 Why couldn't this be done with a new GTC confirm for the extension period? 
 Sounds good, count me in.  I will let you know if anything changes.    Lee L Papayoti 05/01/2001 04:15 PM 
 I forwarded a request to Russell for the credit worksheet on 11/08.  No response to date.  I will forward our master to them once I get the credit worksheet.    Jeffrey T Hodge 11/16/2000 01:24 PM 
 Mike, The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day tomorrow.
