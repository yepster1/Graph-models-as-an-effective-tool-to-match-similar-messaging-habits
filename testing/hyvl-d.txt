 John, I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be provided.    John M Singer@ENRON 03/13/2001 01:49 PM 
 Darren, I left this in my email inbox for some reason.  It is my recollection that we talked about this and I asked you to have them make the changes they were requesting to make to their form and send us a final executed document.  Is that correct?    Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 03/06/2001 12:37 PM 
 Clement, Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience. 
 Chris, The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as our last long term deal except for price? 
 Bobby:  Gary Lamphier requested that I prepare and forward the attached letter for your consideration.  Please call me if you have any questions. 
 My time is my own.  I make efficient use of it, and I still have no time for reading novels.  If you are inquiring about time that I may have been out of the office during the two week period ending today, I was out on Vacation one day, that being March 9, 2001.  Any questions?    Becky Spencer 03/16/2001 11:24 AM 
 My way of thinking.    Becky Spencer 03/19/2001 09:28 AM 
 Perfect image!  How did you loose him? 
 Kim, I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years volume and price.  What is your preference? 
 I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.    Grant Oh 03/19/2001 01:33 PM 
 Grant, The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can discuss.    Grant Oh 03/19/2001 05:16 PM 
 Lee, Here is the Force Majeure letter to Reynolds.  I know nothing about the Union Carbide letter.     Lee L Papayoti 03/20/2001 09:08 AM 
 Texas City Facility - The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking valves, etc.  Clear Lake Facility - The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not. 
 Debra, I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle Klein and to Jared Kaiser . 
 Please review the attached draft letter for Heartland.  Is the letter to be signed by Bradford or someone else? 
 Jared, The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call me and we can discuss.    Jared Kaiser 03/14/2001 02:31 PM 
 Grant, Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm Records.   This to remain     This to be assign- with Crestar.     able by Crestar.    Grant Oh 03/21/2001 03:28 PM 
 Walter, Let's try the above redline out with Gibson. 
 Compansation - options - contact Mary Lessor  35878 Deferred compensation contact Kim Bolton 37084 
 Jim, I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.    Jim Homco 03/22/2001 01:42 PM 
 I am glad to see that you have now acquired a new puppy.    Stacy E Dickson 03/22/2001 02:32 PM 
 Grant, Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries. 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to effectuate such dismissal," 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable. 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest. 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution? 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company. However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above. Dan.    "Kolling, Grant" <grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us> 03/16/2001 05:09 PM 
 Is that the only outstanding item.   If so, okay.  Otherwise, no.    Debra Perlingiere 03/22/2001 01:21 PM 
 Michael,  I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments.  1. Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:  Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office located at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as "Consenting Party")  2. Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for making its own nominations each day.  3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.  Please call if you have any questions.  Dan Hyvl      "Kleiner, Michael" <Michael_Kleiner@gulf.ca> 03/23/2001 03:59 PM 
 Please review the attached Transaction for compliance with your deal.  If additional changes are needed, please advise, otherwise forward to counterparty. 
 Ed, We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all without listing specific types of events which might be considered. You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost. I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call me at (713)853-6895.      Jared Kaiser 10/24/2000 08:42 AM 
 Attached please find the subject agreement for your review.   Please note that certain blanks need to be completed regarding the Customer's status.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713)853-6895. 
 Walter, I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank you.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 03:29 PM 
 Debra, Can you please forward the attached contract to Dave Hutchens.    Jason R Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 03:51 PM 
 Jeff, How would you like me to respond to Linda concerning ENA contracts that are being assigned to HPL as a part of Project TripleLux?

 Please mail or email these to the parties as Jason requested. 
 Kim, The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to include any of the above concepts in the offer.    Kim Ward 03/28/2001 04:02 PM 
 Debra, I had a type in the definition of Material Adverse Change.  Please resend if necessary. 
 Based on Stacy's comments yesterday, I have changed the last sentence of 11.1.  Her comment was that the last sentence of 11.1 said events of force majeure may inclucde and 11.2 said events of force majeure shall include. Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of 11.1. 
 Debra, Here is the new contract.  Please forward by mail and email as requested below. Dan 
 Debra, Here is the new contract.  Please forward by mail and email as requested below. Dan 
 Ellen, I understand from Debra Perlingiere that the Royster-Clark Inc master has been signed.  That being the case, can you generate the appropriate confirm/transaction agreement under that master?    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 03/29/2001 08:53 AM 
 Kim, As we discussed, I am attaching a copy of the last Transaction Agreement that I show has been signed with the City.  Please review and compare it to your current proposal.  We can revisit on Monday and I will then generate a new Transaction Agreement.        Kim Ward 03/29/2001 08:59 AM 
 Michael, I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two changes which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are signing. These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001 and the left over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America Corp.'s address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment Document and have it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the fax numbers for each party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is (713)646-3490.    "Kleiner, Michael" <Michael_Kleiner@gulf.ca> 03/28/2001 05:43 PM 
 Dave, I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return a fully executed original for your files. 
 Sylvia, I have taken Brant Reves comments and incorporated them in the red-line mark-up of the EnergyOne Ventures BAC agreement.  Those changes are reflected in the attached document.  Please review and let me know if you have any further changes which need to be made.  If no additional changes, please forward to counterparty for their comments.   Dan     Sylvia S Pollan 03/27/2001 01:47 PM 
 Ellen, Would you please email me a blank transaction agreement that ena would use to confirm a enron online type transaction.  I need to doctor it and attach to an amendment I am doing with PG&E.  Thank you. 
 Kim, I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions. 1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would suggest that the phrase be deleted. 2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap? 3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified? Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay. Dan    Kim Ward 03/29/2001 03:52 PM 
 Yes,    Debra Perlingiere 10/31/2000 11:30 AM 
 Linda, It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL sale to AEP.    Linda S Bryan 03/27/2001 02:06 PM 
 If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.    David Baumbach 04/02/2001 12:31 PM 
 Deirdre, A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email. Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities (default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language. 
 Janet, Please review the attached to see that it conforms with your deal.  If so, please send an original to the counterparty. 
 Dave, I have attached Exhibit "B" to the above amendment draft.  Please let me know if you need anything further. Dan 
 My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff. Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.     Kim Ward 04/02/2001 05:33 PM 
 Kim, We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association, Inc. (Contract No. 96009607) therefor, the Confirm Desk can do the confirm once it is put in the system.  Ellen, Do you agree?    Kim Ward 04/03/2001 09:40 AM 
 Janet, Please review the attached amendment to see if it sets forth your understanding of the pricing to be applicable with regard to the first volumes to be delivered during the July - June time period.  I assume you want the prices to revert to Index after this period.  Please advise, If okay, please forward to Pat Anderson.      Janet H Wallis 04/03/2001 09:07 AM 
 Janet, I have modified the above as we discussed.  Please check my math. 
 This is good.  I need to try it. 
 City of Brazoria -    ENA contract 96012228 D & H Gas Company, Inc.  ENA contract 96007529 Empire Pipeline Corp.   ENA contract 96000706 Entex Gas Marketing Company  ENA contract 96004593,   This should stay in ENA and a new contract          with Entex Gas Resources Corp. (presently          unsigned) should be assigned to NewCo. Markham Gas Corp.   ENA contract 96003353 Reliant Energy Entex    ENA contract 96002113 Reliant Energy Entex    ENA contract 96004582 Reliant Energy Entex    ENA contract 96004597 Reliant Energy Entex    ENA contract 96019120 Reliant Energy Entex    ENA contract 96031541 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96004236 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96004620 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96016887 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96016888 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96027038 Southern Union Company  ENA contract 96037995 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96001400 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96002962 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96021920 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96026429 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96029165 TXU Fuel Company   ENA contract 96029544 Unit Gas Transmission Company, Inc. ENA contract 96002879  I will continue to work to make sure these are the only contracts and if I find any new agreements, I will supplement the list. 
 Dave, As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by Enron.    "Anderson, David W (Law)" <DWA3@pge.com> 04/03/2001 01:54 PM 
 Please send the executed amendments to me at the below address and I will have them signed and return one original to your attention.: Daniel J. Hyvl P. O. Box 1188, Suite 3878 Houston, Texas 77251-1188    "Anderson, David W (Law)" <DWA3@pge.com> 04/03/2001 05:43 PM 
 Okay with me.    Debra Perlingiere 04/03/2001 11:56 AM 
 Gary, Please review the attached confirms.  if the appear in order, please send to the counterparty. 
 Grant, I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a fully executed contract for your files. Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties. Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I can verify with the transport group.

 Grant, One last change,  Kim Ward agreed to reduce the penalty provisions in 3.2 and 3.4 from $0.15 to $0.015.  The rest of the contract was unchanged.  As stated in previous email, please forward two signed originals to me for Enron's further handling. 
 Please review the new added language to see if this is what you have agreed to do. 
 Subject: Re: T-shirt Give Away 
 Ruth, Please review to verify that I have included all of your changes.  I believe that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to deliver to you originals on ENA stationary. 
 Grant, Do you want to forward it to Bruce for his reaction?    Grant Oh 04/06/2001 02:40 PM 
 You really didn't have to rub the age bit in.  I know that I am still too young.  Saw Mom yesterday.  Will try to get back Sunday, but can't say for sure.  See you there if I can make it.  Write sometimes. 
 Currently Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday are open.  Let me know when and where the Meeting will be.    Karen Gruesen/ENRON@enronXgate 04/08/2001 09:12 AM 
 The attached confirmations - Firm GTCs have been signed by both Smurfit and Enron.  Please call if you need me to make a copy for you. 
 Grant, Bruce called to say the language is okay.  Hunter also confirmed the language.  Please print out the attached confirms and forward them to Crestar.  Hopefully this is the last time.

 I thought that we were each faxing our signature pages.  I sent Enron's earlier, however, I have yet to receive any signature pages from the other entities.  Please fax to Dan Hyvl at (713) 646-3490.    "Voinorosky, Michelle L" <voinorml@bp.com> 04/09/2001 11:49 AM 
 Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them? 
 Can you answer? 
 Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and forwarding to Gibson. 
 Walter, Tammi is the attorney at Gibson.  She has not responed to my email.  You may want to talk with your contact to see if everything is in order.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 04:18 PM 
 Walter, where you intending to send this to me or to Clement Abrams?    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 04:02 PM 
 Me.  I will review the attached.     Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 04:52 PM 
 Walter, Please print the clean copy and have it signed and forward two originals to Gibson. 
 Linda, Try the transport group, Steve VanHooser, Gerald Nemec, Eric Gillaspie, and maybe Shonnie Daniel.  I did not assign any transport contracts, especially from HPl to ENA.    Linda S Bryan 04/11/2001 07:56 AM 
 Walter, I notice that this is to cover the swap agreements.  Has  the swap approved the form of guaranty, if not, please forward to them for their approval.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 04:02 PM 
 Is this to be in replacement of the amendment I previously drafted or in addition to the volumes on that amendment?    Janet H Wallis/ENRON@enronXgate 04/11/2001 11:07 AM 
 Please review the attached Transaction Agreement to see if I have correctly captured the terms. 
 Becky Spencer 04/11/2001 11:20 AM 
 Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.

 Don't you want to sign up as a contestant on this show? - Subject: Survivor  CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning "Survivor, Texas Style."  The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio, on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.  Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."  The first one to make it back to Dallas wins. 
 I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised). 2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001 and 2001-023acrfm covers the firm sale of 0 -11,740 MMBtu per day, also for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001.  By assignment agreement (Crestar assignment.doc attached) dated effective as of April 1, 2001, Crestar assigned 2001-023acrfm to BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp. Ellen Wallumrod has requested that documentation be provided to her to enable her to rebook the portion documented by 2001-023acrfm for the period 4/01/01 - 10/31/01 as a result of the assignment.  Please provide Ellen with the necessary paperwork or forward to the party who needs to provide her with the necessary paperwork. 
 Janet, Please review the attached to verify that I have made all of the changes. Thank you. 
 Mark, Please review the attachments from Phil DeMoes and let me know if this is something similar to what you have been doing for ENA at other locations.  If so, can you let Phil know what you think about the attachments. 
 Ellen, I have generated the attached for Kim Ward.  I will let you know if the counterparty elects to sign.     Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 04/03/2001 11:16 AM 
 Kim, Stacy (Dickson) Granmayeh has reviewed the proposed Master Contract that y= ou=20 drafted for enovate, L.L.C. and I have likewise reviewed the proposed Maste= r=20 Contract that you forwarded to Enron North America Corp.  As I indicated earlier, these contracts are similar to the contract we=20 started with last year in documenting the transaction that was ultimately= =20 entered into.  I recall providing a copy of our Sample Enfolio Master Firm= =20 Purchase/Sale Agreement together with the credit departments requirements= =20 which they required in order to enter into the transaction.  I am told that= =20 those credit requirements relating to triggering events and collateral=20 threshold will also be necessary before Enron North America Corp. can enter= =20 into a transaction this year.  Unless I specifically state that a comment relates to enovate or to Enron,= =20 these comments relate to both entities.  1. The correct name for enovate is:  enovate, L.L.C.  2. Change the Confirming Party in Section 3.12 to Seller.  3. Section 4.1 needs to be altered in such a way to make the verbal=20 agreement of the Parties binding at the time of the phone call.  As written= ,=20 any agreement between the Parties is not binding until a Transaction=20 Confirmation is executed by both Parties.  4. The word "Contract" in Section 5.1.1.b. should be changed to=20 "Transaction".  5. The concept of "Point(s) of Receipt" and "Point(s) of Sale" need to be= =20 collapsed into Point(s) of Delivery at which point title and possession is= =20 transferred from the Seller to the Buyer. No need for two separate concepts= .  6. Delete Sections 6.5 and 6.6 in their entireties.  7. Alter Section 8.3.3 concerning Locked Prices in such a way to make the= =20 Locked Prices binding at the time of the phone call; not upon the passage o= f=20 48 hours for receipt of confirmation.  8. The term "Commodity Charge Index Adjustment" used in Section 8.1, 8.2 a= nd=20 8.3 needs to be defined.  9. The first sentence of Section 10.3 should be altered to delete the last= =20 phrase =01&of the negligence of the other Party=018 and include the followi= ng=20 phrase in its place:  =01&the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad f= aith=20 of the other Party.=018 =20 10. Delete the phrase =01&(not via facsimile)=018 from the first sentence = of=20 Section 12.1.  11. Add the following phrase at the end of Section 15.3: =01&; the loss of= =20 Buyer=01,s Markets; or Buyer=01,s inability economically to use or resell g= as=20 purchased hereunder.=018  12. Delete the phrase =01&or Buyer or Seller claims force majeure for a pe= riod=20 exceeding seven (7) cumulative days or five (5) consecutive days during the= =20 Transaction Term=018 in Section 16.1.b.  13. Add the following sentence to the end of Section 16.1.e:  =01&Party fa= ils=20 to perform any covenant set forth in this Contract.=018  14. Delete the third sentence of Section 16.2 in its entirety.  15. Delete Section 16.3.d in its entirety.  16. The Corporate Guarantee in Section 19 should be a payment guarantee no= t=20 a performance guarantee.  17. With regard to enovate, change =01&Wisconsin=018 to =01&Illinois=018 i= n Section=20 21.5; and with regard to Enron, change "Wisconsin" to "Texas" in Section 21= .5.  18. Section 21.7 requires =01&mutual execution of an appropriate supplemen= tal=20 written Transaction Confirmation=018 for an effective modification.  This= =20 conflicts with Section 8.3.3, which does not require execution of a=20 Transaction Confirmation for a Locked Price.  19. Delete Section 22.e in its entirety.  20. In Exhibit A, delete Section 12, Regulatory Contingency, in its entire= ty.  Please review the foregoing and provide revised contracts to both enovate= =20 and Enron for further review in accordance with the foregoing matters. 
 Phil, I forwarded your email concerning enermetrix to mark greenberg, who is our inhouse expert on these type transactions.  Please call him for his read of their document.    Phil DeMoes@ENRON 04/16/2001 11:19 AM 
 Please review the revised representations and warranties language. If acceptable, please print 2 copies, sign and forward to Janet Wallis at Enron for execution by Enron and return of one fully executed copy.     "Pfister, Christian W." <CWPfister@cps-satx.com> 10/30/2000 12:18 PM 
 Phil, I have reviewed the confirmation letter and have made several small changes.  I believe that I sent you hard copies, however, if you don't receive them, please print two of the attached. 
 darren, This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you agree?

 Please review the foregoing and let me know if there need to be any changes. Thank you.

 This is being resent because of an addressing error which caused the original message to fail. 
 Charlie, Please review the attached letter agreement to see if it conforms with your understanding of the processing arrangement that you intend to have with Hunt.  If so let me know and I will remove the red-lining. 
 Ellen, Okay to send GTC confirm with attached GTC terms; however, please delete the conflicting price on the attachment.  the attachment should be Month and Monthly Volume.  Delete Price from attachment.  Don't you agree?    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 04/18/2001 09:23 AM 
 Joan, Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if you have any questions. 
 Anthony, Why GTC.  We have a new master that is in the system thay was signed within the last 3 weeks.  Put the transaction under the new master.  Any questions, call me!!!!

 Charlie, I have modified both documents based on Joan's comments.  I trust that you will get them distributed to the proper parties. 
 April 11, 2001    Jason R Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 04/18/2001 12:52 PM 
 Phil, Attached please find the first draft of the proposed confidentiality agreement between ena and midcoast.  Please read paragraph 7 together with the definition of Proposed Transaction in the first paragraph to determine if you think the language is sufficient to cover us. 
 Forwarded as requested.  I will check with Gary regarding the status.  At the time that I sent this I was informed that they were ready to sign. 
 Russell, Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further negotiation later today.  Lee, Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the "as is, where is" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company. Anything else?  . 
 Forwarded as we discussed.  Likewise, I will check with Gary regarding the status. 
 Wayne, I have modified the above contract as we discussed.  The "Customer's Agent" language is contained in Appendix "1".  Please have the contract signed by JER Partners, a J.E. Robert Company and fax it back to me.  I will then have it signed by Houston Pipe Line Company.  I have left the attachment at the end as originally drafted until I am able to talk to Gary Lamphier.  If it is truly correct that there are no minimum quantity obligations under the deal, then Gary may have to reprice the $0.09 discount for the 1000/d.  I will leave that up to Gary and you to resolve. 
 A jeweler watched as a huge truck pulled up in front of his store. The back came down and an elephant walked out. It broke one of the windows with its tusk and then, using its trunk like a vacuum cleaner sucked up all of the jewelry. The elephant then got back in the truck and it disappeared out of sight.  When the jeweler finally regained his senses he called the police. The detectives came and he told them his story.  "Could you describe the elephant?" the cop asked.  "An elephant is an elephant," he replied. "You've seen one you've seen them all. What do you mean 'describe' him?"  "Well," said the policeman, "there are two types of elephants, African and Indian. The Indian elephant has smaller ears and is not as large as the African elephant."  "I can't help you out," said the frustrated jeweler, "he had a stocking pulled over his head." 
 Walter, The document is okay if you put it on ENA letterhead, and add the counterparty's name in the blank in the signature area.  Please call if you need anything futher.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/19/2001 11:43 AM 
 Sounds good, ask Stacy.    Jenny Helton 04/20/2001 09:34 AM 
 The attached transaction agreement has been signed by the customer on 4-16-01. We have a faxed copy.  I will send you the faxed copy for your files.  Call if you have any questions. 
 Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in all next week if we need to further tweak the language. 
 Dave, I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract. Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components is proceeding.    Dave Fuller 10/18/2000 04:43 PM 
 Teresa, I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.    Teresa G Bushman 04/19/2001 05:45 PM 
 Grant, I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area. My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me so that we can discuss. 
 Okay.  comments noted below.    Becky Spencer 04/23/2001 09:00 AM 
 Teresa, I think that the problem is what is meant by "these costs".  Currently we think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may be different with regard to next months deal.  Please advise.    Teresa G Bushman 04/24/2001 09:41 AM 
 Becky Spencer 04/24/2001 10:21 AM 
 Note that the previous contract is terminated 8/31/02 in the new agreement and the new confirm is attached at the end of the new agreement.  Any comments???    Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 04/24/2001 03:02 PM 
 Okay, Stacy and you can go tommorrow, I cannot make it.   Maybe you can ask Jeff to drive you and Stacy tommorrow.   The only time I have next week is Monday.    Jenny Helton 04/25/2001 12:59 PM 
 Darren, There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you request changes to that deal.    Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 04/25/2001 11:53 AM 
 All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates. The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be in the contract file.  Do you agree?    Irene Flynn 10/27/2000 02:49 PM 
 Ellen, The attached document at the end of this is the final except for the minor change which we discussed. 
 As we discussed.    Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 04:02 PM

 Health Tips and News The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:  Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true? A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.  Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables? A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop.  Q: Is beer or wine bad for me? A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories= : animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.  Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio? A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.  Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench press. What did he mean? A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin= d that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t= o reevaluate your exercise program.  Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis= e program? A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No Pain.  Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer? A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.  Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you? A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you?  Q: What's the secret to healthy eating? A: Thicker gravy.  Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle? A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul= d only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.  =7F <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Shawn Shafai IT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management Cisco Systems, Inc.

 Janie, Please send a GTC Confirm out on this buyback deal.  It only has a one month duration.  Please call if you have any questions.    Janie Aguayo 04/27/2001 03:39 PM 
 Not my deal...... 
 Dave, I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I have a number of questions. 1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB. 2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for such non scheduled excess volumes? Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the transaction agreement.    Dave Fuller 04/29/2001 12:14 PM 
 Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back please.

 Barbara, According to the Restructuring of Gas Purchase and Sales Contracts between ENA and Entex, Entex is to purchase their natural gas requirements for General Service Customers from ENA except for (i) approximately 30 Bcf per year to be purchased from other suppliers at points other than Conroe; (ii) gas currently purchased from 2 other suppliers at Conroe; (iii) 10,000 MMBtu of gas per day purchased from a third party during the period 4/1/99-3/31/2002; (iv) volumes Entex purchases from HPL under 2/8/76 gas supply agreement; (v) 6,000 MMBtu  per day Entex currently transports on HPL under 1991 transportation agreement.

 Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of showing changes. 
 A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone. Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!" All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her. She committed suicide!" 
 If furtherance to my above reply, EFI and EPOS should not be EOL parties, at least not under the Dominion Republic and Guatemala agreements.    Leslie Hansen 11/01/2000 10:29 AM 
 Phil DeMoes asked me to forward this document for your review. 
 Troy, I have modified the agreement and have forwarded to you the final version which we and they should sign. 
 Gary, The final version is attached for you to send to the customer and have them sign and return 2 originals to HPL.  We can then sign and give them one original. 
 Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it is now your watch.  The only thing that might occur is Mark Breese.  I have placed a voice mail to him in response to his Detroit rfp but he is out.  The deal should be okay assuming Mark can make the prices work.  Anyway, I will handle with Mark.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  I will be back Friday to resume the watch.  See ya! 
 Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me know.  I don't know how many are going to show and eat.  I will leave the beans, potato salad, chips and desserts to you and Bettye.

 Michael, Please note that the footer is wrong on the 1999 MTBE doc.  It should be 98002gctr.doc instead of 98002fctr.doc. Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Ellen, Attached please find a GTC confirm that I prepared for the requested deal done by Janet Wallis.  Please call if you have any questions.  I have asked Janet to forward to New Gulf if the GTC correctly reflects her transaction. I will notify you if there are any changes. 
 Thank you.  Phil made me promise to ask. 
 Jeff, We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the case? Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for a career opportunity with HPL. 
 Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream. The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved through arbitration.  Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to Upstream. 
 Kim, Please review and if okay please send out for signature.  Thank you. 
 I agree with the corrected amount.  Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Spell check doesn't work on numbers or capitals.    Megan Parker@ENRON 05/17/2001 01:10 PM 
 Janet, The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.       Janet H Wallis/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 10:38 AM 
 Cheryl, I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group has already indicated that they did not have it.    Cheryl Dudley 05/17/2001 04:20 PM 
 Stacey, I am sorry that you got involved.  The HPL group had already indicated that they did not have the documents. 
 I intend to be out every other Wednesday plus a few other dates.  Jeff's traveling schedule has messed up my plans for next Monday.  Now I am trying to reshuffle and will get you my plans as soon as I can communicate with Jeff after he returns from his European travels. 
 Janet, Here is a red line of the changes we discussed.  If you agree, let me know what you want next with this deal. 
 Attached is a memo of the major items in their comments to our requested changes.  Let me know when you are ready to discuss. 
 Brant, EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan. 
 Why are you sending this to me?  Shouldn't it have been the GISB which you are modifying as we discussed Friday?    Debra Perlingiere 05/21/2001 09:50 AM 
 Looks okay to send to counterparty for signature.  Please send.    Debra Perlingiere 05/21/2001 03:09 PM 
 Please review my first draft.  I still need to add language to properly reflect the indices being used. Please forward to my any changes that you may desire or that may be needed.

 Okay, I think, can you red line against the previous wording? 
 I checked, it is okay. 
 In case I forgot to send you a copy. 
 Troy, It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things don't happen.    Troy Black/ENRON@enronXgate 05/22/2001 10:50 AM 
 Richard, Please change the last paragraph of the Confirmation to provide that it must be signed by each party and provide signature lines for both parties.    Richard Deming@ENRON 05/23/2001 05:05 PM 
 I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise. 
 THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER  A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.  The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?" 
 Lee, Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in structuring the transaction in this manner.       Lee L Papayoti 05/23/2001 03:54 PM

 Lisa, Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of guarantees provided by the credit group.

Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895. 
 Attached please find the revised Spot Confirmation that needs to be sent by fax to each of the counterparties named in the Spot Confirmation.  I have added language requiring them to sign and return by fax a copy of their acceptance to the deal terms.  Please attach the GTC Spot terms to the Spot Confirm when it is sent out.  Also, please let Russell Diamond know when this is sent out and whether we get their faxed signature back.

 Mike,  In response to your voice mail, yes the change from Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. (ECTR) to Enron North America Corp. (ENA) was a name change.  The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for General Service Customers - Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions dated effective as of April 1, 1999 between ECTR and Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. is 96019120.  The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for Large Commercial and Industrial Consumers dated effective as of May 1, 1995 between ECTR (assignee of HPL Resources Company) and Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. is 96004582.

 Robert, Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.    Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:21 PM

 Cathy, At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, I would approve them for execution. Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services. No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request forms. 
 I was not out any days during this period. 
 FYI 
 Keith Ford with TXU Fuel Company confirmed to me this morning that TXU had agreed to consent to the assignment of the contracts and that he would fax the signed consent to me as soon as he could get an officer to sign same.  He agreed to send me a letter to that affect in the event he was unable to get a signature today. 
 Candace, If you look at your purchase document, you will see that you never received the minerals.  Do you agree?    Candace L Bywaters 05/31/2001 09:14 AM 
 Chris, Anne Koehler asked me to email the attached red-line assignment to you for her review and revision.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is (713) 853-6895. 
 Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke documents for you to print off and have signed. 
 Here's the duke documents. 
 Robert, My fax number is 713-646-3490.    Robert Rose@ENRON 05/31/2001 03:57 PM 
 Ellen, This should be okay.  I would prefer that all GTCs in excess of 6 months be prepared for signature by both ENA and the counterparty.  Is this a problem? 
 Richard, Please fix the confirm so that it shows signature to be provided by both ENA and the Counterparty.    Richard Deming@ENRON 05/23/2001 05:05 PM 
 THE STRONGEST MAN  Ted walks into a bar and shouts out, "Who's the strongest person in here?"  The toughest guy looks at him and says, "I am the strongest person around these parts!"  Ted politely asks, "Can you help me push my car to the gas station?"    HE SAID/SHE SAID  He said... I don't know why you wear a bra;  you've got nothing to put in it. She said...You wear briefs, don't you?  He said....Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune? She said...Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the money.  She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk? He said....It's not my fault...I ran out of money.  He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in the worst way. She said...Well, you succeeded.  He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you? She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror.  He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight. She said...Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.  He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm? She said...I would, but you're never there.  He said....Shall we try a different position tonight? She said...That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on the sofa and fart." 
 As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call me if you need anything further regarding this matter. 
 Again, "I accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement."  Please acknowledge receipt of this.  Thank you. 
 I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois. This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed. 
 Sorry about that, I am guilty of coping the address info from prior memos.  I will update my memos.  Is the last one a Hunt Oil Company processing rights letter?  That was the last item i transmitted.    Stacey Richardson 06/01/2001 02:58 PM 
 Have you had any luck in finding Ann Elizabeth's form? 
 Becky, I honestly do not remember this one.  Cannot rate.    Becky Spencer 06/04/2001 07:58 AM 
 Cathy, I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.    caszasz@aep.com 06/01/2001 03:31 PM 
 Stacy, Please let them know that they are using the wrong assignment list.  Remind them that the list was changing as late as noon Friday.  They need to check the final list.  They can get that from George Weismann.    Stacy E Dickson 06/04/2001 09:04 AM 
 Richard, Please use the attached.  I have continued Credit's requirement which they required for the January 22, 2001 confirm.     Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 11:29 AM 
 Richard, Please set it up for each party to sign.  Signature for a 18 month deal is mandatory.  Has credit approved the deal?    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 12:02 PM 
 Please look over the attached document?  If okay, please complete and send.     Steve HPL Schneider 06/01/2001 03:33 PM

 Lee, I have removed the collateral requirements from this document because we have blanket security request rights in the base contract.  Don't you agree? 
 Any luck? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Vanessa, Can you determine what this is about? 
 Debra, Do we have any agreements with Sempra which could be used for this long term deal? 
 Candace, Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the property being sold? 
 Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes. 
 Richard, This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra. Thank you.    Richard Deming@ENRON 06/04/2001 01:52 PM 
 Russell, It is time for a master with this counterparty.  Please send the credit sheet to Debra so that she can prepare the master. 
 Gerald, Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient? 
 FEMALE FLYERS  As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, "Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and crew take you safely to your destination."?  Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the captain a woman?"  "Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."  "My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."  "That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the cockpit." 
 Nelson, Please use the above.  Don't forget to add your language in the last paragraph.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Attached please find a clean and redline document reflecting the changes we discussed this morning.  Please let me know if you need anything further. 
 Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/06/2001 07:25 AM 
 Again 
 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no bill of sale is needed.    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 06:49 AM 
 clbywaters1@aep.com 06/07/2001 10:58 AM 
 sounds good.    rrrose@aep.com 06/07/2001 12:34 PM 
 Nelson, You are aware that ENA is prohibited from bidding on the Texas volumes for a period of 3 months.  Call me if you need any explanation. 
 Tanya, I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office. The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice. Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature. 
 Dan, I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads "above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, please call and I will modify. 
 Can you add or attach the attachment that you refer to in your note to Jeff Hodge. 
 Barbara, This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have any thoughts. 
 Barry, Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 02:58 PM 
 Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by "fixed price" in the other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price?    Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 03:27 PM

 Barry, The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please advise. 
 I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to hopefully ignore the long line of traffic trying to get into downtown. 
 No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 234-4204.    Steven Curlee@ENRON 11/06/2000 02:21 PM 
 Barry, Can you elaborate on what you are referring to about AOS daily balancing agreement?  Is this something that Stacy Dickson prepared for you?  If so, please attach a copy for my review.    Barry Tycholiz 11/06/2000 05:01 PM 
 Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.  Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions? 
 Did you get to respond to my voicemail regarding the subject?  If not, please send me credit worksheet.  ASAP 
 Attached please find corrected copies of the subject agreements. 
 Barry, I have attached Stacy's document.  Please advise if you are going to send it out on ENA stationary, or should I direct the Confirm Desk to send it out.    Barry Tycholiz 11/07/2000 01:49 PM 
 Bob, Can you determine from the attached if we have a current deal to amend, or is this simply a new deal under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.?  Please advise. 
 Ellen, We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications after that date.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 11/07/2000 05:12 PM 
 Cheryl, Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document.    Cheryl Dudley 11/08/2000 10:36 AM 
 What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise? 
 Please explain, confirms are sent out by the confirm desk.  why is this sent to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal number is greek.    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 Please send hard copy of deal ticket.  We do not have access.  Otherwise, I think the worksheet is incomplete.  Please complete and include with hard copy of deal ticket.  Has the counterparty requested an Enron Corp guaranty as a condition of doing the deal?    Jason R Williams@ENRON 11/08/2000 03:48 PM 
 Kevin, As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.  1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 31, 2000.  2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of the essence in this Agreement..  3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and receive from Seller for such day.  4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any indemnity provision or otherwise.  5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1. Enron North America Corp. P. O. Box 4428 Houston, Texas 77210-4428 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816. 
 Oscar, I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this morning. 
 Gregg, I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant. 
 Russell, I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical guaranty that you currently have from coastal.    Russell Diamond 11/10/2000 02:23 PM 
 Stacy, The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire. 
 The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:  Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.  The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do not have copies of these 2 amendments.  At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe these documents. 
 Ellen, Would you mind responding to Barry regarding these confirms.  Thank you. 
 Ellen, I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2 proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.  If these meet with your approval, let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign. Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section 4.2. 
 I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you know if they get executed. 
 The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach something for me to review?    Kevin Ruscitti 11/13/2000 04:42 PM 
 They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the contract is signed by ENA..    Kevin Ruscitti 11/14/2000 12:01 PM 
 Barbara & Anne, I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, Joe would like as much up front notice as possible. 
 Randy, I have attached a simple release and settlement agreement for you use with the customer.  Please call if you need anything further. 
 Veronica, The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name "Enron North America Corp." in the first paragraph.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 11/14/2000 03:56 PM 
 Now why did you send this to me.  I believe that I was aware that you were out of the office.    Stacy E Dickson 11/15/2000 06:19 PM 
 Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/15/2000 12:39 PM 
 Russell, The guaranty documents are attached.  Please impress upon your contact that we need separate guaranty documents for ena and for hpl.  Call if you need anything further. 
 I could use all four.    Janette Elbertson 11/16/2000 11:48 AM 
 Why couldn't this be done with a new GTC confirm for the extension period? 
 Sounds good, count me in.  I will let you know if anything changes.    Lee L Papayoti 05/01/2001 04:15 PM 
 I forwarded a request to Russell for the credit worksheet on 11/08.  No response to date.  I will forward our master to them once I get the credit worksheet.    Jeffrey T Hodge 11/16/2000 01:24 PM 
 Mike, The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day tomorrow.
