tc., after we decide how ENA also wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.    Sandi M Braband 03/07/2001 09:30 AM 
 A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

 THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME submitted by MeanBabaJean  This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old buddies, so he says to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right back..."?  "Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?" asked the wife.?  "I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer."?  The wife says to him, "You want a beer my love?" Then she opens the door to the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.?  The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of saying is, "Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass..."?  He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by saying,"You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?" She takes a mug out of the freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.?  The husband, looking a bit pale, says, "Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"?  "You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?" She opens the oven and takes out 15 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.?  "But Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the swearing, the dirty words and all that. .."?  "You want dirty words Cutie Pie?..HERE, DRINK YOUR F*****G BEER IN YOUR FROZEN F*****G MUG AND EAT YOUR F*****G SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE! GOT IT A*****E?!!"   Subject: FW: Fw: HER BALLONS    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless. "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well, son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation and goes off quite satisfied. Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the kitchen. "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both of her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps yelling, "God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!" 
 Jan, Can you let Christian know that I will not be in the office on Friday. Please have him download the substance of the call to me next Monday.  I will check my voice mail tommorrow if he needs to talk to me.    Jan M King 03/08/2001 03:38 PM 
 Grant, I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items: 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT". 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the contract would be executed by the City. 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall". 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an omission. 5. I have added the word "reasonable". 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure. 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure. 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any month. 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA. 10. I have changed "a" to "the" 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure. 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written. 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in using language that had been provided by the City. 14. I added the word "reasonable". 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP. 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% over prime language. 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating. 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know that before we execute the Contract. 19. I have added the word "reasonable". 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract. 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer. 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Contract.  I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you care to discuss any of these matters.    "Kolling, Grant" <grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us> 03/02/2001 03:43 PM 
 THE GIFT OF LIFE submitted by Amber Tozer  On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 50 years."  The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So God agreed.  On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."  The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.  On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."  The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks? Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agreed.  On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life span."  The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing? Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agreed.  AND THAT'S WHY.... In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, sit by the front door and bark at people! 
 Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage. 
 Okay.    Stacy E Dickson 03/12/2001 01:29 PM 
 Kim, Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show them what we got for the default quantity. 
 Kim, What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit requirements into the standard agreement? I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc. Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not signed, no agreement. Let's discuss where we go from here.    Kim Ward 03/12/2001 05:17 PM 
 yes.    Becky Spencer 03/13/2001 08:47 AM 
 Michael,  Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.  1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company. I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).  2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.  3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you requested. 
 Michael, Hopefully I have fixed the page number on the header label in the attached. 
 Janet, I have changed the attached for ENA.  Please let me know if you need anything further.      Janet H Wallis 03/09/2001 10:58 AM 
 Mark, I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff.  If the contract is acceptable, please print off 2 originals and have them signed and forward to Jeff for signature by ENA.  Once the contract is finally executed, Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files.   - 
 Susan, That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with Coral.    Susan Elledge@ENRON 03/13/2001 01:48 PM 
 Ed, I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign. Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the contract be done in ENA's name. 
 Kim, The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as attached.    Kim Ward 03/13/2001 05:54 PM 
 Travis, Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to trade on Enron Online. Please let me know if you need anything further.      Travis McCullough 03/13/2001 07:25 PM

 Please generate a GISB for Jared using the attached.  Let's discuss their addendum.  I don't think we will use it.  Let's get a copy of our current interruptible agreement so that we can see what has been previously agreed to. 
 Kim, Is the attached what you intended for me to review?    Kim Ward 03/14/2001 03:18 PM 
 Kim, The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California. The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company. The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these assets for them.  Repricing should work.  Call me if you have any further questions.    Kim Ward 03/14/2001 04:09 PM 
 You need to save this joke for use with the new Enron password requirements.    Becky Spencer 03/14/2001 05:17 PM 
 John, I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be provided.    John M Singer@ENRON 03/13/2001 01:49 PM 
 Darren, I left this in my email inbox for some reason.  It is my recollection that we talked about this and I asked you to have them make the changes they were requesting to make to their form and send us a final executed document.  Is that correct?    Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 03/06/2001 12:37 PM 
 Clement, Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience. 
 Chris, The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as our last long term deal except for price? 
 Bobby:  Gary Lamphier requested that I prepare and forward the attached letter for your consideration.  Please call me if you have any questions. 
 My time is my own.  I make efficient use of it, and I still have no time for reading novels.  If you are inquiring about time that I may have been out of the office during the two week period ending today, I was out on Vacation one day, that being March 9, 2001.  Any questions?    Becky Spencer 03/16/2001 11:24 AM 
 My way of thinking.    Becky Spencer 03/19/2001 09:28 AM 
 Perfect image!  How did you loose him? 
 Kim, I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years volume and price.  What is your preference? 
 I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.    Grant Oh 03/19/2001 01:33 PM 
 Grant, The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can discuss.    Grant Oh 03/19/2001 05:16 PM 
 Lee, Here is the Force Majeure letter to Reynolds.  I know nothing about the Union Carbide letter.     Lee L Papayoti 03/20/2001 09:08 AM 
 Texas City Facility - The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking valves, etc.  Clear Lake Facility - The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not. 
 Debra, I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle Klein and to Jared Kaiser . 
 Please review the attached draft letter for Heartland.  Is the letter to be signed by Bradford or someone else? 
 Jared, The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call me and we can discuss.    Jared Kaiser 03/14/2001 02:31 PM 
 Grant, Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm Records.   This to remain     This to be assign- with Crestar.     able by Crestar.    Grant Oh 03/21/2001 03:28 PM

 Jim, I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.    Jim Homco 03/22/2001 01:42 PM 
 I am glad to see that you have now acquired a new puppy.    Stacy E Dickson 03/22/2001 02:32 PM 
 Grant, Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries. 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to effectuate such dismissal," 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable. 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest. 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution? 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company. However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above. Dan.    "Kolling, Grant" <grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us> 03/16/2001 05:09 PM 
 Is that the only outstanding item.   If so, okay.  Otherwise, no.    Debra Perlingiere 03/22/2001 01:21 PM 
 Michael,  I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments.  1. Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:  Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office located at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as "Consenting Party")  2. Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for making its own nominations each day.  3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.  Please call if you have any questions.  Dan Hyvl      "Kleiner, Michael" <Michael_Kleiner@gulf.ca> 03/23/2001 03:59 PM 
 Please review the attached Transaction for compliance with your deal.  If additional changes are needed, please advise, otherwise forward to counterparty. 
 Ed, We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all without listing specific types of events which might be considered. You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost. I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call me at (713)853-6895.      Jared Kaiser 10/24/2000 08:42 AM 
 Attached please find the subject agreement for your review.   Please note that certain blanks need to be completed regarding the Customer's status.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713)853-6895. 
 Walter, I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.
