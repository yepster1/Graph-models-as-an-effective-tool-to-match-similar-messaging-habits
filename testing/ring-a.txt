please check with Beverly.  Thank You! 
 Hi!  The sitara deal # is 527410.  Hope this helps! 
 Elizabeth,  Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct and this is not a large amount in question.   Thank You! 
 Sorry,   I changed the deal ticket to $10.50.    Thank You! 
 Thanks Victor! 
 Hi!  You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas! 
 To all,  If you would like to contribute towards a gift for Scott Neal and/or Kimberly Brown, please drop your contribution by my desk.  Would like to collect $20 for each but any amount would be appreciated.  I will take a check and would like to receive by Tuesday!  Thanks in advance! 
 Hi!  These sales to Torch are valid.  Accounting is going to correct.  If you do not see this happen soon - please let me know.    Thank You! 
 Hi!  Are we still on for dinner? 
 Hi!  Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long to get  back to you! 
 Hi!  I gave his resume to Scott Neal.  He is going to look at it and pass it on to the appropriate people.  It looks like his backround includes more origination experience than trading.   Take care! 
 Thanks for the invite but we already have plans for the game.   Hope you have a good time and Nebraska wins! 
 Hi!  It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron. I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday season!  Take care!   Andy 
 This will make your day! 
 I think the kids would like this! 
 Thought you might like to see this! 
 Hi!  Sandra Brawner trades the Gas Daily Finantial products for the Gulf Coast.  She will be on vacation tomorrow and has asked me to run these products for her.  I need to be able to manage these products.  I can already manage the Henry Hub (Griff Gray set this up for me).  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help! 
 Hopefully this will cheer you ( just a little)! 
 Maybe this will help cheer you up - I know how much you love cats!
