 I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them. 
 Sherlyn, I didn't send you a note, but please call me and I can explain these to you.  (303) 575-6485  Thanks, Theresa 
 Jeff, Attached is my resume.  I can probably be reached best on my cell phone (303) 807-6131 or at work (303) 575-6485.  Thanks again for thinking of me.  Theresa 
 Mark, I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Mark, Susan said to go ahead and expense the cell phones.  I called AT&T and it was 176.92  so I put it on my credit card and I'll turn it in.  The phones should be on now. 
 This new counterparty is the old "KN Gas Services" counterparty.  They just changed their name A contact would be Lori Leyda at (303) 914-4914  Thanks. Theresa 
 Was our purchase tied to this wire your accounting group received? 
 Real Funny! 
 Alan, I'm not sure that our purchase is equivalent to the $1.55 purchase but I assumed you received an e-mail from Amy Felling in our office.  Here's the September purchase for September.  Let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Ladies, Here's the revised September purchase.  Thank you Cheryl for bringing this to my attention!  Sorry about the mix-up.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Mom, That's sounds fine to me.  Would they go horse back riding that day or a different day?  Where they live will there be things for the kids to do?  It sounds like they have a lot of kids around so there should be things for them to do.  I talked to Jan this morning about a bigger cabin and the 10 person one is the biggest one.  She called and reserved another 4 person one for $100.  I'm gonna call Tim and let him know that he and Dawn can have that one.  I'll call you at work too  because I'm never sure if you get these e-mails from me.  Theresa 
 Carole, We have a conference call at 11:10 your time (ten minutes).  As soon as we are done - we'll give you a call.  Thanks, Theresa 
 I'm not sure if they are issuing any wires at this time.  I will try and find out. 
 Gloria, Amy Felling here is working on current month and I'll continue on prior month variances.  We'll let you know the status of current month by tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks, Theresa 
 I'm glad.  I'm very sorry about that mix up.  Than
