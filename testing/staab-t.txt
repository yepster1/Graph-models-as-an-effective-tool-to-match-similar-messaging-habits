e to wait until Nicole calls me back to see who she wants to trade for.  If she calls me yet today, I'll let you know. 
 Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no reason.  We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush us.  We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.  And by the way - where's our $60????? 
 Let me consult my partner and get back with you in the morning. 
 What's your idea? 
 FYI  Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.   That's all I have to say .....about that.  Theresa 
 Kelly, I'm gonna be early this week.(for once)  I'll take Dallas as my loser this week.  Talk to you later. Theresa 
 Can you try this again? Thanks. 
 Bob, I'll take Oakland as my winner this week.  I gave Lucci my $20.  Theresa Staab 
 Ruth, I'll send this spreadsheet as I update it.  Talk to you soon. (I'm set up to come next Thursday with the boys).  Theresa 
 Bob, I'll pick San Diego as my winner. Where do I send a check to ? and what address?  Theresa Staab 
  Valerie,  FYI - from Robert Poole at Greeley Gas.  Robert: Maybe we can get together later this week to see if we can figure out the difference for August.  Let me know.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Try it again and let me know. 
 Valerie, Are you still having trouble with this?  I may need you to fax it to me so I can see it.  Call me because I think I'll have to use a different fax number and I'll need to get that for you.
