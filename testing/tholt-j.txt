s a cheap corporate rate that you can get-it's off the strip but it's nice. Every room is a sweat.  Just call and ask for it. 
 Sounds like a fun week-end.Hotel is  Vail Marriott Mountain Resort and Spa. I'll try to get an address and directions for you.Do you want a message, facial or both. 
 Tickets are free.   I don't think we'll need binoculars-seats are on floor. Enjoyed helping you over the week-end-that's what friends are for-at least where we came from.  The flowers you sent me are beautiful .. All of my favorites-gerber daisies and liliies.  You didn't  to do that with all of the furniture you gave me.  By the way-are your legs killing you.  My calves hurt like hell-think it's from going up and down the stairs barefoot on Saturday. I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.  Can't believe he didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.  Hey-we may want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green room. 
 Got the tickets today for Faith Hill-mark your calendar for Oct 13-starts at 8:00   Tina Turner is Sunda7-Oct. 29 
 that works 
 Need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us one day prior to noms due-that's too late to try to manage financially. 
 are you talking actual flows or what wAS NOMINATED 
 This was an EOL deal and EOL only trades in increments of 5000 so Zarin is not correct per our records. 
 I will let Joe know that you received his care package.  He will be very happy.  When I get my pictures developed, I'll send you any good ones that may have turned out.  It's O.K. to give Julie my e-mail address.  I would love to communicate with her.   Take care. 
 i switched the price on that deal and on 341270-they were reversed 
 Do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is assessed  reflects usage and not nominations.  Just don't want to be in a position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 20000. 
 This is O.K as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 8:30 C.T. and access to actuals within two business days. 
 Norm was somewhat prophetic when he kept talking about the "big hole in his pipe" that was going to occur if we went to rankings-little did he know-can't blame this one on rankings 
 You're not going to believe this.  I talked to Amoco and they confirmed that I did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay Agave Energy because tit's a complicated internal deal.  So we are both right..  I only wished Amoco would have told me ahead of time.  Bottom line- pay Agave Energy and not Amoco 
 I am getting your critical notices but when I click on it, I can't get access to what it says.  Is this a problem on your side or on my side. 
 this is a joke 
 Looks good to me.  Thanks. 
 Please give us the names of the wines she likes when you have time.

 I do not track volumes but I will forward this to our scheduling group-Patti Sullivan 
 We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks. 
 email address  is jane.m.tholt@enron.com pager is 8005060869 I trade the west desk 
 no-I wanted my machine to make a sound every time someone traded on EOL but instead it's hooked up to my keyboard so that when I type the keyboard makes sounds instead. 
 Please add me to the critical notices for Transwestern and El Paso Pipeline(s) as soon as possible.  If you have any questions , please call me at 35539. 
 The sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard supporting eol which is opposite of what I want.  I want the screen to ding every time someone trades on eol.  I don't want to listen to my self type in deals on the keyboard.  My Enron computer system works fine right now.  If you could handle getting the eol problem fixed I would appreciate it. 
 Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you send them something. 
 How come it doesn't work on my eol machine? 
 We did two deals that day we bought 4.70 and sold them 4.67-same volume 
 this afternoon-any time 
 yes we are going 
 My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge and prices.  A bunch of them turn 50 next year and are thinking of going on a fishing trip.  Can you give me any more information on prices and availiablity for next year.  Please advise what is included in the price and where we  need to fly into.  If you have any brochures, canyou send them to me at Jane Tholt, 7502 Highland Farms Rd., Houston, TX 77095  .  Hope you have a great day and it was great seeing you. 
 they are precious-he is a cutie for being only a couple of weeks old-thanks for sending me these 
 If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average. I made the request yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate. Upon discussing the product with Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present time.  I willkeep you advised.  Thank you for your patience. 
 The pictures came through the second time.  Hey-did you get my gift basket. 
 Please add Barreet Resources as an eligible party to trade the product US Gas Physical-non-Texas Points-Restricted for El Paso Physical Blanco  l Average. Please advise if you have any questions. 
 Joe and I would love to attend the bowling party.  We would like to have prawns for dinner.  We are arriving on Friday at 1:30 so we shouldn't have a problem being there.  Does Joe need to being his suit for Saturday night? 
 pictures never came thru-please try again 
 Ok to book for me and my husband, Joseph.  I was issued a new corporate American Express card.  Same number with expiration date of  3/03.  If you need any more info, please advise.   Otherwise, I will assume you will book the two tickets.  Thank you. 
 San Diego is correct we sold them  24000 mmbtu of gas at 4.67 
 Meeting was cancelled and never took place. 
 jtholtski1122 highland  Also,  Ican't find any of my bookmarks on internet explorer.  Where do I find them? 
 Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.  The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.  The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.  Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.  After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:  Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not relate to receipt point rights.  1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);  2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)  3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.  4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:  Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock Texaco   40    135 Burlington  26    74 Aero   5    15 Borax   7    12 LADWP  0    36 SWGas   0    20  5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:  Expansion Shippers  78000 Socal Gas           425000 BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams) Total 851000 540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.  The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.  Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El Paso's counter -proposal.  Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, they would not pay anything.  Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric rate.  Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.  Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows. El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets resolved.  Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions. 
 What am I suppose to do?  I don't trade barrels of crude and is the dispute regarding the price of crude on certain days or what?  I think this is an old del that Fred Lagrasta did. 
 Why are you sending this to me? 
 Since I do not track actual volume flows , you probably can contact Morgan at ext 36406.  She handles border flows. 
 When are we going to lunch in your new car? 
 I just received the shirts this morning.  They are perfect.  It's a pleasure doing business with you. 
 that is amazing 
 I don't think I do but thanks anyway. 
 It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.  Deb is moving into her new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.  I think we are going to try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open.. Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.  However, if something changes, we will let you know. 
 Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date. Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was so relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana over Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I are taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your ranch, is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly into Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date because I love to hike. 
 Becky-  If Burlington and Amoco have the right to turn back east end transport-ENA would like to be included in that group regarding turning back our Havasou transport. 
 Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation. Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.

 frott recline is really a foot recline and thanks for keeping me up to date with the happenings in your life. 
 Been pretty busy these last couple of weeks.  Couple of weeks ago I had to go to Los Angeles on short notice.  Accordingly, paid full price and got in first class.  It must have been a new plane because the first class section was huge.  I sat in a chair that was like a lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.  Also had my own pop up TV and could watch  my choice of 4 movies.  It was truly awesome.  Can't believe what  a small world it is. Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Stayed at the new Alladin Hotel.  They upgraded me to a suite.  Another great experience. Bathroom was huge.  Big marble shower and  a  big tub that overlooked the skyline.  Bedroom area and sitting area were nice too.  Shame I was only there one night.  Last week was Gas Fair.  Lots of lunches and dinners. There are a lot of new restaurants downtown that we tried out.  Yum-yum. The weather was perfect. .  Cheri and I went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day. She looks great.  She said you saw her picture of Matthew. He's a cutie. Parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever.  Had a lot of fun with Frank Fields too- he hasn't changed a bit .David Livingston was there.  He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God. Our retail group  just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them? I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted someone to pay for his way back to Houston.  Just found out that Bob Shiring went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.  Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.  He picked him up in San Antonio so we had them all week-end .  Went down to Kemah to watch the boats- we went there with Griff that one time.  Boy has it changed.  Tons more stuff to do -especially for the kids.  I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.  I exercised a ton of my options-and boy am I paying for it.  I was planning on  maybe paying $25000 but I am having to pay $47000.  Will probably be that way next year too. Just sucks that the government takes so much.  I know I'm probably not getting much sympathy from you but I can try.  Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.  Bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school.  Can't understand how these kids have access to all of these guns.  It's scary.  Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.  She did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.  Her family still does not know she is married.  She is being really strange about this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.  I've given up on her.  She is almost as strange as you at times.  Luckily I have not given up on you .  Going to Grand Cayman Islands on Thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on Friday-will tell you all about it.  Tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life.

 I want to penalize them for the volumes they are not taking on the trigger deal.  I know they are not going to pay but I still want to bill them anyway.  So- is the SW gas contract a one-way contract.  we are bound by their terms but they are not. 
 Looks good. Please book this.  Thank you. 
 DO NOT PAY PENALTY 
 why can't we use their contract to bill penalties 
 take that back price is 17.10 
 I show 17.00 
 Thank you-that was sweet.

 don't we have a gisb sontract with them that this would fall under 
 not sure how to handle- can you do for me 
 aol adress at home is jtholt1122@aol.com.  We are going to buy a camera-I'll let you know when we get it.  Joe is going to deliver some of Grady's cars to his new house.  I told him to take pictures for us.

 I'm assuming you are referring to the penalty invoice at the California Border.  That was a 30 day firm deal.  There is no GIC associated with that deal. 
 I also want to bill them for penalties for non-performance at PGE Topock on February 1. 
 DO NOT PAY 
 both deals were done at gda 
 Misplaced the cover sheet but they basically said that the baseload deal fell under an interruptilbe contract and was not subject ot damanges.  Laurie Ellis has a copy. 
 This is an old deal that was done in Fred Lagrosta'group-think it is a btu swap 
 GICS are negotiated 
 Cindy needed the money to pay for her new fully furnished house in the Woodlands.  not to mention the 55 acres she just bought across the road from her house in Aspen.  I only need enough to pay off my measley mortgage,  I have cashed in on most of my options though. 
 are you set up on aol instant messenger.  I got my new computer at home from Enron and I use that to talk back and forth with some of my freinds..  If you are set up  let me know., You and Joe could  talk on it all night long. 
 Need to know if what they say is true on there protest to invoice.  Do we only have an interruptible contract with them. 
 whichever one is active-scana energy-too many choices to pick from-counterparty list needs to be cleaned up.  Go ahead and change it. 
 Do we have a gisb contract with them 
 I received the fax.  Can you send them a firm contract because we I don't think we are going to do business with them unless they sign it 
 Fax Number is 7136463239.  What do you mean by protesting-Are they not paying. are they paying some but not all. 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you as well. 
 You think it's nice now-wait until the next big storm moves in  next week. Socal storage at 18 bcf.  Curtailments will probably happen. 90% rule in effect. Palo Verde went down.  San Onfre down for a long time. 
 changed it to Inside Ferc 
 LITTLE CHILLY IN SAN DIEGO.   SOCAL STORAGE AT 24 BCF-CURRENT WITHDRAWAL RATE IS 1 BCF DAY.  SUPPOSE TO REMAIN COLD FOR THE REMAINDER OF MONTH.   WORSE YET-A NUCLEAR PLANT WAS SUPPOSE TO COME BACK BUT THEY HAD A FIRE AT SAN ONOFRE-OUT FOR AWHILE.  BETTER BUY YOURSELF SOME BLANKETS. 
 thank you for your efforts regarding this matter 
 I wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out of you.   Res. Elec.

I know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own selfish reasons. 
 I want the penalty billed and let them challenge it. 
 I got the pictures.  He is precious.  I can see why you are so happy and want to stay home with him. 
 Gas daily plus $.15-make sure legal approves 
 This is not going to get resolved.  They disagree with our view and are not going to pay on scheduled volumes.  However, we are not going back off our view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes. 
 yes -if that's what the contract says 
 this was a regular 30 day deal. 
 I'm not sure what contract this falls under. Our contract says that if buyer does not schedule then buyer will pay  replacement price differential plus $.15.  Rpalcement price differnetial would be gas daily which was around 16.80 on that day. 
 Sale is based on IF 
 triggers are based upon scheduled volume-they are not going to agree-I know 
 price on the 7th was 9.55 I don't understand the trigger question.  We need to get the back-up on the penalty.  Patti needs to give you info regarding a penalty we wanto tocharge them for February.  Please get with her ondetails. 
 No equipment was installed.  It is under my desk waiting for arms to be installed above my other monitor.  What is the status of getting these arms 
 Call me when you can make room for me in your schedule. 
 I am still waiting for this to be instaled. What's the hold-up? 
 thank you 
 Thank you.  Congratulations.

 Mark Hawkins with Mercado Gas called and said that he would like to pay us for this gas but does not know who to call for the invoice.. Please have someone call him at 512-370-8225. 
 yes-we received our allocation  last week. 
 Thank you.  They look really cool. 
 We have not turned the capacity back and I think it's a good idea if we can get a ruling . 
 I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th (mon).  I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for breakfast or lunch let me know.  I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to check with you  first. 
 Did you see pacific ga sna delectric ' stock today? 
 Thank you for advising me of this issue.  When you get back-up , please forward to Patti Sullivan.  We are going to work on charging them some penalties for a differnet month to help offset this. 
 I currently trade on the west desk gas desk and would like to get access to the westpower.enron.com website.  Phillip Allen thought that maybe you could help me.  Please advise.  Thank you. 
 Deb and I were thinking that if we can't finalize our Europe trip by the end of this week-we probably need to postpone it because the clock is ticking. . Can you give us any feedback on your discussions with  American Express or Mark Frevert..  Thinking about you. 
 long term forecast does not show it warming up either 
 can't wait
