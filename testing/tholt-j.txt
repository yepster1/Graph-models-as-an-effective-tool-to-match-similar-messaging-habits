t coast stuff.  Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.  He picked him up in San Antonio so we had them all week-end .  Went down to Kemah to watch the boats- we went there with Griff that one time.  Boy has it changed.  Tons more stuff to do -especially for the kids.  I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.  I exercised a ton of my options-and boy am I paying for it.  I was planning on  maybe paying $25000 but I am having to pay $47000.  Will probably be that way next year too. Just sucks that the government takes so much.  I know I'm probably not getting much sympathy from you but I can try.  Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.  Bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school.  Can't understand how these kids have access to all of these guns.  It's scary.  Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.  She did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.  Her family still does not know she is married.  She is being really strange about this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.  I've given up on her.  She is almost as strange as you at times.  Luckily I have not given up on you .  Going to Grand Cayman Islands on Thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on Friday-will tell you all about it.  Tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life.

 I want to penalize them for the volumes they are not taking on the trigger deal.  I know they are not going to pay but I still want to bill them anyway.  So- is the SW gas contract a one-way contract.  we are bound by their terms but they are not. 
 Looks good. Please book this.  Thank you. 
 DO NOT PAY PENALTY 
 why can't we use their contract to bill penalties 
 take that back price is 17.10 
 I show 17.00 
 Thank you-that was sweet. 
 Thank you for the inof town guests in .vitation but I have out 
 look at sitara 588471;588452;588605;596991 
 don't we have a gisb sontract with them that this would fall under 
 not sure how to handle- can you do for me 
 aol adress at home is jtholt1122@aol.com.  We are going to buy a camera-I'll let you know when we get it.  Joe is going to deliver some of Grady's cars to his new house.  I told him to take pictures for us.

 I'm assuming you are referring to the penalty invoice at the California Border.  That was a 30 day firm deal.  There is no GIC associated with that deal. 
 I also want to bill them for penalties for non-performance at PGE Topock on February 1. 
 DO NOT PAY 
 both deals were done at gda 
 Misplaced the cover sheet but they basically said that the baseload deal fell under an interruptilbe contract and was not subject ot damanges.  Laurie Ellis has a copy. 
 This is an old deal that was done in Fred Lagrosta'group-think it is a btu swap 
 GICS are negotiated 
 Cindy needed the money to pay for her new fully furnished house in the Woodlands.  not to mention the 55 acres she just bought across the road from her house in Aspen.  I only need enough to pay off my measley mortgage,  I have cashed in on most of my options though. 
 are you set up on aol instant messenger.  I got my new computer at home from Enron and I use that to talk back and forth with some of my freinds..  If you are set up  let me know., You and Joe could  talk on it all night long. 
 Need to know if what they say is true on there protest to invoice.  Do we only have an interruptible contract with them. 
 whichever one is active-scana energy-too many choices to pick from-counterparty list needs to be cleaned up.  Go ahead and change it. 
 Do we have a gisb contract with them 
 I received the fax.  Can you send them a firm contract because we I don't think we are going to do business with them unless they sign it 
 Fax Number is 7136463239.  What do you mean by protesting-Are they not paying. are they paying some but not all. 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you as well. 
 You think it's nice now-wait until the next big storm moves in  next week. Socal storage at 18 bcf.  Curtailments will probably happen. 90% rule in effect. Palo Verde went down.  San Onfre down for a long time. 
 changed it to Inside Ferc 
 LITTLE CHILLY IN SAN DIEGO.   SOCAL STORAGE AT 24 BCF-CURRENT WITHDRAWAL RATE IS 1 BCF DAY.  SUPPOSE TO REMAIN COLD FOR THE REMAINDER OF MONTH.   WORSE YET-A NUCLEAR PLANT WAS SUPPOSE TO COME BACK BUT THEY HAD A FIRE AT SAN ONOFRE-OUT FOR AWHILE.  BETTER BUY YOURSELF SOME BLANKETS. 
 thank you for your efforts regarding this matter 
 I wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out of you.   Res. Elec. Other Total Jan 99 3.16 .84 2.83 6.82 Jan00 2.80 1.21 2.87 6.87 Jan01 3.05 2.22 2.57 7.84  Feb 99 3.07 .80 2.69 6.56 Feb00 2.72 1.22 2.72 6.65 Feb012.80 2.22 2.42 7.44  Mar99 3.08 .75 2.42 6.25 Mar00 2.65 .98 2.48 6.12 Mar 012.67 2.03 2.18 6.88    Also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day.  I know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own selfish reasons. 
 I want the penalty billed and let them challenge it. 
 I got the pictures.  He is precious.  I can see why you are so happy and want to stay home with him. 
 Gas daily plus $.15-make sure legal approves 
 This is not going to get resolved.  They disagree with our view and are not going to pay on scheduled volumes.  However, we are not going back off our view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes. 
 yes -if that's what the contract says 
 this was a regular 30 day deal. 
 I'm not sure what contract this falls under. Our contract says that if buyer does not schedule then buyer will pay  replacement price differential plus $.15.  Rpalcement price differnetial would be gas daily which was around 16.80 on that day. 
 Sale is based on IF 
 triggers are based upon scheduled volume-they are not going to agree-I know 
 price on the 7th was 9.55 I don't understand the trigger question.  We need to get the back-up on the penalty.  Patti needs to give you info regarding a penalty we wanto tocharge them for February.  Please get with her ondetails. 
 No equipment was installed.  It is under my desk waiting for arms to be installed above my other monitor.  What is the status of getting these arms 
 Call me when you can make room for me in your schedule. 
 I am still waiting for this to be instaled. What's the hold-up? 
 thank you 
 Thank you.  Congratulations.

 Mark Hawkins with Mercado Gas called and said that he would like to pay us for this gas but does not know who to call for the invoice.. Please have someone call him at 512-370-8225. 
 yes-we received our allocation  last week. 
 Thank you.  They look really cool. 
 We have not turned the capacity back and I think it's a good idea if we can get a ruling . 
 I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th (mon).  I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for breakfast or lunch let me know.  I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to check with you  first. 
 Did you see pacific ga sna delectric ' stock today? 
 Thank you for advising me of this issue.  When you get back-up , please forward to Patti Sullivan.  We are going to work on charging them some penalties for a differnet month to help offset this. 
 I currently trade on the west desk gas desk and would like to get access to the westpower.enron.com website.  Phillip Allen thought that maybe you could help me.  Please advise.  Thank you. 
 Deb and I were thinking that if we can't finalize our Europe trip by the end of this week-we probably need to postpone it because the clock is ticking. . Can you give us any feedback on your discussions with  American Express or Mark Frevert..  Thinking about you. 
 long term forecast does not show it warming up either 
 can't wait
