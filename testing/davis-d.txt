bernick's email that she sent  yesterday morning titled "Detention Notice". 
 2.	Malibu Grand Prix 
 I just used all the recon folders for the companies that Kristi just gave me.  I'm going to have Nicole order more tomorrow. 
 Girl, get your butt back in the house and don't come again!  Yes we got your message and there is no problem with you being out. Get some rest and feel better soon.  Dana 
 I'm taking a half day vacation Monday but I will be in after lunch; around 1pm. 
 I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.  Thanks, Dana X3-7520

 I'll be looking forward to receiving that report and thank you for the update.  Mrs. Davis 
 So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this due that paper not being turned in? 
 Oh God Carolyn, Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.  You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.  Love your sister,  Dana 
   Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -  Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.  Mrs. Davis 713 853-7520 wk 281 583-1348 hm 
 I tried to add you to my MSN Instant Messenger service but Enron's email firewall has heightened it's security disabling me to log into outside email accounts.  Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service.  That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there? 
 I wondered whose email address this was when I saw it on one of Uncle Joes emails.  Thanks so much for the E postcards that you sent me.  I guess you have talked to Monte?  Email me back so we can talk.  Oh, I need your physical address so I can send you something.  Love you.  Mrs. Dana 
 Please let me know exactly what paper you are speaking of so that I may address this issue with intelligently.  Thanks for the emails.    Dana Davis 713-853-7520 
 What paper? 
 I am stepping out for lunch right now but when return I will give you a call or an email.  What time is your conference time?  Dana Davis 713-853-7520 
 OK. 
 OK, no problem.  Thanks. 
 OK.  Pat how fast do you need it? 
 Dana, This is for you. 
 FYI: 
 Yes Bobbie, I will confirm that but hopefully not for long.  : ) 
 Yes, I have thought about being an Admin.  I just don't see any entry level administrative positions out there. 
 Dana, This is for you. 
 It wasn't "Shackles" silly.  The 1st song is "What A Friend We Have In Jesus". 
 Do you have any of their cd's?  The one with the song "Shackles"?  I was listening to it this morning and I thought about you. 
 Have you heard of Mary Mary? 
 Davette, Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : )   I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.  Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.  I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.  So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.  That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.  God Bless Each of you and Season's Greetings  Love  Marylyn ________________________________________________________________ GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!

 That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P.,  I would like to use the short ones.
