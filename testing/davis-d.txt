 Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee cause if you go, I GO!  Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last Wednesday.  "DON'T QUOTE ME" Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut off  Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll see you tonight at choir rehearsal.  dd 
 See if you can open these up Tony.  They are real funny video clips.
