 Angela,  It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST  Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D Historicals Only"  Thanks.  Mat 
 Angela,  Here's the NWPL historicals.  Thanks.  Mat

 I'm not visiting you.  You're just a place to lay my head. 
 ENRON ROCKS! 
 Tuesday is good for me as far as I could tell.  Mat 
 Imad,  Just wanted to let you know that I passed your resume on to the desk director.  Mat 
 Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say about you.  Hope all is well.  Mat 
 I would look at it again, but I'm late for my class.  The only way to reach me is by pager - 713-716-0795.  Sorry,  Mat 
 Imad,  I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second or third rotation?  Mat 
 The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.  Mat 
 Use this file, NOT the previous one sent.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Dear GEICO,  I have no idea who those people are that are identified in your email.

Smith   at-fault accident  We will resume the processing of your request as soon as we receive the details requested above.  Sincerely,  GEICO DIRECT 
 Reagan,  Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.   Mat 
 Hey, I didn't call you back because of the fuckup that I learned of right after you hung up on me.  I'm sorry. 
 Don't mess with Texas.....especially the women!    http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/metropolitan/637152 
 Yo, you about ready? 
 Marlo,  Can you please forward that email you sent me to Patti Sullivan since I have not used the path manager and my mail forward feature is not working.  Thanks.  Mat 
 I didn't forget, I'm just new to Lotus... 
 Marlo,  As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.  Mat 
 Hey, I hope you've gotton a chance to get a phone any everything.  I finally have access to all the computer applications that I need.  If only I had access to the directories with the required files!  Anyway, I wondering what you thought about drinks after work thursday and if you had any venue preference?  Mat 
 Thanks, Gwen. 
 Angela,  As discussed, the following file contains hisoricals for PGE.  Chris should have deleted data in the database from the middle of March back so you can import anytime.  This data goes up to 2/6/01 and Chris will reload from 2/7/01 to present.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Hey, I just wanted to pass along my phone numbers for future reference:  Office:   3-0472 Home: 713-784-8180 Cell: 832-444-7702  By the way, I finally spoke with Jennifer today.  She would like to get together with us for a few beers whenever we decide.   Mat 
 Lunch on Friday sounds great.  Mat 
 Regan,  Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's just say my plate looks to be full.  By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland. Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as well.  I'd like to know more.  Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  Later,  Mat 
 It's funny, even the southern ones.  How was your night?  Please send e-mail to my compuserve account from now on (mds12403@cs.com).  Thanks.  Mat 
 Sorry for the no call.  I was busy until about 10 pm and....well I just got interupted.   Anyway, I'll call you later...ok?   I promise.  Mat 
 Yes, I'm scheduling for the West desk, so I need whatever software package is required.  Thanks. 
 Don't get too excited to hear about the rest of the day...I don't have much positive to write.  It's been boring and I'm very uneasy about my role in this group.  More later...  Mat 
 Email and phone conversation at the same time! 
 Jeanne,  Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the week.  Thanks you.  Mat

 Yan,  Please make the PGE daily report (#26) available on your website.  Thanks.  Mat
