oing to send me the names of those guys in London we talked to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.  Mat 
 Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you want to chat sometime.  Mat 
 Tom,  I took a few days off and just got back....  Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day. Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?  Mat 
 Tom,  Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are those on the Optimizer sheet:  Start/End Date Spreads Max Inj/With rates Max Storage volume Selected Curve Storage Facility  I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.  Mat 
 Sounds good. 
 Matt,  Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.  Mat 
 Of course I knew that.  The question is, why were you calling him?  ms 
 Don't mess with Texas.....especially the women!    http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/metropolitan/637152 
 He's working for realastate management company.  very small, but of course, paying better than pirnie.  ms 
 I will look at it later today. 
 Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.  Talk to you later.  Mat 
 So where the hell was it? 
 both. 
 testing you bitch. mat 
 Hey fucko, give me a call.  You should come to NYC this weekend and party with your friends. 
 yo, i'm still coming.  saturday would be great.  I'm in the city all day and night, and the only plans i have are to go to the game sat.  I'll call you when i get a chance.  My cell phone is 832-444-7702.  Looking forward to seeing you.  mat 
 Just one thing, my first name only has one "t" in it.  Thanks.  Mat    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey, I didn't call you back because of the fuckup that I learned of right after you hung up on me.  I'm sorry. 
 testing 1 2 3. 
 4069450@archwireless.net 
 Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.  Mat 
 Chris,  I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments. Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my fundy responsibilities.  Mat 
 i would love to, except for the fact that I have a 4:30 meeting, because of which I had to cancel my flying time!  Call me later.  and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try my phone or pager 8774892073@pagenetmessage.net in the future.   Mat 
 test 
 thanks. 
 Chris,  This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Can you please add this link to the fundy website under the Power tab.  It should be called "Proposed Gas Generation Plants".  Thanks.  Mat 
 Chris,  Use this file instead.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Reagan,  Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.   Mat 
 Dad told about you changing the ticket, but thanks.  Um, i look forward to hearing about this little accident (at least  i hope it was little). 
 waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!  and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.  Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking my green beer.  About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.  Later, Mateo 
 Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar pipeline.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Orangemen suck.  I hate Syracuse.  I'm no longer a fan. 
 Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.  We'll definitely be hitting the town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Please move the file i sent you from the Testing tab to the West directory under the Pipeline tab.  I have updated it in the Testing tab so discard the version i emailed.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Dipak,  As you requested, here are the West Desk's forecasts for California Reciepts minus instate production by month.  They are broken down into delivery points onto Socal and PGE's system.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Please add add a link called "Plant Outages (portland)", to the Gas Fundamentals website under the Power tab.  The description is as follows:  "Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today."  Thanks.  Mat 
 i haven't created it yet.  I was hoping to have the link there, so that I can put the file in the directory tomorrow morning (before you get in).  It will be called "curtailments.xls".  Mat    Enron North America Corp. 
 Dear GEICO,  I have no idea who those people are that are identified in your email.  I would be interested in knowing how some random peoples' driving incidents are some how associated with me and my insurance application.  I have never had an insurance claim.  Please feel free to contact me with any further questions.  Mathew Smith   Dear Mr. Smith:  Thank you for your request for auto insurance.  Please provide the details requested below to expedite the processing of your request.  We routinely run a claims history for all new policies and the following claims were found.  Please provide details of each claim:  1.08-22-99  Gregoire B. Poyet-Smith  at fault accident  2.12-09-98  James A. Smith   at-fault accident  We will resume the processing of your request as soon as we receive the details requested above.  Sincerely,  GEICO DIRECT 
 thanks.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Amanda,  Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.  Mat 
 fyi,  Mat 
 Ya, it was finalized last thursday night.  this should already be in our forecasts.  Mat 
 Team,  The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.  Mat 
 that's fine.  thanks.  Mat 
 Chris,  Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mat 
 Yan,  Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.  Mat 
 why can't you go, or do you just not want to? 
 and you think i'd want to go with them?  actually, i thought that they had a ticket for me too. 
 Email and phone conversation at the same time! 
 The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.  Mat 
 David,  Here's the information for the Portland database:  Machine name:  napdx-sql1 user id:  gasintranet password:  fundamentals  The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb  The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.  In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start. The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.  Mat 
 that bitch.  j/k.  thanks. 
 Philip,  I'm sorry this took so long, I thought I sent it ealier, but apparently not. Let me know if you need anything else.  Mat 
 For later.  Mat 
 Angela,  This file contains the historicals for Socal in the specified format.  Can you please dump them into the database.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Angela,  Here are some more historicals for socal (I didn't realize we had these additional years).  They are in ADDITION to those already loaded.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Yan,  Please make the PGE daily report (#26) available on your website.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Angela,  As discussed, the following file contains hisoricals for PGE.  Chris should have deleted data in the database from the middle of March back so you can import anytime.  This data goes up to 2/6/01 and Chris will reload from 2/7/01 to present.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Use this file, NOT the previous one sent.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Angela,  Here's the NWPL historicals.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Imad,  I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second or third rotation?  Mat 
 Abijeet,  Here are the ones I did for you to check against your values.  Thanks.  Mat 
 new file:  Thanks,  Mat 
 Jeanie,  I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.  Mat 
 David,  This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and "Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Hey, I'm going to give your resume to this girl, and I'll let you know when to follow up.  Mat 
 try this.  thanks.  Mat 
 Angela,  Try this one.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Mog,  Here's the Socal file as requested.  As I indicated, this information is a competitive advantage of ours, so it should stay in the company.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Mog,  As requested, here is the Socal file.  Please keep this within the company, as it represents a competitive advantage to Enron. Thanks.   Mat 
 I would look at it again, but I'm late for my class.  The only way to reach me is by pager - 713-716-0795.  Sorry,  Mat 
 Phillip,  Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.  Mat 
 I am no longer looking for assitance in finding an apartment, but thank you for your attempts at contacting me.  Mat 
 Patti,  Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/  Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.  Mat 
 Mike,  Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.  Mat 
 Yan,  The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  31 Keystone Receipts 15 Questar Pipeline 40 Rockies Production 22 West_2 23 West_3 25 CIG_WIC  The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.  Mat  PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points. 
 Chris,  The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  Mat  PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week. 
 Angela,  It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST  Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D Historicals Only"  Thanks.  Mat

 Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say about you.  Hope all is well.  Mat

 Pedro,  I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I can do.  Mathew Smith 
 I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large (I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.  With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,  Mateo. 
 Brief,  Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day. So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold of you?  Here's some digits for you:  w.  713-853-0472 h.  713-784-8180 m. 832-444-7702 p.  713-716-0795  You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  El Presidente 
 OK 
 Thursday definitely no...friday maybe.  Also Dave Shank is in town to work with Marine this week.  You remember Dave don't you? 
 What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day this time...  Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.  Mat 
 Make sure you take care of Dave... 
 Awesome dude!  I'll definitely be around.  Hey, maybe you can bring my wine (or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).  Mat 
 Yes, I'm scheduling for the West desk, so I need whatever software package is required.  Thanks. 
 Mi casa es su casa.  I've got plenty of room.  Hey what's this I hear about you and Heather looking for a plot of land? 
 Pablo,  Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.    Error 500--Internal Server Error From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1: 10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.   Thanks.  Mat 
 Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since they didn't give us the technical tests. 
 I need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that I don't already know. 
 Any news yet? 
 huh? 
 I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info. 
 Cool.  I actually left a message with Ted, but obviously I've heard nothing. 
 Thanks. 
 Mark,  Did we not already do this?  Mat 
 Sorry for the no call.  I was busy until about 10 pm and....well I just got interupted.   Anyway, I'll call you later...ok?   I promise.  Mat 
 Aah, thanks for the clarification. 
 Damn it!  What did I say?  Do you read your emails or what?  I want descriptions!  I want chicks.  I need a chick.  I need a really cool  chick to hang out with. 
 My response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks. 
 Seriously, you better fucking call me.  Mark's away and I'm lonely. 
 no. 
 Hey, you still coming to H-town? 
 Hey, I, for some reason, just got your email.  Anyway,  I'll try to call you later in the morning, but if you want to call me at work my # is 713-853-0472.  Talk to you soon.  Mat 
 I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how this "track" will actually affect me.  Happy hour tomorrow?  Mat 
 Jeanie,  As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be interested.  See you around,  Mat 
 Hey, are you there..............................? 
 It's funny, even the southern ones.  How was your night?  Please send e-mail to my compuserve account from now on (mds12403@cs.com).  Thanks.  Mat 
 Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.  I was thinking about old times. I can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically hear you yacking on the phone....or whispering to Jimmy.... 
 Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to refresh it manually.  It sucks....  So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.  Later.  Mat 
 Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you should so you can send me an instant message. 
 Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.................................? 
 Well, will discuss that later.  Call me whenever you want.  Mat 
 Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

 Regan,  Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's just say my plate looks to be full.  By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland. Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as well.  I'd like to know more.  Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  Later,  Mat 
 Sure, unless I'm on a flight. 
 Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9. 
 So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance.  Mat 
 Leo,  Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be happy to with a little notice.  Mat 
 Kristen,  How often do you check your cell phone and email for messages?  Mat 
 Tracy,  I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still attend these sessions.  Thank you.  Mathew Smith 
 Kristen,  Just wanted to let you know that I didn't get any emails from you last night or today. 
 Steve,  Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.  Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.  Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.  Take care,  Mat 
 Louis,  When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?  Mathew Smith 3-0472 
 Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip. 
 Lunch on Friday sounds great.  Mat 
 Steve,  I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension? Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702.  Later dude. 
 That is good to hear.  Give me a call today as you indicated.  Mat 
 FYI  How are you feeling today?  I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I=20 actually feel pretty good.  I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said I= =20 could definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the e= nd=20 of jan and his tour might be over!  still waiting to hear whether a=20 non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other year= . =20 I thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work down= =20 there.  Interesting.... anyway, I finally got signed up for the continental= =20 travel specials.  I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go to= =20 Louisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.  I'd take=20 advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its a= =20 little late to switch with somebody. =20  Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit=20 around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.  Later....=20 
 Hola, como estas?  yo estoy malo. 
 Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system. The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad. Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for you..........................Adios. 
 Matt, I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing.  I'm working this weekend so I'll give it a go.  Thanks.  Mat 
 That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.  Mat 
 Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :(  I just want to be loved....  Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call later.  I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off.  Mat 
 Brief,  You name the time and the place between 2:30 pm Friday January 12th through 12 pm Monday January 15th!  Pres  713-784-8180 h 713-853-0472 w 832-444-7702 m 
 OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

 Hey, I just wanted to pass along my phone numbers for future reference:  Office:   3-0472 Home: 713-784-8180 Cell: 832-444-7702  By the way, I finally spoke with Jennifer today.  She would like to get together with us for a few beers whenever we decide.   Mat 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Cheryl,  I will be attending the reception on Thursday for the A/A program.  Thanks.  Mathew Smith 
 Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering.  Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.  Have a nice day.  Mat 
 Hey, are you at work today? 
 Did you have fun last night? 
 Are you busy? 
 I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later. 
 Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of skiing!  I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.  Stay cool.  Mateo. 
 Who are you? 
 So tired I am.
