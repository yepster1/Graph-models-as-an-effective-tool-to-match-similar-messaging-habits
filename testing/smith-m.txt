ad my hard drive switched out last week, I have to reinstall SQL server on my computer.  However, because of the latest virus scare, they've taken away my administrator access to my machine.  This should all be taken care of this week.  Please check back with me, and I should be able to provide you with the load data.  Mat 
 Chris,  The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  Mat  PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week. 
 Ina,  Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?  Maybe it was used at one time or another, but just got forgotten.  Anyway, it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building.  Thanks.  Mat 
 thanks. 
 Steve,  Do you have part 3 and 4 of this document?  The last page we have has figure 6, but it looks like there was supposed to be further sections.  Mat 
 right now, i'm leaning towards no, but my friend Kristen isn't being very cooperative about getting back to me.  thanks for keeping me apprised of the situation. 
 Aaron, this is Mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included.  The files includes rates, receipt and delivery points, and live links to an EOL listen sheet.  It's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed.  Also, we do need an ops sheet modified.  Basically, we're trying to develop a net total for Keystone production.  More importantly, by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work.  This is absolutely critical since we have a Nuke going out on Saturday and a major coal plant down.  Let me know if you have any issues.  Stop by sometime about the Keystone modification.  Mat 
 thanks 
 Chris,  I need to reinstall SQL on my machine.  Can you send me the link to the setup file in the IT directory.  I can't remember where it is.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Ina,  Ya, the departure should now be Thursday Oct. 18th.  I think the 11:15 am flight will do.  Everything else remains the same.  Thanks.  Mat  PS.  My frequent flyer # is EG235566 
 Hey,  You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already!  Hope you're staying warm and dry.  Mat 
 Hey, I think I lost your work number.  Can you send me it or give me a call at work.  Mat 
 Hey, I got an error back because the files were too big.  I'll stick them in the dropbox in a folder called scheadul.  Mat 
 thanks 
 Bart,  Until we can get the proper access, just come over when you need the loads and I'll create a file for you.  Mat 
 in general, we want all history available.  You never know when they're going to remove it. 
 can you email me the gzn file.  My hard drive was replaced and I lost everything on my desktop. 
 Aaron,  The report you dropped off is a good start.  I'm going to regroup some of the points.  I'll drop it off when I'm finished.  Thanks.  Mat 
 nice.  texas humor. 
 Maria,  Since you set my security up for the fundamentals database, I can't access any of the outage tables.  Can you make sure that I have access to those tables with my NT id "msmith18".  Previously, I would use the "gasintranet" ID and "fundamentals" password.  Thanks.  Mat

 Chris,  Hey, I noticed that we have two Portland lines on our boxes.  No one is around right now, but I'm wondering if it works, or if anyone ever uses it.  I just got a box, and I have the second line programmed in.  If you get a chance, why don't you see if it works on your end.  Mat 
 Gerry,  Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.  Mathew Smith 
 Zo,  What's up my brother?  Long time no speak.  I just got your email from Scotty P (somehow he found me).  Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to Houston again for a job with Enron.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....  Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.  Hope all is well.  Mat 
 you've got most of them, i guess i probably just need to define the major ones for the high level screen... 
 Jan,  Are you guys still planning on selling gas back?  Mat 
 my canadian beer of choice is Labatt. 
 Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.  And no, it's nothing personally related to me.  Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.  The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.  We move in November 9th.  Should be pretty cool.  I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.  Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.  Must leave soon...... 
 Actually, I don't know the number yet.  Cell phone still the best.  Sorry, I haven't been available last night.  I was out.  Anyway, what's the news?  Mat 
 goat?  i think that's only true for fraternity pledges. 
 No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit into, though..... 
 More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is. 
 To Whom This May Concern,  I have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order.  Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address.  In response, I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location.  The address should read Manor Way Office, but reference the specified apartment number.  Pete and Christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery.  If the offices are still considered "residential" you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge, which I understand to be not more than $30.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  713-853-047 (day)  Mathew Smith

 Nice.  I found grandmom to be very sexy. 
 Hey,  Nice to hear from you.  No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.  Just work work work.  Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.  When is a good time now?  I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.  By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.  Anyway, let's chat sometime... Talk to you soon.   Mat 
 Ina,  I still cannot access Sitara Reports.  After you last let me know it was taken care of, I do seem to remember it being accessible.  However, it definitely is not working currently.  Mat 
 Hey Christine,  Everythings pretty normal around here.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the shirts.  I think they're great.  Mat 
 Maria,  Do you know if you guys have started capturing the RT Final import flows from Oasis yet?  Mat 
 Come by and I'll show you where it is.  Mat 
 Dave,  Hey,  can you create a view for me on Portland's database.  The SQL code is below.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Mat    SELECT     dbo.MOD_Load.DateTimeValue, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DateValue, dbo.LkpMOD_Scenario.ScenarioCode, dbo.LkpMOD_Region.RegionCode, AVG(dbo.MOD_Load.Load_MW) AS [Ave Dly Ld], dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.MonthName, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DayNum, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.YearNum, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DayOfWeekName, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.PeakOrOffPeak FROM         dbo.MOD_Load INNER JOIN dbo.LkpMOD_Region ON dbo.MOD_Load.RegionID = dbo.LkpMOD_Region.RegionID INNER JOIN dbo.LkpMOD_Scenario ON dbo.MOD_Load.ScenarioID = dbo.LkpMOD_Scenario.ScenarioID INNER JOIN dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions ON dbo.MOD_Load.DateTimeValue = dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DateTimeValue GROUP BY dbo.LkpMOD_Scenario.ScenarioCode, dbo.LkpMOD_Region.RegionCode, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DateValue, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.YearNum, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.MonthName, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DayOfWeekName, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.PeakOrOffPeak, dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DayNum, dbo.MOD_Load.DateTimeValue HAVING      (dbo.LkpMOD_Scenario.ScenarioCode = 'BEST') AND (dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DateValue BETWEEN CONVERT(DATETIME, '2001-09-01 00:00:00', 102) AND CONVERT(DATETIME, '2001-12-31 00:00:00', 102)) ORDER BY dbo.LkpCalendar_Definitions.DateValue DESC, dbo.MOD_Load.DateTimeValue 
 copy to desktop and double-click to run.  gzn 
 Chris and Eddie,  I noticed that since Sept. 20, cycle 13 from NWPL has not been making it into the database, thus showing errors in our Ops report.  The Latest Scrape Information does not current show any errors in capture.  Can you please look into this and get back to me.  Thanks.  Mat 
   gzn 
 FYI, the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages, as well as detail about the plant characteristics, so that you may be able to use some of their code. 
 Dave,  Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.  Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.  Mat 
 Dave,  Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.  Mat 
 Maria,  IF-NTHWST/CANBR  This is sumas.   Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).  Let me know if you need anything else.  Mat 
 Maria,  I think that the curve names are the same for index as for basis (which you currently pull), except that you specify the curve type as index instead of basis.  I've never looked in the database, so I've never seen the fields.  Hope this helps.  Mat 
 NG	PRC IF-ELPO/SJ	INDEX CIG/RKYMTN	INDEX NWPL_ROCKY_M	INDEX NW STANF/1ST	INDEX KERN/RIVER	INDEX PGE/TOPOCK	INDEX NGI-SOCAL	INDEX PGE/CG	INDEX IF-ELPO/PERMIAN	INDEX  Maria,  I don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for, but these should give you a start.  Let me know which ones, I've left out from your list.  Mat 
 Anne,  Actually, I'm not sure whether I want Gas Daily Index's or Physical Index's...Gas Daily preferably.  A list or the file you use would be great.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Maria,  Hey, I installed SQL server...I feel like a real professional now.  Although, I don't remember exactly which table I'm looking for.  I found one that's MOD_Load that looks like it's the one.  If it is, where do I find what the Scenario ID field means?  By the way, I'm still working on those index curves.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Anne,  Hey, do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the Oracle database for west index curves?  Mat 
 Maria,  Try these...  GDP-ELPO/SANJUA GDP-ELPO/PERM2 GDP-SOCAL  I'm still working on those other curves.  Mat 
 ? 
 Lindon,  It looks like we need to add 9908 to the list.  After that i think we're done.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Are you going to bring me the list of trades with the counterparty names? 
 Kimat,  For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.  I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.  It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.  I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.  Can you please look into this.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Ina,  A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.  You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.  Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.  Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.  Thanks.  Mat 
  I'll also drop off a copy of the population weighting.  Mat 
 Anytime you get a chance is fine.  Just let me know, but I'll tentatively plan on 3 pm.  Mat 
 Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.  We'll definitely be hitting the town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.  Mat 
 Angela,  CIG (#42) is almost complete, but we have a few data changes to make:  First, for DRN 24906 Big Blue Meter Station, please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 with values below listed from 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 and delete records with effective date 4/21/01.  Also, please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries.  39014 39982 32987 44781 41381 41357 40586   Second, for DRN 16688 Keyes, Town of, please delete both the receipt and delivery records for effective data 4/21/01 and the receipt record for effective date 4/8/01.  Thanks.  Mat 
 i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.  I hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.  i don't think i was that drunk, but who knows.  plus, i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing.  oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.  anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full moon...make sure to look out for the goblins... 
 um, are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted... 
 hey, don't forget that report...Keith's bugging me.  thanks. 
 Sounds like a trick question...Obviously, you would take offence to me answering "no" for any reason at all.  However, I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason.  Though, if I answer "yes", it might imply that I don't like you now because you do not work at Enron, and somehow make you wish you did.  So....the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity (as long as it isn't too close), but who i like is regardless of employment..... 
 OK, I changed my mind...the answer is yes. 
 All I can say is that I'm not buying any.... 
 I don't recall needing any additional functionality from CQG.  In fact, I don't even use CQG.  Could you be referring to someone else.  Mat 
 Chris,  Please add the following locations for pipeline #42 and populate with indicated flow type..........  109489 		Bullfrog Meter Station (BUL)		R 4065		Desert Springs Meter Station (DES)	R,D 41449		Pueblo North Meter Station (PUE)	D 2546		Western Sugar Meter Station (WES)	D  Thanks.  Mat  PS.  We'll probably have a few more for WIC in the next day or so, but let's get these in to finish out CIG. 
 told you so... 
 Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's everything with you? 
 Keith,  Hey, is the plotter working, such that I could get a print out of that WSCC map you made for me a week or two ago.  Thanks.  Mat 
 you just want my address...2125 Sul Ross, Houston, TX, 77057.... 
 well, i only got single prints...so i have to get copies or scan them or something...so it may take a bit..sorry.  About the sock, ya I'm short on socks...so it would be great if you sent it, but if not, don't worry about it. 
 Maria,  Hey, your database sucks!  (j/k) Give me a ring when you get a chance.  Mat 
 well...here we are.  i'm still not buying. 
 it's a little iffy right now... i'm planning for not having one, although i'll in the one place that the company is trying to preserve. 
 not much i guess.  I'm sure you heard the CNBC speel earlier.  I have no news other than that. 
 Looks like Dynegy may buy us. 
 Chris,  I assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.  Mat 
 nope 
 true...i think the dynegy equity investment is dead...i think the discussion are about a full take over. 
 well, i was just in a meeting for an hour... 
 ug...this day is taking forever...absolutely nothing going on here. 
 Stephanie,  Do you have any idea when this will be completed?  Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Kam,  Apparently, Stephanie is out of the office, do you know if someone else can set up the EOL?  Mat 
 Thanks so much. 
 Karen,  Let me know if you need any additional information to set up my EOL ID.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Karla,  I assume you are referring to my NT ID, which is msmith18.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Mat 
 This is typical of the communication we are getting.  I received this at 3:30 pm... 
 Good point.  Let's assign a D to it.  Mat 
 i am trading ene like a champ!  if only i had size! 
 well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it.  there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave Enron and join other companies.  How's Kate doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in Portand.  At least there are a bunch of other shops in Houston for people who get screwed from this deal... 
 Kam,  I received my eol id, and went ahead and executed a few trades.  I'm now trying to get into TDS to views positions and such, but it doesn't look like it is set up.  I can get into TDS but there aren't any selections in the Desks dropdown box.  The tds login i used was msmith_pc.  Is this something you set up?  Mat 
 Kam,  Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.  Mat 
 Motorcross...white trashyness...sounds like fun.  i think i'm going to go home and pass out.  i'm so fucking tired.  went to the Dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers.  only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely.  oh well...i hope there's some good tv on.  sure wish i had some motorcross to attend!  Mat 
 Thanks Kam. 
 Kam,  It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.  I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.  Mat 
 Thanks. 
 Kam,  Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.  Mat 
 thanks. 
 Steve,  As I remember the output from your power forecasting model gets stored in the MOD_Load table.  However, that table does not appear have results for California for the scenario ID 25 (New Model).  Does the California data have a different scenario ID?  Mat 
 FYI, Northwest is having that airfare sale again.  Houston to White Plains...120 bucks... 
 hey, that airfare between boston and houston of 120 bucks is now available between rochester and houston. 
 Ina,  I logged out and Kobra still does not work.  Mat 
 thanks. i'm guessing most of those were hitting the aga number.... 
 Ina,  Just wanted to let you know that noone has come by to setup my Kobra.  Mat 
 Shouldn't be a problem.  I'll get it done. 
 Chris,  The last I left it with Chris and Dave W. was that I was going to compile a list of exactly what data we needed and I will include all the items you indicated.  I do have time this week, but not much because it's bid week.  Mat 
 Jody,  I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.  Mat 
 Yan,  As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.  After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated:  #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).  Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mat 
 Chris,  I stumbled across a few problems with CIG/WIC.  First, location 2776 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type "D" yet new data is scraped with flow type "T".  Let's change all D's to T's.  Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Chris,  I think we need a new pipeline for El Paso Manual Entry.  We need to enter linepack once a day.  Let's call the DRN LinePack and populate with flow type S.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Chris,  More changes............  For DRN 34585, please change the utilization value in the usage table for 4/23/01 to zero.  Then change the DRN on all of the usage data for 34585 to 34584 and delete location 34585.  In addition, please make the following utilization value changes to the usage data for DRN 34584:  4/2/01		28954 4/3/01		31401 4/4/01		31401 4/5/01		38490 4/6/01		23116 4/7/01		28674 4/8/01		31311  4/21/01		26783 4/23/01		30685  Thanks again.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Please move the file i sent you from the Testing tab to the West directory under the Pipeline tab.  I have updated it in the Testing tab so discard the version i emailed.  Thanks.  Mat

 Chris,  Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.  Mat 
 Ashley,  There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??  Mat 
 Jose,  Can you please add Zac McCorroll to the distribution list for the West temperature sheet.  Thanks.  Mat 
 I think this is all for now...of course, he should have access to all of the items within the West directories below.  Thanks.  Mat 
 The value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D.  All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).  Mat 
 I'm sorry I do not know what this is in regard to.  Could you have meant to send it to another Mat Smith? 
 Colin,  Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.  I'm available today to help any way I can.  Thanks.  Mat 
 asdfasd 
 Keith,  Take a look at this.  Mat 
 Thank you. 
 Dave,  As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Amanda,  Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.  Mat
