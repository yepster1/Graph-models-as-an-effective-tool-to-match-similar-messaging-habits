probably hit the City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day this time...  Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.  Mat 
 Make sure you take care of Dave... 
 Awesome dude!  I'll definitely be around.  Hey, maybe you can bring my wine (or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).  Mat 
 Yes, I'm scheduling for the West desk, so I need whatever software package is required.  Thanks. 
 Mi casa es su casa.  I've got plenty of room.  Hey what's this I hear about you and Heather looking for a plot of land? 
 Pablo,  Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.    Error 500--Internal Server Error From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1: 10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.   Thanks.  Mat 
 Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since they didn't give us the technical tests. 
 I need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that I don't already know. 
 Any news yet? 
 huh? 
 I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info. 
 Cool.  I actually left a message with Ted, but obviously I've heard nothing. 
 Thanks. 
 Mark,  Did we not already do this?  Mat 
 Sorry for the no call.  I was busy until about 10 pm and....well I just got interupted.   Anyway, I'll call you later...ok?   I promise.  Mat 
 Aah, thanks for the clarification. 
 Damn it!  What did I say?  Do you read your emails or what?  I want descriptions!  I want chicks.  I need a chick.  I need a really cool  chick to hang out with. 
 My response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks. 
 Seriously, you better fucking call me.  Mark's away and I'm lonely. 
 no. 
 Hey, you still coming to H-town? 
 Hey, I, for some reason, just got your email.  Anyway,  I'll try to call you later in the morning, but if you want to call me at work my # is 713-853-0472.  Talk to you soon.  Mat 
 I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how this "track" will actually affect me.  Happy hour tomorrow?  Mat 
 Jeanie,  As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be interested.  See you around,  Mat 
 Hey, are you there..............................? 
 It's funny, even the southern ones.  How was your night?  Please send e-mail to my compuserve account from now on (mds12403@cs.com).  Thanks.  Mat 
 Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.  I was thinking about old times. I can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically hear you yacking on the phone....or whispering to Jimmy.... 
 Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to refresh it manually.  It sucks....  So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.  Later.  Mat 
 Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you should so you can send me an instant message. 
 Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.................................? 
 Well, will discuss that later.  Call me whenever you want.  Mat 
 Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

 Regan,  Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's just say my plate looks to be full.  By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland. Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as well.  I'd like to know more.  Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  Later,  Mat 
 Sure, unless I'm on a flight. 
 Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9. 
 So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance.  Mat 
 Leo,  Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be happy to with a little notice.  Mat 
 Kristen,  How often do you check your cell phone and email for messages?  Mat 
 Tracy,  I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still attend these sessions.  Thank you.  Mathew Smith 
 Kristen,  Just wanted to let you know that I didn't get any emails from you last night or today. 
 Steve,  Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.  Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.  Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.  Take care,  Mat 
 Louis,  When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?  Mathew Smith 3-0472 
 Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip. 
 Lunch on Friday sounds great.  Mat 
 Steve,  I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension? Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702.  Later dude. 
 That is good to hear.  Give me a call today as you indicated.  Mat 
 FYI  How are you feeling today?  I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I=20 actually feel pretty good.  I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said I= =20 could definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the e= nd=20 of jan and his tour might be over!  still waiting to hear whether a=20 non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other year= . =20 I thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work down= =20 there.  Interesting.... anyway, I finally got signed up for the continental= =20 travel specials.  I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go to= =20 Louisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.  I'd take=20 advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its a= =20 little late to switch with somebody. =20  Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit=20 around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.  Later....=20 
 Hola, como estas?  yo estoy malo. 
 Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system. The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad. Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for you..........................Adios. 
 Matt, I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing.  I'm working this weekend so I'll give it a go.  Thanks.  Mat 
 That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.  Mat 
 Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :(  I just want to be loved....  Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call later.  I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off.  Mat 
 Brief,  You name the time and the place between 2:30 pm Friday January 12th through 12 pm Monday January 15th!  Pres  713-784-8180 h 713-853-0472 w 832-444-7702 m 
 OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

 Hey, I just wanted to pass along my phone numbers for future reference:  Office:   3-0472 Home: 713-784-8180 Cell: 832-444-7702  By the way, I finally spoke with Jennifer today.  She would like to get together with us for a few beers whenever we decide.   Mat 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Cheryl,  I will be attending the reception on Thursday for the A/A program.  Thanks.  Mathew Smith 
 Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering.  Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.  Have a nice day.  Mat 
 Hey, are you at work today? 
 Did you have fun last night? 
 Are you busy? 
 I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later. 
 Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of skiing!  I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.  Stay cool.  Mateo. 
 Who are you? 
 So tired I am.
