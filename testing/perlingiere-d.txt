 Victoria,  Now it is my turn to apologize for a late response.  Having said that, I have reviewed your remarks regarding the GISB my comments are as  follows:  Section 1.2   Transactions may be negotiated orally or online.  In either case Enron will  send a written confirmation via fax or electronic for  the trade.  I hope this helps in clearing any confusion regarding the oral designation in Section1.2.  Section 7.2 With regards ACH, I am waiting on a response from my accounting dept.  Section 13.5 Concerning jurisdiction we will agree to  New York.   Please let me have your thoughts regards these issues.

 I wanted to let  you know I am currently negotiating two Master Gas Agreements with TransCanada for the two entities listed above.  As previously discussed, credit suggests increasing  TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s  guaranty to $50MM and decreasing Enron's to the same amount.    Have you discussed TransCanada's guaranty?    Is $50MM large enough to cover your agreement?  Veronica Espinoza(66002) in credit is working with me on guaranty issues. Finally, did you receive copies of Enron's and TransCanads's guaranty?  If not, let me know I will fax same.  Their guaranty expires the end of this month.

Special Provisions  Section 1.2, Oral Transaction Procedure:  In third line of  the suggested paragraph, delete  "for purposes of Section 2.201(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code".  Section 7.5  We suggest the following language:  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

 The Guaranty is specific to the master.  In paragraph  #1 it says "...guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract....".   Also at the top of the agreement it says "...entering into and Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date...."  DP 
 We cannot assign this agreement to HPL.  Although the billing was in error, the transaction was confirmed under, and rightfully so Enron North America. We of course will correct our records and future billing statements.  We are sorry for any inconvenience.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

 H.L. Jacobson ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company  Further to our discussion Friday, concerning certain confirmations for ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company, I have determined the following: first, ExxonMobil  or HPL may confirm transactions as agreed at the time of the trade; second, in the event HPL confirms,  we have made changes to our system which should prevent the  issuance of  GTCs for Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing Company trades, with the exception of "online" trades, therefore causing future trades relating to these agreements to attach to one of two contracts under discussion  Friday.   Please bear in mind these changes may not be in effect until the end of next week.  With regards to confidentiality language contained in the confirm, we are unable to amend this at this time.  Finally, concerning the August 8th letter (confirmation) provided by you in the meeting, we are in agreement with same.  We trust the foregoing meets with your approval.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have regarding this matter.  Regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

Please advise.  The following representations and warranties shall apply to Transactions under the stated conditions:  (i) if Company is Buyer, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced (a) within the state of Texas and will not have been commingled with other Gas which is or may be sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in such manner which would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (b) outside of the state of Texas with any transportation on an interstate pipeline having been conducted under Section 311 (a)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and (ii) if Company is Seller and the Delivery Point(s) for the Transaction are not interstate interconnections, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that none of the Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized outside the state or sold to another party which will subsequently sell, consume, transport or otherwise use the Gas outside the State where such event would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.

 In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.  If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.  Dp

 I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Kathleen,  Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila requested the attached drafts.  Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993) between ENA and Aquila.  Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between Enron and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not included.  I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.  Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer. There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.  Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or comments about ProLiance.

 Nancy,  Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a "writing" and to have been "signed".  For all transactions under the GISB, a written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  "Oral" on the first page.  I am checking on the status of the term deal.

 I have been in touch with Mr.  Woodford today.   This is my first day back from Turkey Day vacation.  The dogs are good.  I packed them up and drove 9 hours to Ark to visit the folks.  Geronimo was very good.  I was surprised, although he was a little much for my Dad.  How is the baby?  Have you adjusted?  Have the dogs adjusted?  The luncheon was just OK.  I thought last year was better with regards to food and clothes.  River Oaks CC did not live up to the Junior League in my opinion.   Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Jeff Hodge requested that I forward the following collateral language for your review. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  [4.6.] Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold.  If at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should exceed $______, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal to the Termination Payment in excess of $______ (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______), or such other collateral as may be reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.  The Letter of Credit or other collateral shall be delivered within two Business Days of the date of such notice.  On a Monthly basis, such Letter of Credit may be increased or reduced correspondingly to the amount of such excess Termination Payment (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______).  For purposes of this Section [4.6], the calculation of "Termination Payment" shall include all amounts owed but not yet paid by one Party to the other Party whether or not such amounts are then due, for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.

 The Master Sale Spot  with Southern Union Company is still active on our system and thus has not been terminated.   Because this is old paper, we can replace  same with a new Master Sale Spot terminate it,  issue a newer version or prepare a GISB.    Does Southern no longer wish to trade under the Spot? .  Let me know how you want to trade (i.e. short or long term, firm etc. and I will prepare the agreement.  I need the exact name of the company and a contact, phone number.  DP
