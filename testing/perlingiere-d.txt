 Stacy,  Currently I have pending on my desk a GISB from you however, ENA's special provisions are not included.  Also, a draft of a Master agreement was sent to Markwest this summer.  Can you give me an update on the status of the purposed draft?   With regards to the GISB, we can discuss ENA's special provisions at your convenience.  Please let me have your thoughts.

 I have some questions regarding Jennifer's e-mail attached below.  Is this interruptible? Is this a CES contract?    Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp. Legal Department 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 dperlin@enron.com Phone 713-853-7658 Fax  713-646-3490 
 In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.  If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.  Dp 
 In addition to the new contract,  I will need to re-confirm the deals from the RB Robertson agreement.  Do you have that info?  Thanks!   Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Cary,  Thanks for your e-mail.   Your suggestion to rephrase the second sentence of number 6 is acceptable with one change.

 Kathleen,  Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila requested the attached drafts.  Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993) between ENA and Aquila.  Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between Enron and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not included.  I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.  Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer. There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.  Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or comments about ProLiance.

 Nancy,  Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a "writing" and to have been "signed".

 Jeff Hodge requested that I forward the following collateral language for your review. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

If at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should exceed $______, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal to the Termination Payment in excess of $______ (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______), or such other collateral as may be reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.  The Letter of Credit or other collateral shall be delivered within two Business Days of the date of such notice.  On a Monthly basis, such Letter of Credit may be increased or reduced correspondingly to the amount of such excess Termination Payment (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______).  For purposes of this Section [4.6], the calculation of "Termination Payment" shall include all amounts owed but not yet paid by one Party to the other Party whether or not such amounts are then due, for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.
