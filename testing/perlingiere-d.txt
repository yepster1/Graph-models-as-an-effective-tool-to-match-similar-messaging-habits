 Beth,  We will agree to this version with the following changes:  "Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable to take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such Delivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term "Transporter" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."

 Gary,  Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?  In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:  We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming party.  Section 13.5  NY law is fine.  Our netting language is a stated below:  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.  Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to one year.    Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak to someone in your office for credit information.   Best regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Beth,  My last e-mail should have read as follows ending with "volumes". =20  Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is=20 purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the =01&Repurchasers=018= ) to=20 whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).    The parti= es=20 further agree that the term =01&Transporter=018 when used in this Contract,= =20 including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any=20 company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agr= ee=20 that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such=20 Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the= =20 same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any su= ch=20 Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes.  =20  In the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like= =20 this Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to= =20 section 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are=20 placed in the line,  2 will be made up by the transporter  the cost is=20 Enrons, and 10 would be delivered to NEGM.   And so the  opposite holds for= =20 NEGM.  If 10 could not be accepted by NEGM, its transporter would respond= =20 accordingly, and NEGM would be responsible for the cost.  Enron's  concern is with NEGM's desire to claim force majeure as a result o= f=20 an event by its customer downstream.  Force majeure must  take place at the= =20 delivery point..=20  Hope this helps!  Have a great weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.
