Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir= ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid= ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of= commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a= dditional acres of low density residential.

 Jerilyn,  Call or email with additional data requests.  Phillip 713-853-7041 
 Kay,  I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.  On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.  Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house. We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.  Keith 
 Jacques,  Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.  Phillip 
 Matt,  Make sure this is included in your long term forecast. 
 Jay,  I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.  We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.  They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location.  You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041.  Thanks for your help.  Phillip 
 Barry,  Mike and I are going to meet with John L. at 2:30 to officially work out the details of Mike's succession as desk head.  We will probably announce to the group by the end of the week.  Phillip 
 Michael,  I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  It was worth a try.  Phillip 
 Please add the following names to the mailing list:  Mike Grigsby, Frank Ermis, Keith Holst, Matt Smith, Janie Tholt 
  Mike,  I sent Leslie a note to include you and others on the desk on the distribution list. 
  Please approve Ina Rangel for a corporate American Express.  Phillip Allen 
 Richard,  I hope your party was a success.  Sorry I could not attend.  Stay in touch.  Phillip 
 Ina,  I will be on vacation July 31 - August 3.  Please mark the calendar.  Phillip 
 Jay,  Can you set up one more simulated account with access to all products for the west desk.  Thank you, Phillip Allen 
 Jay,  My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.  Thank you, Phillip 
 Bill,  Have not received the forms yet.  I will confirm receipt.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  Are the books and VAR set up for simulated trading?  We began doing trades on the user id's set up by jay webb.  Phillip 
 Jay,  Final request and I will leave you alone.  Need one more gas only id.  Phillip 
  Hunter,  Here is Portland's weekly fundamental presentation.  It might give you some good ideas.  How was ECON 5100?  Phillip 
  Bill,  Here is the information outstanding from our conversation yesterday:  1.	Assessed value for the Leander land - $632,000 2.	Mortgage on residence - Cendant Mortgage, Loan # 2328912 3.	EIN for Bishops Corner, L.P. - 76 068 5666 4.	 I will fax you statements from various accounts  Let me know what else I can do to be ready to turn around the invitation letter.  I am pulling together all the organizational documents for the partnership.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:  Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.  If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.  The amortization schedule is attached.   Phillip 
 Greg,  I have been working with Bill Montez.  I furnished a personal financial statement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.  I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let me know what else I need to do.  I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1".  Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case?  Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.  Talk to you soon.  Phillip 
 I did not receive the 2nd quarter trend report by email.  My email address is pallen70@hotmail.com.  In the future, I would prefer a hard copy and the ability to download from the website.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 The account numbers you needed are below:  1.	1st Community Credit Union- 1109870 2.	1st State Bank - 102255 
 Jeanie,  Here is a letter about why Frank should be promoted. 
 Greg here are my questions regarding the cedar park deal. 
 10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS) 
 Heather,  This is exactly what we need.  Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.  In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Jacques,  Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?  I haven't heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb.  I keep leaving messages.  Phillip 
 Ina,  Please mark me down for vacation on August 1 through August 3.  Phillip 
 Mike,  Here is my first pass at midyear reviews.    Let me know if you want me to draft something for Monique.  I will make sure that Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are reviewed appropriately.  That just leaves Susan.  Phillip 
 Call Barry Tycholiz 
 Griff,  Can you please accommodate this request?  Phillip 
 Dexter,  Hopefully Griff Gray has sent you the information on your id and password by now.  It should be good through January.  Please email or call if any problems.  Phillip 
  Janie,  Do you want to work with regulatory to make sure we can comply? 
 Tim,  Is something wrong with the database?  It appears that the iso load, hour ahead intertie data, and the northwest hydro info has not been updated since 7/25.  Is this just a problem on our end?  Let me know when you get a chance.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 I am glad we finally heard from Kevin Kolb.  I would like to close the book on the stagecoach.  I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday.  I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible.  Sorry to hear about your wife's condition.  She will be in our prayers.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  If your schedule permits, 4pm or later today would work for us.  Phillip 
 Ed,  How does Ellie like the ranch?  Is she adjusting OK?  Phillip Allen 
  Francis,  Here are the files we need in excel.  Thank you for your help.  Phillip 
 Jean,  Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  Here are some ideas:  1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck) 2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.  Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.  Phillip 
 John,  I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.  I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.  See you on Monday.  Phillip 
 Tim,  Is there a website maintained by the Corp of Engineers or other source that reports real time hourly flows and generation from the major dams? I remember one from several years ago but I can only find daily averages on the west power site.  Phillip

 Ceci,  I received the list of properties you mailed.  Thank you very much.  I would like to stay updated on the market in Hood River and the surrounding areas in Washington as well.  I would be interested in lots as well as homes.  In case you don't still have it, my address is 8855 Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen

  Mark,  The planned mountain bike activity is on Beaver Creek Mountain.  Do you kno= w what kind of trails are there?  There is a break on Saturday after lunch.= The trails at Vail sound great.  Hunter and I would definitely be up for = trying them out.   Let's set it up.  Let me know if you can book a side tri= p or if you want me to try.  Thanks,  Phillip=20 
  Ceci,  I would like to stay current on listings under $225.  As an alternative, I would be interested in finding a lot with city utilities to build a small home(<1500 sf).  I am not in a hurry.  I would just like to follow the market and hopefully find a great deal if I am patient.  Thanks for your help.  Phillip Allen 
 David,  For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.  Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.  Phillip 
 Heather,  Did you attach the file to this email? 
 Michelle,  Please send the revised agreements when you get a chance.  I spoke to Mike B. this afternoon and agreed to move the deadline to Friday, August 17, 2001.  Phillip 
 Vail sounds good.  If we are only going downhill our legs shouldn't be too = wiped out after the morning.  We will be on rented bikes, but I'm sure we c= an keep them for the day. 
 Jean,  Dave Forster is out of town.  Do you think we will be able to shoot, edit, and add music to the video using Dwight's camera?  Phillip 
 Jean,  Please have Melissa send down the CD or give me a call and I will come get it.  Thanks, Phillip 
 Kirk,  Andy Lewis, a director on the Central Desk, has agreed to participate as a content SME.  I plan on being heavily involved in reviewing the content as well.  Phillip 
  Michelle,  I have executed the Warranty Deed, First Amendment, and the Escrow Agreement.  I am waiting for the agreement that replaces paragraph 7D in the original Escrow Agreement.  Once you email me that document, I will execute it and overnight all 4 documents to you.  Phillip 
 Greg,  Here is the story with Bobinchuck's bonds.  They are being placed privately with a fund of investors.  The interest is 7.7% with no credit enhancement.  I guess Agape is the 501-c-3 nonprofit.  That's why he has flexibility with the timing.  Philip 
 Richard,  Here is the power point presentation.  Also, the web address below contains the music we want to use.        <http://www.theadversary.com/music/music.htm>  If you right click on a song and choose Save Target As you can save the songs to a file.  I will see you tomorrow morning at 8 AM.  You can reach me at 713-853-7041(w) or 713-463-8626(h)  Phillip Allen 
 Why is the body shop being closed?  Why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes? 
 Jeanie,  Can you send me a list of performance review that I have not completed?  Thanks, Phillip 
 Rick,  Here is the table to insert during Oxley's introduction.  Maybe you could flash to this screen while he speaks.  If you can read my notes, the second Oxley intro has a better audio reference to the skewed distribution.  That might be useful.   Can you send me an email confirming receipt.  Phillip 
 Erik,  All of the desk heads are leaving for an offsite this afternoon through this weekend.  Monday would be better.  I would like to schedule meetings for you with several people on the gas floor.  I will have Ina Rangel arrange this for Monday afternoon.  Phillip 
 Kirk,  Berney's last name is spelled AUCOIN.  His number is ext. 34784.  Ed McMichael's number is ext. 37657.  Andy Lewis will be the subject matter expert along with myself.  Phillip 
 Chris,  Can you use your connections to request access to the East Power website for the following:  Hunter Shively Mike Grigsby Scott Neal John Arnold Tom Martin Phillip Allen Jim Schwieger  Thanks,  Phillip 
 Greg,  This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.  Here is a list of questions:  1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects. 2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186) 3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?    This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.  Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip 
 Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution list. 
 Jacques,  Hope all is fine with your wife.  I would like to get the Stagecoach release finalized.  Kevin Kolb is waiting for our comments on the latest draft he faxed you. If it looks ok to you let's sign it and move on.  Phillip 
 I have been riding my bike to work a couple of times each week and lifting with Matt.  I thought you came in later. 
  Here is the file of historical midmarkets for Sumas and Malin.  Call me if you have any questions.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 
  Jeff,  JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.  Phillip 
 Greg,  Please call or email with an update on Bank One and permitting process.  Phillip 
 Aplusmath.com    Creates flashcards and worksheets for +-*/ 
 Jeanie,  If an employee voluntarily terminates, how long do they have to exercise their options.  Hypothetically, of course.  Phillip 
 Any word on the release agreement?  Have you sent all the comments back to Kevin Kolb?  I can't tell if they are the hold-up or if we are. I am going to be in San Marcos next Friday.  It would be good if we could have things signed by then so we can exchange funds. Please email with status update.  Phillip 
 Have you heard anything from Bank One today? 
 Mike,  How did the school board meeting go last night?  Phillip 
 Jeff Gosset is going to pull the P&L packet from the days with the biggest discrepancy and we will go from there. 
 Jeff,  I got your voice mail about the school board.  That is good news.  Let me know when the closing is rescheduled.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I got your voice mail about the school board approval.  That's good news.  Let me know when the closing is rescheduled.  Phillip 
 According to Jacques, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, Kevin Kolb.  I just spoke to Kevin.  The Kuo's have been away on vacation.  He is going to try and get things finalized this week.  It sounds like they want to sign and exchange money in person.  This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probably be  the most convenient time.  I will let you know when I hear more from Kevin Kolb.  Phillip 
 Ina,  Gracie finally sent the CPE credit information.  Thanks for staying on top of it.  Is there somewhere online that I can find my YTD wages and taxes withheld.  I know it was on the pay stub from last week, but I threw that one away before I realized I needed the info.  If I can't find it online, can you get payroll to print out another check stub from 8/31.  I need to do some income tax calculations.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 Jeff,  According to Kevin Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo's today to give a final blessing to the release.  He doesn't foresee any issues.  If they are ok with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person.  I will be in San Marcos this weekend.  Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well for me.  He is proposing that time to the Kuo's.  How does your schedule look?  It would be nice to finally put this behind us.  Any word on a closing date for Leander?  Phillip 
 They cannot meet on Saturday.  I will probably meet them in Columbus on Monday or Tuesday.  I will let you know when.  Phillip 
 That should be ok.  I will give you a call on Tuesday morning.  A  Still no word on the Leander closing? 
 Jacques,  I sent you a fax of Kevin Kolb's comments on the release.  The payoff on the note would be $36,248 ($36090(principal) + $158 (accrued interest)). This is assuming we wrap this up on Tuesday.  Please email to confirm that their changes are ok so I can set up a meeting on Tuesday to reach closure.  Phillip 
 Mac,  The IRS address for estimated payments is:  PO Box 970001;  St. Louis, MO 63197-0001  Keith  PS:  Please confirm receipt of this message. 
 Jacques,  Once you make the changes to the release, please fax a copy to Kevin Kolb.  I am going to try and meet Pauline Kuo on Tuesday or Wednesday to wrap things up.  In addition to the release, I will need the guarantee and a release of lien for the smaller note.  I will speak to you on Monday.  Hope things are going well with your wife.  Phillip 
 That's great.  Your guys seem fired up about this program.  We need something like this in Houston to boost morale.  It makes me miss Portland. 
 Can you send me a schedule of meetings?  Is there one today?  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Did you get a chance to look at the release?  Drop me a note when you can.  Phillip 
 Thanks.  I am waiting to speak to Pauline Kuo to schedule a time and place to meet her this week.  Hopefully we can meet Tuesday or Wednesday.  I will swing by your office to pick up the documents.  Phillip 
 Mike,  Can you send me a status update when you get a chance.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Yevgeny,  Can you send me a schedule of meetings.  I don't know if we have one today or not.   I have a doctors appointment this afternoon so I can't make it today.  Phillip 
 Yevgeny,  In light of this mornings events, most of the trading floor is leaving.  So we will have to do the meeting tomorrow.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language "Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 John,  Do you still want to get together this week?  Phillip 
 Jeff,  The attorney's are done with the documents.  I have a call in with Pauline to schedule a meeting to sign them.  Most likely in Columbus.  I am waiting to hear from her.  Phillip 
 Greg or Darrell:  Did you get an official rejection or invitation on the New Braunfels project?  Phillip 
 Greg,  What was the official word on New Braunfels?  Phillip 
 Mery,  The target audience document looks fine.  Phillip 
 Congratulations.  Glad to hear you made it.  You are in elite company. 
  My guess at your time is 11 hrs 10 minutes.  Was I close? 
 Don,  Jeff Gosset runs the risk management group.  I spoke to him about including a module on how the books work.  He liked the concept and is willing to sit down with you to discuss further.  His number is X37306.  He is expecting a call to set up a meeting.  Phillip 
 Can you approve this invoice or show me how to get into this system?  Thank you,  Phillip 
  John,  The spreadsheet below ("Valuation Summary..") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements.  Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday. I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.  It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Jeff,  In light of the puny VAR allotments attributed to the simulated trading participants, we have decided to graduate Matt Smith from the exercise.  Please advise Kimat Singla it will no longer be necessary to calculate a simulated book for Matt Smith.  Please use his COB 9/25/01 P&L as his official score for this exercise and post his total on the High Score table under the initials MDS.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 This is a list of common mistakes.  However, as the group works together to create exercises and scenarios for the simulation many additional ideas will be generated.  I don't want to hold up this document.  I just want everyone to be aware that it is not all inclusive.  Phillip 
 Kirk,  This document is fine. 
 Kirk,  I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.  Phillip 
 Sounds good.  This email address goes to my work.  If you finish on Friday or over the weekend, please send to pallen70@hotmail.com <mailto:pallen70@hotmail.com>.  Thanks,  Phillip Allen 
 I like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week.  I like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables.  Plus  these seem a little bigger.  I like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen.  The kitchen should be bigger.  You could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen. 
    Greg,  I forgot to mention the Perrin Oaks ideas.  They are on the attached memo.  Have a good weekend.  Phillip 
   Mery,  Please email me back with a location for tomorrow's meeting.  Phillip 
 Greg,  I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed t= he deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreem= ent.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What w= ill happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since = the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute= an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.  You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me = previously.  Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not= looking at old numbers.  Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of tru= e costs and expected loan.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Kirk,  What is the deal with this boat trip?  Seems too extravagant and wasteful.  I am not comfortable with this.  Can't we just have a small happy hour once the project is complete?  Phillip 
 Gary,  Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?  In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.  The dimensions of the house have not changed.  The quote given last week was over $26,000.  Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?  I need help understanding this increase.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 
 Richard,  I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.  I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.  Thank you for your help.  Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 
 Greg,  I won't be in the office on Thursday.  I am getting my knee scoped.  I will be at home in the afternoon. 713-463-8626.  If you need to email me use pallen70@hotmail.com.  I will be in the office on Friday.  Phillip 
 Monica,  The outlines you just dropped off are fine.  Phillip 
 I will be there tomorrow, but I have a bunch of rehab exercises to do for my knee.  I probably won't be much of a partner for a couple more weeks.

 Yes, I will attend the meeting. 
 Karen,  I interviewed Agustin Leon and Zoya Raynes.  Here are my comments:  Agustin Leon:  Has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis.  Programming and language skills.  If not a trader could be an asset to research group.  Zoya Raynes:  Has already been through Salomon's rotational program.  Her interest lean more towards marketing than trading.  Seems very talented.  I would recommend both candidates for further consideration.  Phillip 
 Tim,  Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.  Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 I am going to be in a meeting with Accenture on Friday from 9am until 3pm.  So I can't meet with Paul Margraves.  Have him call me directly and I will set something up.  Phillip 
 Bob,  I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.  Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.  I  Phillip  http://www.trec.state.tx.us/formsrulespubs/forms/forms-contracts.asp 
 I like the cedar t-111 version better.  Why don't you tell this shop teacher not to be to comfortable and that you will be taking his job in two years. 
 Randy,  Why is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?  Were these positions created in the last week or so?  Can you print a forwards detail and move these deals into FT-PGE?  Do not just transfer at mid market.  Please move the deals.  Phillip 
 John,  It would be a good idea to pull together the desk heads to air out concerns.  We all have questions and don't feel we have all the facts to answer the questions employees are asking.  The sooner the better.  Phillip 
 If you get the info from the owner this afternoon, please send it to pallen70@hotmail.com. 
 Thanks for the update. 
 I will try and find my title policy this evening. 
  Renee,  Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?  Thanks for you help.  Phillip 
  Thanks 
 These are fine. 
  Michelle,  Here are my comments:  Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the "Utility Lines".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.  Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.  Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.  I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.  The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.  Phillip 
 Can you fax me the rent roll?  713-646-2391. Also please send the unit mix and square footages again.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 Adrianne,  I cannot download his resume.  Please resend.  Phillip 
 Brent,  Please call me so we can do a 15 minute phone interview regarding your interest in the trading track program.  Phillip Allen West gas trading 713-853-7041 
 Left message and sent email.  I will let you know as soon as I have spoken to him. 
 Please send more details regarding this meeting 
 Adrianne,  I spoke to Brent D.  I would recommend that he is given a chance to interview for the program.  Phillip 
 Can we meet from 10am-11am instead? 
 Greg,  I would rather sign and fax copies of the necessary contracts then follow up with originals through the mail.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  I need to pull together the Bishops Corner organization documents so we can close on the bank loan.  Did Keith and I take the originals or did we leave them with you?  I know we still need to issue the shares for the GP.  Please drop me a note.  Phillip Allen 
    Greg,  I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.  Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?  I will follow up with a phone call.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets. 
 Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?    I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?  Phillip 
 Mac,  This looks good.  I won't know exactly what my cash position is until mid January.  I will let you know.  Thanks,  Keith 
 Here is our forecast 
 Is this the weekly fundamentals report produced by Tim Heizenrader's group?= In Houston, we have been receiving the report on Tuesday afternoon via em= ail before the fundamentals meeting in Portland.  How can distribution thro= ugh or administrative assistants be more efficient? =20  The administrative assistant for the West gas desk is Ina Rangel.  Her loca= tion is EB3210.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 
 Bob,  I found the warranty deed but I could not find the title policy.  I will call the title company that we used to get a copy today.  Phillip 
 Andy,  I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go.  Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online.  If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.  Phillip 
 Renee,  I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last Thursday.  I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be made off-cycle. However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit.  Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Carlos,  I faxed you a copy of the contract to sell the property in Leander.  The title company is Chicago Title Company in Austin.  Their address is 1501 S Mopac, Suite 130, Austin, TX 78746.  Wendy Butters is the contact person.  Her number is (512)480-8353.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Thanks for pulling together the copies of the organization documents.  Have you had a chance to gather the title work? Call or email when you get a chance.  Phillip 
 Renee,  Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Richard,  I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  Thank you for your help.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 
 Jerry,  I had a couple of questions about the exchange.  1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership? 2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest? 3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Bob,  Let me know how I can help with the variance application.  Phillip 
 Renee,  I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.  Scott Neal and Tom Martin would like to attend as well.  This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us.  Please let me know what time we could meet.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.  Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.  Phillip 
 Greg,  I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office.  The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold.  Let me know what you think of this property.  Also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.  Phillip 
 Jim,  Take a look at this spreadsheet.  I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices.  Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties?  The Roma deal looks much better.  Phillip 
 Mery,  This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting.  We should be able to work with this.  Phillip 
 Jim,  I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.  Phillip 
 Bob,  The application for the variance states that I applied for a permit on October 29th and was rejected.  Do the discussions with the building inspector constitute denial.  Phillip 
 Steve,  I need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.  Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.  Please get back to me soon.  Phillip 
 Tim,  Have you considered reducing the scope or terminating the Accenture project to conserve cash?  Where are we in terms of %complete?  Phillip 
 I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.  The call's I am short are way out of the money.  The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short.  I would consider closing those positions.  I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.  Please forward this email to Steve.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  Jacques Craig will draw up a release.  What is the status on the quote from Wade?  Phillip 
 When can we reschedule the meeting regarding phantom stock deferral.  Any day except Thursday would work.  Phillip Allen 
 I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020.  Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?  Phillip 
 I am still using my home Nortel VPN access. 
 What are the specifics of those bonds are they insured what are they rated?  Can you work up a ladder from 2015-2026?  Shouldn't I buy more than just one or two issues? 
 Let's start with $1 million. 
 Bob,  I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be = on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t= he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th= at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20  On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su= ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f= orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.= You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new = space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing= play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord= ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for = a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to= add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed= room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un= til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin= g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway = the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be = brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche= n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b= e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b= ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di= ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining = room would be the better idea.  I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp= loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi= ng in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try= and sketch out these ideas.  Phillip 
 Please review. =20   Greg,  After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as= of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock.  There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,= section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indi
