ost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable)  What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?  Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.  Why is profit only 4%?  Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.  What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost?  Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?  Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?  What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage would only be 1.16.  Talk to you this afternoon.  Phillip 
 Grif,  Please provide a temporary id  Phillip 
 John,  Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still wants to receive this payment.  Phillip 
 Reagan,  Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.  Specific features include:  Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs Wood stairs Two story porches on front and rear Granite counters in kitchens and baths Tile floors in upstairs baths Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers) Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths Solid wood interior doors Windows fully trimmed Crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side  Undecided items include:  Vinyl or Aluminum windows Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 sides   I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read. The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a box with a simple roof line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.  Phillip 
 How am I to send them the money for the silent second?  Regular mail, overnight, wire transfer?  I don't see how their bank will make the funds available by Friday unless I wire the money.  If that is what I need to do please send wiring instructions. 
 Greg,  Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?  Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.  Phillip 
 keith holst sent you an email with the details. 
 Jacques,  The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required.  Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip 
 Steve,  Try bmckay@enron.com or Brad.McKay@enron.com 
 Larry,  Jacques has been working with Claudia.  I will check his progress this morning and let you know.  Phillip 
 Greg,  just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.  I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city.  I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.  We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.  Talk to you later.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.  I think that was the last issue to resolve.  Phillip 
 Ina,  Can you help me approve this request?  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents need to be completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if there is a reason I should not do this.  Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.  Phillip 
 The topic will the the western natural gas market.  I may have overhead slides.  I will bring handouts. 
 Larrry,  I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list that I need further clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up.  Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean.  What is your inclination?  Call as soon as you have a chance to review.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here is the rentroll.  My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special reasons?  It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine. I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good idea whether the sale is going through.  Phillip 
 I also need to know the base salaries of Jay Reitmeyer and Monique Sanchez. They are doing the same job as Matt. 
 Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned.  I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?  Thank you for looking into this issue.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Somehow my email account lost the rentroll you sent me on Tuesday.  Please resend it and I will roll it for this week this morning.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I am in the office today.  Any isssues to deal with for the stagecoach?  Phillip 
 Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.  Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.  Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward.  Phillip 
 Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.  The summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions. 
 Jacques,  George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.  My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap.  Call me with your thoughts.  Phillip 
 George,  I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send it this morning.  We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more advantageous to convey the partnership.  Also, I would like to speak to Hugo today.  I didn't find a Quattro Engineering in Buda.  Can you put me in contact with him.  Talk to you later.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here is a rentroll for this week.  What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(this week)= 300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate clearly.  #2 still owe deposit?  #9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.  Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you next week.  In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy the property.  I will keep you informed.  Phillip 
 Please approve Mike Grigsby for Bloomberg.  Thank You, Phillip Allen 
 Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like to proceed and develop the property.  My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with. Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about either.  I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.  Phillip 
 Reagan,  Here is the cost estimate and proforma prepared by George and Larry.  I am faxing the site plan, elevation, and floor plans.      Phillip 
 I just refaxed. Please confirm receipt 
 I faxed you the signed amendment. 
 Daryl,  Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.  This file was prepared by the builder/developer.   The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are in Austin.  Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.  Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 
 Al,  I was not going to do the MS this year.  Thanks for the offer though.  All is well here.  We went to Colorado last week and the kids learned to ski.  Work is same as always. How are things going at New Power?  Is there any potential?  Phillip 
 John,  Did you put Frank Hayden up to this?  If this decision is up to me I would= =20 consider authorizing Mike G., Frank E., Keith H. and myself to trade west= =20 power.  What do you think?  Phillip 
 George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows:  Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million  Land                      1.15  Interim Financing               .85  Common Areas                     .80  Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.  After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.  Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives.  Phillip 
 The insurance company is:  Central Insurance Agency, Inc 6000 N., Lamar P.O. Box 15427 Austin, TX 78761-5427  Policy #CBI420478  Contact:  Jeanette Peterson  (512)451-6551  The actual policy is signed by Vista Insurance Partners.  Please try and schedule the appraiser for sometime after 1 p.m. so my Dad can walk him around.  I will be out of town on Tuesday.  What else do we need to get done before closing?  Phillip

 I have not received the aircard 300 yet.  Phillip 
 Don,  I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to Mark Whitt in Denver.  Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.  Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand why your people don't contact the desk directly.  Phillip 
 Please find attached the pro formas for the project in San Marcos.  Thanks again. 
 Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.  Phillip 
 George,  I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.  Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number.  Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning.  Phillip 
 George,  The numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that I am using. Here are the two files I used.       Phillip 
 Attached  are two files that illustrate the following:  As prices rose, supply increased and demand decreased.  Now prices are beginning to fall in response these market responses. 
 You can fax it anytime.  But I saved the spreadsheets from the previous estimates.  What will be different in the fax? 
 Tomorrow is fine.  Talk to you then.  Phillip 
 John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and aud
