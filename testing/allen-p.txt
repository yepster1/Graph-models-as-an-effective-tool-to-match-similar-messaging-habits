 Dexter,  You should receive a guest id shortly.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:  1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period.  What is going on?  2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?   Here is a file for 12/08. 
 Jed,  I understand you have been contacted regarding a telephone interview to discuss trading opportunities at  Enron.  I am sending you this message to schedule the interview.  Please call or email me with a time that would be convenient for you.  I look forward to speaking with you.  Phillip Allen West Gas Trading pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 
 Griff,  Can you accomodate Dexter as we have in the past.  This has been very helpful in establishing a fair index at Socal Border.  Phillip  Please cc me on the email with a guest password.  The sooner the better as bidweek is underway. 
 Patti,  This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to be an interviewer?  Phillip 
 Nick,  There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call and he will fill you in on the details of the program.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  #32 and #29 are fine.  #28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.  Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent you this morning.  Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.    Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here is a rentroll for this week.  I still have questions on #28,#29, and #32. 
 Larry,  I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project.  They need the following:  Financial statements plus last two years tax returns. Builders resume listing similar projects  The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday.  If we are interested in his loan, he would want to  come see the site. If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along.   You can send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).  The broker is Jim Murnan.  His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call him and send the documents to him directly.  It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership agreement.  I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon as possible.  Please email or call with  an update.   Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.  Did we collect these overages?  Let's discuss further?  Remember these bills were paid in July and August.  The usage dates are much earlier.  I have the bills but I can get them to you if need be.  Philip 
 By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15  As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number.  The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.  "Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson, a trader. "It makes the market for natural gas."  But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality.  "It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting," McGill said.  As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street.  Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices.  "It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.  In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.  Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes.  Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared.  "We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.  But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.  "There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.   Hot topic  Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed.  The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well.  The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.  "It's the talk of the town here," he said.  A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers.  But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter.  There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.  But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets.  "It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.  Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world.   Setting the price  In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices.  The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use.  There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas.  But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time.  As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers.  Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter.  Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.  Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.  Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.  But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.  "I was getting worried," he said.  Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.   Just passing through  Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers.  Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.  Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy.  Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter.  Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.  Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs.  On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.  "Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It's time to consider some changes."

 need help. 
 Jeff,  Here is a recent rentroll.  I understand another looker went to the property.  I want to hear the feedback no matter how discouraging. I am in Portland for the rest of the week.  You can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679.  My understanding was that you would be overnighting some closing statements for Leander on Friday.  Please send them to my house (8855 Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055).  Call me if necessary.  Phillip 
 Larry,  The wire should go out today.  I am in Portland but can be reached by cell phone 713-410-4679.  Call me if there are any issues.  I will place a call to my attorney to check on the loan agreement.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Why did so many tenants not pay this week?  #12 95 #21 240 #27 120 #28 260 #33 260  Total 975  It seems these apartments just missed rent.  What is up?  Other questions:  #9-Why didn't they pay anything?  By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent should have been due on 12/12 of $220.  #3-Why did they short pay? 
 Kristin,  Thank you for the California update.  Please continue to include me in all further intellegence reports regarding the situation in California.  Phillip 
 Andrea,  Please resend the first three resumes.  Phillip 
 Bob,  Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the plans.  As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?  Do we need plasma screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.  Phillip

 Lucy,  The apartments that have new tenants since December 15th are: 1,2,8,12,13,16,20a,20b,25,32,38,39.  Are we running an apartment complex or a motel?  Please update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me this afternoon.  Phillip 
 Larry,  Do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million.  Phillip 
 Thanks for representing Matt.  Phillip 
 George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas:  1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.  2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip 
 Lucy,  Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather.  You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write something today.    Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting.  Phillip 
 We do not understand our VAR.  Can you please get us all the detailed reports and component VAR reports that you can produce?  The sooner the better.  Phillip

Are you too busy to look at this project?  As I mentioned I would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding board for the key issues.  Please email or call.

 Questions about 12/29 rentroll:  There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?  Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For what periods?   What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.  I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this right?  Has the deposit been made yet?   A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.  Phillip

 Gentlemen,  I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.  I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I hope to pull that together this afternoon.  I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss these procedures in advance.  Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.  Phillip

 Jim,  I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.  I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.  Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.   Phillip Allen 
 Jeff,  Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility connections?  Other rezoning costs?  What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights?  What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.  Phillip 
 Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:  1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months.  2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include:  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less.  3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted.   Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip

 Liane,  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.   I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen

 John,  Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 2005.  They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday and Thursday.  Phillip 
 George,  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project:  Ownership Structure  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)?  Who owns the land? improvements?  Who holds the various loans?  Is the land collateral?  Investment  What happens to initial investment?  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule?  Investment Return  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed?  Debt  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan?  Improvement  Construction  Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.  Terms of each loan?  Uses of Funds  How will disbursements be made?  By whom?  What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors?  Reports to track expenses vs plan?  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits?  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits?  Design and Construction  When will design be complete?  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting?  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.  Phillip 
 George,  Here sales numbers from Reagan:     As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date.  Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen 
 Jeff,  What is up with Burnet?  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and I will input. 
 Brenda,  I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October.  I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval.  I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip 
 please remove my name and information from the registered user list.  Do not sell my information.  Phillip Allen

 Jeff,  I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening. I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?  What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember we have to get Brenda happy.  Phillip 
 9/8  9/7  diff  Socal  36,600  37,200  -600  NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250  San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500   The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and sold 800 Socal. 
 why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO? What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO? 
 Jeff,  You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch?  I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.  Phillip
