 On Dec. 21 CRC called and wanted to resume deliveries at the Mid-C (they are delivering to us).  I'm assuming this is OK.  Let me know otherwise.  Sean 
  Hey there!  How's it going?  I understand you guys stole one of our marketers.  That's ok, I'll forgive you.  Things are insanely boring here.  Basically we are in a wait mode, probably, I think, until February.  This is the first time in 5 years I haven't had to worry about P&L and I have to say it's pretty weird.  It's nice sleeping in though.  So supposedly we have 14 potential suitors. You've probably heard of the banks, and I've also heard Reliant is putting together a bid.  THAT would be interesting.  We laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people.  Bad timing.  Plus, when we laid off Enron Broadband folks, they got a six month severance package, and EBB didn't make any money, and in fact lost a substantial amount.  Then Enron lays off people on our floor, which has made a phenomenal amount of money, and gives them basically $4,000 taxed at 48%.  Life is not fair.  It's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry.  I think the California debacle, then Enron (now Calpine), is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward.  Credit is going to become more and more an issue, especially towards the back of the curve.  It's interesting, I remember 5 years ago the prediction was, when it was all said and done, there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country.  Looks like it's heading that way.  So are you going to Europe?  Sounds like fun.  If it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while, I might go on vacation for a couple of weeks, maybe Hawaii.  Well, I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee.  I hope everything is well with you.  Take care,  Sean 
 The one in Portland, like NE 102nd.

 Fran,  Due to the fact Houston killed several transactions (as opposed to zeroing them out in Scheduling), the real-time position manager is out of balance for December 2 and December 3 at the Mid-C and COB.  December 1 looks OK.  This seems like an issue that Houston is going to have to resolve since they know the deals that were killed.  I will put the necessary interdesk swaps in on Saturday, but I'm going to leave Sunday and Monday open at this point.  If you have any questions, let me or Diana know.  Thanks 
 Miller!  For the love of JESUS!  How are you.  What's up with the layoffs?  Absolutely amazing.  I have seen it all now. 
  So what do you think?  Pretty wild, huh? 
 thanks 
 yes. it came to the office.  i sent it to the yesterday. 
 Do I go and drop him off, or go? 
 I closed out our Balance of February NW position.  The total we pay is $2,111,160.  I'll have more detail to you and Thome in a minute. 
 Fran,  We had a problem with the PGE loss return on that day; I thought we fixed it.  Anyway, I put in a crossdesk (deal 875570).  Thanks. 
 Audrey,  Here is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for Enron for the last 4 years.  I run Enron's short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.  I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:  1.  150 K Base Salary 2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus 3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.  Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks,  Sean Crandall 
 There are a few others:  Pacificorp, Puget, BPA 
 Thanks Fran.  Let me know if it bogs down or anything.  I'd like to get it done. 
 Hi there,  Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to Enron.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.  Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  Florence is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.  Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.  Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.  It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!  Sean 
 Alan,  There are some problems with your attachment.  When are you sending this? 
 Sounds good. 
 Thanks Steve.  I think we might be interested in pursuing something.  It's kind of hectic right now, so let me give you a call when things settle down a little bit.  Probably next week.  Talk with you later. 
 Wednesday or Thursday around noon would be OK. 
 Deborah,  I think when I "left" Enron I was removed from the mailing list, so I don't get Belden's general emails.  Thanks 
 Hey,  You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.  Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.  Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).  As far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.  It's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.  Sean 
 good job. 
 No 
 Dow Jones is interested as well.  I really think a hourly index would be very useful; price discovery, financial positions, etc.

 Hey Kevin,  Just wondering what the status of the DART product is. 
 In case you don't, hey what's going on?  I haven't talked with you in a long time, so I was wondering what's up with you?  How's DC?  How's PGE?  I'm doing OK.  I went to Europe in June (whole month).  Very nice.  Italy, Switzerland, France, and Netherlands.  Hard to come back.  Then I almost went to Duke, but then came to agreement with Enron.  That was interesting.  Anyway, just wanted to touch base.  Let me know what's going on.  Sean 
 Hey!!  What's up.  Do you have AOL Chat or something? 
 Are you still around? 
 I would like to go Monday through Wednesday.  Thanks. 
 The 24-26 is OK with me. 
 You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe= ad DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would = mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off= peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day. 
 Alan,  You were saying we had some instructional material concerning PJM.  Could you provide me with a copy.  Thanks. 
 Kevin,  My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t= he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like= real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20  I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical = product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r= eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir= m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par= ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h= our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo= uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  = I would be short at $28.  The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti= on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su= ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th= at needed to be prescheduled.  As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu= age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal= review).  "This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive= ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day = of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t= ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten= t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."  Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks. 
 Please keep me up to date.  Thanks. 
 My pick is New England. 
 I pick Washington.  I've mailed you my check today. 
 I haven't yet.  I will give him a buzz tonight. 
 Kevin,  One more thing.  We'd like to get some more spreads going.  Specifically the PV/MC, the NP/SP, and the PV/SP.  I realize the PV/SP might be a problem from a legal standpoint because of contract language, but I would like to get the others going.  Can you give me a call some time today?  Thanks. 
 Kevin,  Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C physical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).  Thanks 
 My name is Sean Crandall; I work with Jeff Richter.  I'll send you a check. I'd like to pick the Bears as the losing team this week. 
 I'm not sure if my first response got through.  The person to talk to about this, this long of a term, is Mike Swerzbin.  If you have question concerning the short-term, let me know.  Thanks. 
 I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.  It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.  Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.  Thanks. 
 I have sent a justification for the PBA ($2K) to Amy (per her request).  She has sent it along to Houston. 
 Fran,  I'm pretty sure I've already been hit for some of these.  If you could provide me a P&L copy from June 1 thru today (either electronic or paper) I'd appreciate it. 
 On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.  The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.  As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.  Sean Crandall   (Amy.  Is this good enough?)

 We are 50 MW short at the Mid-Columbia during the offpeak hours for Monday (HE 01 thru HE 06, HE 23-24).  We are short to Portland General.  When you buy, put 25 MW in the Short-Term Northwest Book, and put the other 25 in the West Hourly BOM book.  Sean
