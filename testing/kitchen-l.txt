 Why is he staying with the estate? 
 Who is doing the Gas Logistics restart plan?  Bob Superty hopefully 
 Chris  I am sort of hoping you know about the deadline for start up plans - I know yours is slightly different but something needs to be done by tomorrow.  Thanks  Louise 
 FYI 
 Did you revise this?  I can't find it - let's assume PAs and ETAs go out on 12th.

 Tammy  Let's get together for 5 mins on Monday  In general:  Commercial and Energy Ops on 6.  5 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops.  Also we need a resort of the commercial teams  Can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again.  Thanks  Louise 
 I would hope that in the negotiations of the master we can remove the confirm provision.  Let's discuss Monday 
 Woops 
 Sorry only just got to read this.  I sort of see EOL group as getting the customers to the point of being able to click and our marketers doing the masters.  Looks like we will not get approval anyway - see you Monday morning.  What did we send - it in or out?? 
 We'll need to adjust then.  What did Donnelly say? 
 Buyer to handle 
 CAn you get me the new list 
 Its the week-end so I am finally doing my emails.  I forgot to thank Leslie for doing these - so thanks Leslie it was appreciated. 
 We didn't manage to touch base.  Let's try again next week

 Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.  Contracts Structure  There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.   PassWord Application (PA)  The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline.  We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.   Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)  The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.   General Terms and Conditions (GTC)  To be sent when the Buyer is known. When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc.  Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

 no issues - please contact 
 EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out. 
 Yes - I think Tycholiz sees less value but definitely worth a look 
 Handouts please  Thanks 
 Diary - I will not attend but remind me 
 approved 
  we need a big party organizing for everyone - please sort.  Thanks 
 The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

 I believe so  Fine 
 I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it. 
 Shall we toss for who rings back?  Its going to be a long conversastion. 
 This is our initial proposal.  Please feel free to contact Bill. 
 Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.  Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.  The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell 5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port 5:45		Credit				Bradford 6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall 6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb 7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb Infrastructure			Jenny Rub   Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991  Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.  Tammie - please check availability.  Thanks for your continued understanding.  Louise

 I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?

 No problem  Thanks 
 Did you do anything to it - I can't see. 
 The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.  Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.  The PA is one page and the ETA several.  These are standard and not long.  Let's discuss tomorrow. 
 We will be joining post another meeting so probably will not have time to get back to our offices.  Please feel free to phone in from whereever you like.

 Can you do on gas and power together. 
 The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin.  Have we covered this function?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 I think its the same again - can you come over for it 
 I had a conversation with Richard Stuckey at Citi and he is still struggling with how to do teh EES carve out.  Can I make the following suggestion. 
 Top 50 counterparties - can you send me the list?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Duran removed him - why was he not originally included? 
 What happened to Don's salary?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.  Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer. 
 I have asked one of our deal team lawyers to send you a copy of the document. Her name is Anne Koehler.  Regards  Louise  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou= t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.  All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.  I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same. 
 Seems Marla is the contact.

 I definitely had a black mat last time.  I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.
