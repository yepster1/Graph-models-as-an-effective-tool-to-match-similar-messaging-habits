 Can you do anything about this or do we we just ignore it............... 
 Its not live at the moment but  netteltons@aol.com 
 There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.  Mark please help resolve. 
 We are doing Ok with 3 banks - we may still be in business.  So we should all still have jobs.

 fast for both 
 S. Montovano - E. Gas S. Calcagno - T. Gas J. Dosovich - W. Gas C. Nicolay - FERC A. Combs - W. Power S. Walton - E. Power S. Novosel J. Steffes  I will personally make sure we have Jim.  Please make sure these people are not severed. 
 Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.  Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders. 
 I meant rogue finance guys!! 
 You need to stay - I am trying to get us sold. 
    The same here now 
 Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.  Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.  I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.  If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.  Take care & I will keep in touch.  Louise 
 Have them delivered to Jim Derrick and explain that they are Fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office. I don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now. Thanks   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 You're the king! 
 I don't understand whta she is offering 
 Need to co-ordinate with Greg Piper and Brad Richter 
 You're still there then.  Is Enron Europe in administration or liquidation? 
 Ben please deal with. 
 Ok - I think all the wrtie ups etc are fine - the only one would be EOL that is an issue.  But not the end of the world. 
 Is that all of our originators or just heads? 
 Great thanks 
 4 days is long enough. I'll wait to hear from Carol but I believe we are ok. It was sold - not sure on closing - you need to email rob milnthorp 
 List of traders   Tom Martin Jim Schweiger John Arnold Mike Maggi Andy Zipper Hunter Shively Geof Storey Scott Neal Dana Davis Fletch Sturm Kevin Presto Mike Roberts (Weather - non-trading but lots of apps) Mike Grigsby  Is that enough or do you want all of them? 
 I have the master -= worried about your volume managment people?  Its coming 
 Let's not forget this one 
 I am  going to ask Greg W if you can be included in NewCo, but I never really asked if you wanted to be.  Do you want to be? 
 I left you on Portland for now but obviously when we announce the strucutre it will change.  Duran does know though. 
 We do need a list tomorrow morning.  I am still in meetings.  Is is possible to email me questions. 
 Come and see me tomorrow. 
 Seems like a logical request.  Tell me 90 days is not serious?? 
 All is officially crap here - I have worked 10 weeks straight no week-ends, all night and still its horrible.  Hope its better for you over there.  We have buyers - it's just gettting more and more horrible to be in the building - well actually in Houston come to that.

 Please make sure Tom does does have any of hiis access shut off today by error.  He is not on list 3.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 please contact Bob Macauliffe to make sure he doesn't have Tom cut off from an access and IT perspective.  Its important please make sure you do this immediately you get in.  Thanks 
 Piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet.  EOL is not for sale today. 
 He would be a good addition somewhere - thoughts?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 We would really like some UBS signs for the trading floor - can we take the ones you have here? -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld 
 This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.  A great reflection on you guys too.  Louise   Ref: Houston Chronicle website * * * * * Tuesday, Dec. 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. * * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

 In the interests of full communication - here's an email I sent to EOL.  It's only a comment not a direction for Jay or anything - but it was a pretty sad read for me. 
 you are been estalked! 
 Any time tomorrow morning possible? 
 Give me a ring when you are on your way. 
 Thanks for working on this - I appreciate it.  Louise 
 I did 
 Let's get some time tomorrow.  Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.  Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too. 
 Shouldn't we have let this group go?  Why are we retaining them? 
 Pay 
 no holidays ------------------------ not even christmas 
 I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.  Can we discuss?  Thanks 
 I can send you people.  Jay Webb and Jenny Rub can do the rest.
