t huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.  Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey?  I added to your file schoolyard.  Speak to you later.

 Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;  (i) Correct, and (ii) Correctly allocated  Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.  Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.  Thanks  Louise

 So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.  I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress. 
 Please do 
 ATS is not new origination and shows through the MPR.  All the rest were too small.  Louise 
 great news 
 Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.  In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way. 
 We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:  Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada. Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.  Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.  I am assuming its zero at the moment.   Thanks  Louise 
  Woops  Another coming in 5 minutes. 
 Thanks

 Seems we missed a circulation - this wasn't the last one circulated on Friday.  I will send you the final one at 12. 
 Duran to run it 
 Not prizes for that title. 
 George,  We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?  Louise 
 Been there, done that.  This doesn't allow us to you have to be based in London!!! 
 I do need to alter one slide and also I am keen to see the financial slide whenever it is done.  Hope you had a good week-end.

 Hello - hope you had a good week-end.  Two things - PIPs are still not done and I still have never had my pay reconciled.  Thanks  Louise 
 Hello Pat,  We would like you to price:  Chairs (2) The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.  SOFA The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).

Thanks  Louise Nettelton 
 When is that lunch with the Board we got invited to?  What time are John & I presenting at the Board?  Why do I have meetings on Wed - I thought Chicago was Wednesday? 
 I am hope I haven't just refused this for no reason but if my diary is right - Marcus is away. 
 I can't do these dates.  I will be on my way back from Chicago (Peoples meeting).  Sorry  Louise 
 Not entirely sure - John requested this on Friday I 'll check 
 WAHEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 When is it - I can't miss that if its the budget meeting?  It appears to be every day.  I am a bit worried now about next week - I appear to have some real scheduling difficulties. 
 When is it as Marcus is away on Thursday - I presume Chicago is Wed and obviously I can't do Philadephia as Marcus is away.  I presume you know all this - am I looking at the wrong week - is Chicago next week? 
 Could you put together  a list of all the Enron Corp employees who have Enron (non-Dell) equipment at home. 
 You have two problems  (i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm) (ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap. (approximately ($9mm) is not offset)  Louise

 Duran has to okay it 
 At least she will not keep quiet. 
 Amita is now free 
 I think I have your replacement for Savita.

 Hope you saw the funny side and it cheered you up! 
 Yes 
 One pc - 3 screens  Thanks 
 Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names. 
  Thanks - appreciated 
 We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.  We will not agree to an allocation though.  Thanks  Louise 
  See photo http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=list.jhtml&list_frag=list_5columns_powerwomen.jhtml&list=22&_requestid=8742 
 We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow.  If you want more details - let us know. 
 ok 
 Itss crap - almost all of our own websites.  I've read it - probably have a copy somewhere if you want it. 
 "What happened to this guy? 
 Thanks

 Where are we with www.enrononline.com? 
 No fine thanks 
 I really want it in Q4 - not Q3 
 Yes and Yes 
 Broadcast voicemail - sounded good! 
 Cheers Big Ears 
 Surreal experience really.  I was hoping no-one noticed.  PR did it and as you can imagine - without asking. 
 I rang Jeff - he's out 
 Funny though isn't it! 
 Ha bloody ha 
 No absolutely not 
 Can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately  (at their cost as it is late) whatever they can of the order. 
 Hideous isn't it - I'm 9 months pregnant in it. 
 I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.  (IT budget for this year is $735mm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I'm still working on this one obviously) 
 Trying to keep it quiet too - sems to be working - Lavo didn't even see it 
 Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.  But definitely put a list together.  Thanks 
 I can't tomorrow - how about next time she is in town.  Or in New York? 
 Give her 13 
 I'm ok 
 Both interruptible and firm.  Thanks

 0Knew as usual nothing about this until it was too late. Enron nominated 5 people.  I'm trying to keep it quiet.

 Geoff  This cannot be right - its millions I thought we were about $5mm all in including the secret Zhei project 
 I'm still here too 
  Great thanks 
 Just a quick question  - 23 years for PGT? 
 I concur with your view .  No to all of them  Louise 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?  It'll happen 
 nearly time to go 
 Let's try and keep this quiet. 
 We passed each other .  This answers all my questions  Thanks 
 Just to check have you ever done anything other than gas and zinc.  If so, when and how much? 
  Don't worry orig is what I wanted 
 Thanks very much - perfect. 
 Funny. 
 I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.  Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.  Issues:  Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident? I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.  Thanks  Louise 
 Need to include Saguoro 
 Not for Canada -- for the US 
 thanks - I await the next update 
 P&L 
 Haha - definitely not! 
 Hideous photo - couldn't we have given them a better one! 
 Let's hope no-one else notices.  Let's make sure no-one does anything internally so people notice it.  Thanks 
 Obviously it is not what we want - we are assuming Anthony has power Beth has gas. 
 Why is the CA dated August 6th - have we been sitting on it since then? 
  Is it written yet? 
 Forgot Saguoro (sold it last week) 
 but here is where we got to. 
 and mtm 
 Can you please email me a list of the development sites we have sold this year, what our basis was and what p7l we expect of have from each site.  Please include Onondaga and Doyle, AES site etc.  I need it asap.  Thanks  Louise

 It worked 
 Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.  John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward. 
 Thanks very much.  Louise 
 You won - it was a convincing argument 
 Could you fill in all the other assets  Thanks 
 What about the actual small video tape in the video camera? 
 Mr Haedicke instructed destruction of the videos.  As we couldn't tell which was which - they all went.  I would assume Calgary has a copy.
