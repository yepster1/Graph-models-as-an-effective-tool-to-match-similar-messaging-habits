u lower my bid to $26 for A. Denson? 
 We need a couple of extra players tonight.  Luis - do you have a friend that can play?  Brian - can you ask Lenny to play? 
 Are you up for a little Golden Tee on Friday? 
 who, the aggies, longhorns, or heat? 
 Let me know whether or not you will come. 
 plove has a pool 
 $52 bid for D. Autry 
 the most pitiful excuse for a football game that I have ever seen.  Greg Davis needs to be fired and the young players need to play, i.e. Roy Williams and BJ need to play more than just on third downs. 
 What are we going to do for your 80th?  I have Friday off  - so maybe we can get together for dinner on Thurs?   -E

 What, you tear down the goal posts because you beat the #11 team in the country? 
 We can postpone until the ticker sytem is available.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Eric 
 That sounds good. I don't care - just tell me what kind of food and price range you are looking for. You need to go to ticketmaster and but tickets for the show. Let me know if you need me to get the tkts for you.  -Eric

 that's fine, 3212. 
 yeah, it would probably be better to do it later in the day. preferably after 11:00 
 is a penny good enough?  just kidding, i'll give $25 
 Hey Allison,  Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?  How are things in your world? You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you again?  Eric 
 i got your tickets 
 solid blue is the outermost track - dashe blue is the internal projection for its path so, i have nothing to worry about, woman 
 Just a reminder.  Please try to be at the field by 6:30. 
 $0 for centers 
 What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.  -E 
 congrats on the new position - I just heard    Enron North America Corp. 
 do you want to go beat the crap out of some OU fans in Dallas this weekend? 
 Are you coming to the game tonight? 
 in 
 3 of us are going up Friday and we are staying with a friend of one of the guys in the group. 
 I need to place a $0 bid for Steve Christie and a $0 bid for Wade Richey.  Thanks 
 we were thinking lupe tortillas @ 6:30 
 Jason seemed excited about the concert.  I think  this is one of his favorite bands.  I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest sibling. I am actually going to Dallas on Friday for the TX-OU game.  I am taking a couple of friends from work, so it should be a good time ( it always is).  -E 
 home 713-526-8304 cell 713-628-3104  You are going to leave the big E?  Why?  Where are you going to work? 
 Hi Mom - I got your e-mail yesterday.  Shanna wasn't offended by your poignant political comments, she just knows, in no uncerain terms, that your are Republican and are going to vote for Bush.  Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.  I will pay the late fee the next time I rent a movie.  How are things otherwise?  -E 
 yes, it will be there all season 
 I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate this), Applewhite should play.  I think if Applewhite plays and we have a decent running game, we can blow them out.  Our defense is good enough to shut pretty much anyone down.  When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there? 
 yep 
 our football game is at 7 - sorry 
 Our game is at 7:00 this week.  We play the other Enron team.  Please let me know whether or not you will attend. 
 can't do it - for one I don't have curtis martin and for two fred taylor has no value right now - propose something for someone I have 
 we will get there early and get a table.  it is on 59 feeder in between kirby and shepherd (north side of 59) 
 I forgot, I offered you Toomer and Garner for Terrell and Jackson - if you still want to do that then that is fine - if not look at the deal below. 
 My deal on the other side fell through - so what do you think about Garner, Toomer, and Schroeder for Terrell and Rice 
 Is this some scam foundation that you have set up so that you can retire early... I know how these things work, I've been around the block.  Seriously though, I will be happy to contribute.  -Eric 
 If only we had your camaro to cruise in . . . 
 are you serious? i just talked to you 5 minutes ago   Hector Campos                09/28/2000 01:09 PM 
 Since most were out of town last weekend, we were thinking of celebrating Brian's birthday again tonight at The Cheesecak Factory at 7:00.  Let me know if you will be able to attend.  -Eric 
 After the weekly bidding process is finished, you can complete all transactions on the website. 
 Are we done? 
 I found something that New Orleans has to offer that Houston doesn't . . .  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/09/26/school.shooting.03/index.html 
 and i will throw in beasley 
 you never responded to my last offer - Taylor and Anderson or Watters for Garner and Freeman? 
 Horn for M. Anderson  You are short WRs 
 no, sorry 
 $0 bid for darrell jackson 
 yeah, try to be there on time - preferably 6:30 - b/c we only have eight people 
 Our game tonight is at 7:00.  Please try to make it by 6:30.  As of now we have eight people.  Tim - can you see if Micah can play again? 
 no. i didn't know that.  i guess it will be like def comedy jam 
 yep 
 Thought you might be interested in this link for a beach vacation.  http://affiliate.travelnow.com/specials/000926manzanillo.html 
 Are you going to make tomorrow? 
 our game is at 7:00 tomorrow - can you make it? 
 your choice of anderson or watters   and  taylor 
 touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good all year. My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.  Let me know 
 alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring back in the league) will still be there. 
 George has no value after last weeks games - I will give you garner and toomer for taylor 
 Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez? 
 Matt has a win and Harry a loss.  They tied but the win goes to the one with the most reserve points. 
 yeah, just come by my desk.  i have it for you. 
 Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.  Do you want to go?  -Eric 
 Alright, you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him? 
 here, woman! 
 Let me know whether or not you can make it to the game on Wednesday @7. 
 Anyone up for half price pizza tonight, say around 7:45?  And yes, I am a fat ass!  Let me know. 
 I need your dues by COB today! 
 Your WRs are terrible - let me help you out

 Rob,  The product descriptions look good.  Go ahead and move forward with the rest of the process.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 See Below: 
 Here is the Room info for next week. 
 I just now saw it.  It looks like a great gift (more from a daughter than a son).  I will look at it when it comes.    Enron North America Corp. 
 You can only pick up players for the upcoming sunday's game through the bidding process.  No pick ups will be allowed after wednesday on any given week. 
 I don't know, babe.  What did you get?    Enron North America Corp. 
 yeah i mentioned that you are looking to rotate.  i would give him a call 
 If you want to pick up a player - you need to let me know by today - b/c I will be on vacation tomorrow. 
 Did we ever decide on the whether to change to the owner's club or not? 
 that bid won't be there next week :( 
 have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!  Let me know 
 walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.  now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters, anderson or george?  I need to know fairly quickly 
 alright then anderson rather than watters 
 what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters? 
 Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack? 
 713-853-0977 
 yeah i will be there  who all is going to sierra and what time? 
 see the bottom for directions 
 just to let you know - s. davis is worth much more than taylor and m. robinson is worth much more than george (even if george is starting).  garner and toomer for taylor 
 that's great! what do you want for taylor? 
 what do you want for taylor? 
 $2 bid for Marcus Pollard 
 please take me out of my bid for kennison 
  Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback Sept. 19, 2000 By Len Pasquarelli SportsLine.com Senior Writer     Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed.  "If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."   Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP)  In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games.  A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change.  One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis.  The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 yards per catch this season.  But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter.  "There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else." 
 i think i can scrounge one up    Enron North America Corp. 
 By the way, wear your grey "HEAT" jerseys to the game and bring a blue t-shirt as an extra. 
 we have at least 8 
 can you make reservations for 7:00 at beef and bird?  thanks, e 
 I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop. Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of pride. 
 We have a game tonight at 7:00.  Please try to make it to the field by 6:30.   -Eric 
 $1 bid for Bjornson $0 bid for greg clark 
 A clarification - you can only bid whole dollars for players, i.e no $1.50 bids - O'neal. 
 I bid $5 for Eddie Kennison. 
 that is fine 
 40/20 
 i was looking at brio vista and jeffreys - i was thinking jeffreys but let me know I was thinking we would have an "organized dinner" on Friday and catch something on the way back from the game on Saturday (since it is late). Let me know  -e 
 that is fine, as long as you know how to find it.  did you make reservations for dinner yet? 
 Come on man- you need help?  I am willing to talk receiver and RB swaps 
 Hey Gillette,  The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to supply you with some of the guidelines.  -Bass 
 it is typical to counter offer when you don't like my offer 
 freeman and garner and mcnabb for taylor and george 
 What do you want for Taylor? 
 now, now - you didn't look that great against UTEP.  we will see what happens once we settle on a qb

 Hey Aunt Bonnie,  I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.  Love,  Eric 
 Do you know if you are going to make it yet? 
 Thanks Harry.  I appreciate the recognition.  Eric 
 go to transactions - set lineup    Enron North America Corp. 
 make sure to deduct $20 from the check b/c you got second place in the pts pool this week. 
 just bring me a check (i'm on 32) 
 why don't you just make the payment to them this month and we will set up the arrangement next month when you have your new job 
 Please e-mail me who you want to add and drop.  Check you roster to make sure that it is legal.   I still need your dues by Sunday or you forfeit.  I have only received dues from Dave and Steve! 
 Brett,  Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare time on your hands. Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times (lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking. Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  Where are you currently stationed?  Drop me a line next time you come to houston?  -out 
 So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better way).  Let me know  -E 
 I want to place a $1 bid for darrel jackson - (WR SEA)

 Tony Richardson and Wayne Chrebet for Antonio Freeman? 
 My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.

So, if you want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.  Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.  Let me know 
 I just though you would be interested in knowing that the UT game that you are going to will be at 6 pm.  http://www.texassports.com/fbo/fbc/2000schedule.html

 I know this is the same as before, but are interested after this week's action?  Ricky and Warrick for Carter and Smith? 
 sorry if we do around 80 
 i got a second room but don't know if we will keep it if we dont - around 54 if we do around 60 
 you better shape or other players are going to jump ship to the mullets.  i am noticing a recurring theme here in our fantasy leagues - first the gangsta and now marcus. 
 Marcus Robinson was just telling me how much he likes his new digs compared to TKC.  He loves Tijuana.  What kind of show are you running over there?  - THE MULLETS 
 you have to like garcia against carolina over brunell against balt or bledsoe against njy ...  don't you? 
 How about Garcia and Bettis for Brunell? 
 So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made to me on October 18th, 2001). Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any exceptions for you.  Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.  -Eric
