 Melissa,  As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly "accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.  January-  Total Accrual Value = $266,504  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid = $105,000 Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000) Total Value =                                   $148,750  February-  Total Accrual Value = $289,305  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid = $100,000 Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000) Total Value =                                   $177,000  March -  Total Accrual Value = $292,145  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid = $106,000 Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000) Total Value =                                   $172,000  Let me know if you have any questions.

 What I am really looking for is a way to save monthly production data by county for the entire state for all of the data.  Unfortunately, saving the data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time.  Thanks for your help.  Eric Bass

 No.  I went last year and it was more packed than on a regular day. 
 Hey Dad,  Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery.  What is the skinny?  Is this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed?  How are things otherwise?  Love,  -e 
 We have a game tonight at 6:45.  Please try to be there by 6:30.  Let me know whether or not you will be at the game.  Eric 
 I don't think 5:15 is a great time for us, but don't let us keep you from going to the show.  If you want to go to the early show, we won't be offended.  We can do something another time.  We would love to do something with you if you decide against the 5:15 show. 
 Melissa,  Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo. I will follow up with these specific details.   Eric 
 Melissa,  Here are the accrual values for Q1.  More details to follow.  Jan - $266,504 Feb- $289,305 Mar - $292,145  Eric    Enron North America Corp. 
 That sounds good.  We will be there! 
 There is not enough data on it to make an educated decision.  It looks like they have the backing of an I-bank to place some more stock so that is somewhat encouraging.  You are going to have to make your own call on this one.  If you like the idea and you think they can execute, then go for it.

 Jill,  I was wondering if I could get some information on the Costilla deal, specifically the repurchase option.  I need to know the term, locations, volume and strike price of the call.   Thanks,   Eric x3-0977 
 i will go 
 What do I look like - a key map?  Take Allen Parkway to Shepherd.  Make a right on Shepherd and a quick left on Memorial.  Follow Memorial all the way to the park.  I don't know which side you will play on b/c both sides have fields. 
 Hey,  I tried to call you.  I need Brandi's Work #, Home # and Social Security #.  E 
 Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value. 60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.  For example:  Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.  This means that:  Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000  Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)  Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been previously recognized. Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.   Call with questions.  Eric x3-0977 
 Did you make your reservation? 
 The new product will be a day product like our current Katy and HSC Pool products, so it will be a fixed price product for next day gas delivered at the Corpus location.   Call with questions.  x3-0977   Dale Neuner   04/03/2000 04:35 PM 
 what's up with the migraines? that is two weekends in a row!  the concert was good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear black ballon and name - so i was happy.   i felt sick this weekend too - so mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.  I did get to go to a game at my new field (Enron).  It is a great place to see a ballgame.  You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and the Astrodome.  I left early on Friday b/c I am a shooter :)  The Fam is great and Jason has not found a new job yet.  Phew! I think I got all of them (the questions, that is).  -e 
 I don't know.  I haven't heard anything.  You might want to talk to superfan ( aka  Chad) 
 Dale,  The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.  We already have a baseload Index Corpus product.  We need to create a DAY Corpus product with the same parameters as this baseload product.   Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?  Thanks,  Eric 
 I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs. I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).  Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let me know.  Let me know what you think.  Hook 'Em! -Eric 
 Tonight's game has been cancelled 
 Hey  I just got your msg from friday.  I left at around three.  How was your weekend?  Did you make it to earth day?  Talk to you later. 
 I don't know the YMCA's policy on rain outs so  I will assume that we still have a game tonight.  Our game is at 7:45 tonight.  Please let me know if you will be there.   Eric 
 Thought you might find this interesting! 
 I will play if the street thug doesn't 
 It doen't matter to me. 
 I would like to sign up for the lottery for all four days.   Thanks,  Eric    Enron North America Corp.

 sorry 
 FYI 
 Dale,  Ed Gottlob would like to set up a meeting with all of the necessary counterparties in order to discuss this product.  Can you find out when a good time would be?   Thanks,  Eric   Dale Neuner   03/28/2000 10:56 AM 
 Dale,  Have you heard anything more on the 5 X 24s?  We would like to get this product out ASAP.   Thanks,  Eric 
 no, we are fine 
 FYI 
 Our first flag football game is tonight! Are you in? 
 Please try to make it tonight by 7:45 to go over some things. 
 The game is at 8:45 at the Post Oak YMCA.  The Post Oak YMCA is outside the loop at the corner of San Felipe and Augusta.  We have eight as of now, so make sure and let me know if you can't make it for any reason. 
 We have seven as of now.  If you want to play, you will play the whole game.  Let me know. 
 here is a template for some plays - it might be helpful to have a list of plays to show during the game 
 Will you be able to make it to the game tonight?  It is at 8:45 at the Post Oak YMCA.  Let me know.   Eric 
 The game is at 8:45 on Monday@ the Post Oak YMCA.  Let me know if you can make it. 
 Our first game of the new season will be Monday night.  I do not have the time yet, but will let you know.  Please let me know if you are still interested in playing and whether you will be available Monday or not.   Thanks,  Eric 
 last again... 
 Hey Lisa,  Long time no hear!  I guess you are too cool for all of us little people now.  Brenda is looking for someone to fill Bryan Hull's spot in risk when he leaves.  I know that you are looking for a rotation, so I was wondering if you have an interest.  Let me know.   Eric 
 Yea.  I will be there.  What time again? 
 i'm getting really freaking tired of being last on your e-mail lists! 
 What the fuck is up with that? 
 aren't we presumptious.  of course i want to see you tonight.  but i have to work out before coming over!  what are you making me for dinner?  and do you want me to bring over a movie?  and, by the way, you have my permission to go to your little crawfish boil on sat. e 
 Have you heard anything on the sitara issues?  Thanks,   Eric 
 Dan,  Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?   Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 i don't know any of those people either    Enron Capital Management 
 Luis,  I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in early April.  So, I will try to schedule a practice.  Let me know when you are back.  Eric 
 i will go if you want me to - does that sound familiar? 
 do you want me to go? 
 Dolores,  I have signed up for the CFA exam in June.  Who do I need to talk to to get a reimbursement?   Thanks,  Eric 
 what sounds good. next week or thurs? 
 I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.  I don't think you can make a case that you were smart for betting me without the points.  That's like me saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am confident that it is going to 90.  That's real smart.  No wonder EES loses money!    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sorry about the headache.  I hear that slamming your head against the wall is good for getting rid of migraines.  Oh wait that's what I do at work to help me think about something other than losing lots of money - never mind.  Thurs is probably best then - if not then maybe next week. e 
 i  have his marathon pictures up as wallpaper on my computer.  he is so sexy with his shirt off.  did you have a good weekend?  do you still want to get togehter after work sometime this week?  lemme know 
 how was the well this weekend?    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI.  There might be some back office issues with this. 
 what is ramiro's last name? 
 Everything is working.  Thanks for the help.   Eric 
 Market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in the wellhead portfolio.  I do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead portfolio.  However, I do not see a problem with the market deals unless they were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders).  -EB    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is my bracket.  I will bring the money down around 10:30. 
 When is graduation?  And, of course I will show up.  Although, if I recall, you didn't show up for mine! You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006. I haven't heard of the advertising firm.  What kind of projects do they work on?   I am going to Earth Day. Are you?  Are you bringing Rebecca again this year? We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. Patty's day.  What about you?  e 
 Things are going well here.  I have been pretty busy losing lots of money at work. Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the month, but I can't go because of work.  It doesn't bother me that much though.   I will probably try to take a trip over there in May.  On top of that I am thinking about a cruise this summer some time. Brian and I are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the Park at Midtown.  Brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony, so we are going to move to an interior apartment.  Of course, I wouldn't expect you to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment.  Oh well, I guess you have your priorities.  Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  How are things with you and the fam?  e 
 Phil,  Can you provide me with the most recent Entex Deferral Balance?   Thanks 
 I don't know about meter 4486, but the other three are good.  In addition, meter 5792 is another meter that is serviced in the Lufkin-Diboll area.    Enron North America Corp.

 Tim is once again proving how hard work is over there at EES.  Keep holding the stock price back. I am, however, impressed that you were still at work at 3:50 though.  By the way, I am taking bets from all comers.  So, put your money where your mouth is!  Hook 'em      Enron North America Corp.

 It only takes about 10 minutes to get to highland village from here.  I can go anytime between 11-1ish. Not too much exciting going on here.

 I hope you were only thinking good things! I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended family in Fairfield. Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?  They have the cutest kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time with them.  I had fun at your birthday party!  When do I get to take you to PF's for lunch?

 i had a really fun weekend.  we went to chuy's and gallant knight on friday, a work party and black swan on saturday, and had the super bowl party on sunday.  about 20-25 people showed up to the party, so it was a fairly big success. of course, you didn't show up so it wasn't as successful as it could have been.  how was yours?

 You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.  I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of November.  -Eric

 We have actually already called Springer to get on his "Surprise, I'm dating your brother" episode.  It's a pretty good deal b/c you get an all expense paid trip to Chicago for the weekend.  I am actually a multimillionare now - I'm thinking about buying that new car.  Do you want one? There is not much going on this weekend on my end - I will probably take it easy.  And you?  Let me guess - you are going to try and stop by my place (that will happen)? 
 He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.  If not, he is applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.  I think he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am waiting to hear about that.  By the way, have you seen Enron's stock the last two days.  It has gone from 53 to 72.  It 's good to work for the big E!  the big E

 Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical.      Enron North America Corp. 
 Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.  Eric    Enron North America Corp.

 A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much does the quality of the high end amp matter?  Thanks 
 Thanks for your help.  There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have further questions.   Thanks,  Eric x3-0977

 SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip." So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:  1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12. 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10. 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. 7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook. 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. 10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T." 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not say, Eat me" 12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry," 13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. 14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.   The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money. Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.
