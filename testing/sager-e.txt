yment" to show that payments could go to Seller from Buyer and in (c) to add words "as amended". 4) Added Exhibit III/Option Premium.  Schedule to ISDA  Changes Made:  1. Added ENA as specified entity ML (Part 1 a). 2. Fixed names in Part 1 (k) from ML and Enron to Credit Support Provider. 3. Add notice for ML (Part 4/a). 4. Reference amendment to Guaranty (Part 4 (f)). 
 Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the Power Master (already in existence ("Old CSA")).  1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA ("New CSA"). Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in place between ENA and ML.  2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA. Revised Schedule attached.  3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document named "Power Amendment 1).      (black-line version) 
 As we discussed, enclosed are execution copies of the documents that we have been working on.  Please review, and if acceptable, have an authorized officer of ML execute each of the enclosed documents and return to my attention at fax no. 713 646 3490.  We will follow up with hard copies.  Thanks for all your help.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Andy  David Portz and I will be available to attend the meeting in DC.  Look forward to seeing you then. Happy New Year Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 great 
 Hi  Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against other Gains and Losses.  Happy New Year e 
 On?  Name the time (400?) and the spot (Met?)  e 
 At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA.  The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.  If you have any questions, please call me at 36349. 
 Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it (lunch will be served) 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or is contemplating taking relating to TVA:  Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA)  Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker  Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of notice)  Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface issues  If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me immediately.  Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,  Elizabeth Sager 36349

 Thanks Bob. I would love a copy of the memo.   Elizabeth 
 As a follow-up to the earlier email, we plan to file the Calpine petition THIS FRIDAY (the 21st).  Please call me at 36349 and let me know if you have any thoughts/comments ...on the petition.  Thanks  Elizabeth 
 Greg  Original email that was sent to me, also was suppose to be sent to  you, but it went to the wrong Greg Woulfe.  So here it is.  Also, date of filing is wrong.  We want to file this Friday, the 21st.  Let me know if you have any thoughts/changes.  Thanks  Elizabeth  36349 
 FYI - This Friday  (21) not Next 
 Surpassing last year's record will be easy.  Great to see you as well and Feb 2 looks great.  Lets talk on the first.  713 853 6349 
 What time 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT  Here is the draft TVA petition covering all 3 issues we have with TVA that we are planning to  file tomorrow, the 27th.  Please call me no later than than 9:00 with any comments.  Thanks  Sorry for the short notice 
 Thanks for the comments Elizabeth 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional claim, EPMI needs the courts approval.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.  Copies of the letter will be distributed later .  Elizabeth Sager 36349

 Hi Andy  I read through all of your Article this weekend .  What a job!  I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Janel  I'm not sure.  I thought the meeting was being set up to coordinate efforts between regulatory, legal and ENA and EES.  The meeting was requested by Christi Nicollay. 
 see this attachment: 
 lets discuss at 130 
 As promised, here is rough idea of deal.  Terms have changed since this was prepared.   I will keep you informed as the deal progresses. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 nothing I know of 
 fyi 
 Tuesday works great for me.  As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet finished, revisions to Product B.  I have several questions and will need input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.  I spoke w Harlan briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the "one-time, good faith effort" to find an ADI.  I will call Harlan and Marjie to further discuss.  A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Today its my turn to be the goof - today I can't make it.  Sorry.  How about tomorrow Sager 
 pretty skimpy but here it is. 
 Sheila  FYI.  I will forward to you the written reviews I have done.   Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 I did say Thursday right?  Thursday noon? 
 brenda please set up in mydirectory as the next TVA letter 
 Please call me with comments concerning the following two letters: 
 Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show changes from Fred's last draft.  The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the proposal being held  "open" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).  Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of "Green Requirement".  Fred - I wanted to stick to "would" instead of "will"  as the operative verb in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal.  If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.  Elizabeth 36349 
 Fred I don't think we have to wait, but if time permits we might as well fix. Elizabeth 
 Christi  Could you please email the TVA draft letter. Thanks If I don't talk to you before you leave, have a great trip. 
 Hi  Will you call you later to discuss 
 positively - how about early monday? take care Elizabeth 
 At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests. This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this afternoon if possible  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Andy  As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.  The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:  1.  Changed  the Section entitled "Performance Assurance" to "Collateral Threshold" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral.  2. Added the words "acceptable to Party ___" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party.  3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are "Applicable" or "Not Applicable".  As always thanks for your help. Elizabeth 713.853.6349 
 Thanks 
 brenda this would not print for me. would you try 
 fyi lets discuss later 
 Hi Leslie  I would love to but I'm not sure right now about my schedule. I'm moving offices and everything is a mess.   I will call you if it looks like I can get away.  If not I'll call (or please call me)  in a couple of weeks (I'm out all next week).  See you soon  Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
 please call me w any final comments 36349 
 A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains "substantive" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the "deemed accepted" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language. The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote. 
 Let me know if there is anything else I can do Thanks Sager 
 Enron votes no. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
 In what I'm sure is an oversight, EEI forgtot to send me a ballot. After appealing for my right to vote, a ballot was forthcoming.  I voted "NO" on the proposal.  We will see what happens from here. 
 tva letter w presto change (generator to generation) and fixed typo (Customerss to customers')

 So sad.  No questions at all on EEI?  I'm dying having to write a 2 hour presentation on this despicable contract and I know not what to do it hurts me so bad.  Oh my.  Nice day for a run, even a slow one.

 What's the deal, Michigan vs. Duke? Cox and SagerII? If Arizona does anything in the final, SagerI has it nailed.  Arizona any good? see ya at 415 
 I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard floors) .  Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.  Sad I am. 
 Dear Gail wants a party at a house.  If you remember we volunterred if kids came. Gail said kids or no kids, whatever we wanted. what do you think? Kids (ours plus katie and oscar and eleanor) at our house on Sat.  Punt to Ted w/no kids? 
 Don't go without me ... I can't go this week  ... or next week, other than Wed. (does that work?).  The week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, .... look fine too. 
 Tuesday, GAD's only birthday request was for an "old-timey" chocolate cake" (the kind that's not very good but she likes anyway). Today, on reflection, she asked for oysters.  Grant's special ones. All my hard work and you get the fame. 
 another request - delegate as you feel appropriate thanks 
 I hope so. GIve me a call sometime. I could have lunch today, the 28th.  Can you? 
 I,m jealous of your beautiful dog, but do you have any pictures of family? Lunch tommorrow is out (standing in line at post office to get passport for trip to Paris).  Next week I'm mostly out (trip to NY with daughter Ella for wedding of girlfriend I've known since I was Ella's age) but call me anyway or I'll try to call you. PS As you can tell, work is a low priority right now, so .... let's go! 
 oops, a little slow 
 FYI in case you hadn't already heard 
 Hi  Gave Jackie's resume to Mark Taylor.  Did he call her yesterday?  I'm out this weekend w little "Eloise" (only the finest); let the 60's live! 
 Hi Dede  I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project.  On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) at lunch?  Let me know.  Hope you have fun on Friday night.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.  This agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.  Call me at 713 853 6349 if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
 John  I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.  Talk to you soon Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi John  Thanks for the email re TVA.  As usual, things got behind me last week so I wasn't able to move the TVA letter forward.  I have  promised Kevin something by today - so I may be calling you this afternoon.  Hope all is well  Elizabeth 
 Hi Dede  Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a roller-coaster of an airplane for over 5 hours fighting a "terrific headwind" according to the pilot.  See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.  Elizabeth 
 As promised. Call me when you want to disucss. FYI - The letter is very "lawyerly"; I'm not sure this is the right approach though.  Let me know if you think this tone will do more harm than good.  Paragraphs for you to consider are in brackets. 
 Kevin  Richard Tabors number is 617 543 5304.  John Basinger and Barrett Reasoner with the Gibbs and Brun law firm would like to get a hold day with him ASAP.  Thanks for your help  Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi  Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a mess.  I think I better work on that shot.  Tennis on Wed.?  Elizabeth 
 There is no guarantor for NHEC.  I have not received the form of LC.  Issuing bank is National Rural Utility Coop Finance Corp. Thanks Elizabeth 
 Sounds great.  See you on Wed. at 1230 unless I hear from you. 
 thanks 
 good for us 
 Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten untold grief for using HOUSTON).  See ya at 1230 
 Yippee 
 thanks 
 I would love them if still available 
 Robbi  Sometime on Wed, Thurs. next week would be fine to get together (I'm out early next week doing the last of the roadshows on the Edison contract - I can't wait for the process to be over - it has been going on for over a year).  Call my assiatant Brenda Whitehead at 35438 to schedule a time.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349
