erent from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master.  2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing). This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool fails.  Just FYI, the god awful "Into"product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable. 
 Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a basketball game and dinner in the offing.  Talk to you soon. 
 done 
 I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just let me know and we can find another time. 
 Rodgers As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 see you there at 4:00 unless I call you 
 yuk.  so sorry to have to cancel that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 430 call to wrap it up don't they know we have better things to do here is to getting back on track after thanksgiving sorry again 
 per my vm

 Mark  Here is a revised draft of the CDWR risk memo.  Events change everyday. This morning's paper reports that a rate increase of 40% may be imposed by the CDWR as early as today and the new bond issue amount is purported to be 16 billion (rather than the 10 initially discussed) 
 Mark As we discussed, here is a copy of the draft memo. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 see you there on court 10  ps I may have to come back to work for a 615 call 
 Here is latest draft of risk memo (STILL IN DRAFT FORM).   I faxed comments to you on dash.  Do you have any current info on deal status?  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 no problem 
 Hi Mike  I am definitely coming out for meeting on Monday - if you want to hit/play before meeting let me know and I'll bring my stuff.  See you there. 
 MY MEMO 
 sounds great .  see ya there. 
 Hi Carol  I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).  Good luck on your search.  ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after Thanksgiving. 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
 log sheet and written verification letter to come later - give copy of script to Mike or whoever else will be securing quotes 
 I would think so but not sure - it sounds like DP is in US 
 Thanks for the documents.  If OK w you, I will look at during my flight on Sunday and will call you on Monday am  if I have any comments.  If this isn't OK, please leave me a voice mail and I will try to review earlier.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349  PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it an""EEI Canada"?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in the name of the organization that "approves" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to get EEI's approval/consent. 
 Jeff  I enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to Houston.  As promised, here is the information about the Ontario meeting regarding the creation of a Physical Power Master for Canada.  Don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts or comments.  Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
 Attached is draft escrow language for Black Hills that I made up in an attempt to be sympathetic to Black Hills's desire for certainty on the release of funds - please review and call Shari with comments first thing on Wed.  I will be travelling Wed but will check messages on Wed afternoon. Good luck 
 At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input. 
 Hi  We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing invitations now.  Here it is:  Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo? Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer to  ..... shop.  PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday. 
 Thanks for your message  Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator. Coaching seems to be his real passion.  I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are scrambling to find a birthday concept.  On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - let me know when you can.  Talk to you soon. 
 Let's try for thurs at 1130 - call me if you need to change time/date. 
 Sorry for the delay but here it is  - A good landscape architect in the Heights is Pam August (husband name Todd) who lives on Cortdlandt (sorry no number) between 7th and 8th. 
 HI Just got this message - email at home couldn't open attachment.  Go ahead a send rest when you can, no problem.  Hey, will you send me your new address. thanks 
 I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.  PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi. Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think. 
 Mark , I assume that I should continue work on this. If its OK with you, I would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for physical/financial(maybe) trading. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do. 
 Attached is a brief memo I prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled for Wed., May 23rd, to discuss setoff issues.  Please call if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 per our discussion 
 Chi is now confused.  She want to do the wedding but is feeling overwhelmed by all the issues:  Mom Her sickness John Short notice for all involved creating tension She and Douglas feeling stressed as a result of above Mom  She seeks advice from a sage Midwesterner.  What do you think - Delay or hasten onward 
 Sorry I didn't get too far but What I read I think is looking great - good luck 
 Hi John  Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a meeting.  The Black Hills deal is still stuck in credit land so I will call the Denver office if need be.  Thanks again and I look forward to speaking with you soon. 
 Hi Charlotte  I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week.  PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too  See you soon 
 That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to play.    drusso@reliant.com 06/05/2001 01:55 PM

 Hi Phil Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000 with the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are invited with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more leisurely morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them home. If we were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.  Let me know what you would like.  thanks

 Kaye Please forward the attachment Thanks 
 I'll get on it Mon.  Have a great weekend. 
 Genia  Please forward to person who is looking at Midam  Thanks e 
 Please review and forward comments to me early Thursday morning so we can distribute along with a copy of my explanatory memo.  I will forward a redraft of the memo to you for final review prior to distributing to John L and Dave D. Thanks 
 Janice  Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll. 
 Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of a draft confirm that we use with TVA. 
 Any way you think Andrew might like power trading?  His resume looks strong. 
 Thanks for resending message.  I look forward to playing later in December 
 Yeah  - go ahead and see if he wants a challenging position in a rewarding place. Thanks 
 absolutely.  see you on sat around 530.  ps - wildfires not just there - I've heard as well over here. Congratulations 
 I'm not sure about Sat - Grant has been trying to get a sitter - he called Lynne and Cecilia.  Are you going? 
 Hi  Thanks for the good news - It pleases me to know end to be creating EEI babies throughout the world - bandwidth is also using it. Hooray Brenda should have sent a presentation I did that summarizes EEI - Hope its helpful;avoid the DISASTER - it only applies in the US. Also, Andy's article may be helpful.  Have a great weekend.

 Mark  Attached is a draft of the chart of power risks.  Let me know if there is anything else you would like me to do on this.  We are still in the process of reviewing top exposures with credit.   Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi Charlotte  Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the same onslaught.  When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.  See ya 36349 
 sounds great  but let me check w Grant and I will call you tomorrow 
 Dinner on Sat would be great. Lovely xmas card. 
 So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would likely give her some barbiesque items  for the reasons you stated (she's going to get them from somebody someday). 
 FYI  - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on finalizing Shari's move to Portland.  Shari is looking for a "relocation" package.  HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that works.   HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H and then present to Shari. End of Feb is still the target date.  Hope all well (despite the press).  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi Shari  I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS 
 Thanks for your message - sorry to hear your schedule ( I thought mine was bad).  No problem from my side not playing until 2001 - let's talk that first week and arrange a time.  Hope you have a great holiday in NY. 
 enjoy the snow 
 With pleasure.  822 Columbia Houston Texas  77007 
 Hi  I'm thrilled you are also speaking at ISDA.Thanks  Any chance you can hit on Wed? If not we may have to resume our REGULAR WEEKLY SCHEDULE after the holidays.  Let me know. 
 Thanks for dinner on Sat  - As always, Grant and I really enjoyed getting together with you guys.  Lets pretend its my birthday in January and go again.  See ya 
 Hi  I would love to but don't think I will be able to  - we leave for DC on Friday morning.  How about the following week? 
 EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE "the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate". What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap.  I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are "artificially" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue.  Thanks for your thoughts. 
 Mark  Attached are my comments to your Hypotheticals. Call with any questions   Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Attached is a chart showing how I thought the PGE assignment could work. Let me know what else we can do.  Thanks 
 I think attachment is missing since I didn't get confirm.  Check w genia re paper - I think we have something but is skimpy 
 You are correct on the facts PGET pays a higher price to Morgan than EES pays to PGET - hence the payment to EES 
 thanks  we will likely need to simple corporate help as well to work on assignments/termination - if possible maybe you could get somebody to assist to also be on call.c 
 As promised.  THANKS    713 853 6349

 Hi David  FYI - Janice is out until the 22nd of Jan. so when you are finished with comments, please send them to me as well.  As soon as we have the "live" deal give me a call and we will see who has availability to assist you.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 please call after reading 
 All done? 
 This is another TVA letter.  Can you please put in my directory, add our standard addresses and heading and set up for signature for Kevin Presto VP .  I will work on editing letter after you fix format. thanks 
 Hooray

 Credit contact person is William Bradford at 713 853 3831 or you can call me at 713 853 6349. 
 thanks 
 John  I think the letter looks good. I made a few changes which I am enclosing.  thanks 
 Preliminary draft not yet reviewed by EES - let me know if you have comments  PS - Powerx deal is not one of the assigned transactions.  thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Please deliver to Peter ASAP thanks 
 I think it would be better in a side letter so as not reinvovle Avista at this point and raise any new issues - is that ok 
 Thanks again for all your help 
 Hi I am here.  We are closing tonight.  Call when you can.Thanks 
 Here are the revised documents that we will need EEMC to sign.  Please coordinate signatures w Travis.  Thanks Elizabeth   36349 
 FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages. Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing to all parties.  Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.  Thanks again. 
 the e-mails sent by Rogers Herndon are encrypted and cannot be opened. 
 Hi Angela  Sorry I did not get back in touch w you earlier - my mom passed away over the holidays and I have been out of the office and don't know exactly when I will be back (definitely out the week of 15th).   I look forward to playing and will call you when I get back to play. 
 Bill told us last night the true up payments run to PGET 
 documents prepared by Shari w LLG help, sent to Avista  (i just found that out) 
 Andy  Sorry to get back to you so late - I've been out of town and will be out all this week as well.  A meeting on  14th/15th in DC would be great for me. Just let me know.  If you need to reach me this week - just leave me a voice mail at 713 853 6349.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Any idea where EES is on this this am - I'm meeting w Mark H now to discuss. 
 please print 
 fyi - we have right to terminate EEMC power positions assumed by EPMI and have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if they don't help us on the collateral issues. 
 Sounds like a great idea - I'll talk to Grant and let you know.  Meanwhile can you hit this week?  Let me know. 
 please distribute to whoever you think would be interested. 
 Hi Andy  I would be happy to participate in whatever session/role in either or both Atlanta and/or Newport that you think would be helpful/appropriate - just let me know.  Thanks - Hope all is well. 
 I'd love to - Nothing bigger than setoff now. 
 Thanks for the words of encouragement 
 I approve this request but I am unable to access website.  Please advice what I should do. 
 Absolutely  - lets get Marcus involved.  With all the activity in NEPOOL and Leslie being out, I was thinking that Marcus should be the other NEPOOL expert. 
 FYI I was also helping on this deal as was Jason. Thanks Elizabeth 
 goes with other email.  thanks

 oops - i can't today but another day yes.  i'll call you later. 
 I will 
 Still working on it - I'll let you know final results soon 
 final settlement date is 2/16 i hope not 1/16 - thanks 
 Thanks - hope to see you soon 
 thanks and congrats too 
 thanks for the words of encouragement 
 Hi Paul - I am alive  but barely.  California is dark and so and I. Hope to talk to you soon. 
 have a good weekend 
 sure - could be interesting 
 Brent - I didn't work on the deal but I think it was a deal we did with a Florida company, maybe Florida Power likely in 96.  Melissa Murphy or Kim Theriot may be able to help locate.  Let me know if I can do anythin else. 
 how about thursday lunch? 
 Harlan - Dede is out this week - how about I take everybody out for lunch on Tuesday and we can figure out what to do for speech.  In the meanwhile, I'm going to give ISDA the charts we used at last ISDA meeting for distribution and Dede is going to get copies of various US agreements to ISDA.  Let me know of Tuesday works or if not other open day.  Thanks 713 853 6349 
 please print and put in binder with labels thanks 
 Hi John  Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?  I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works for you. 
 Richard just told me that we settled PCA.  That's great news but I will miss the opportunity to work with you.  Thanks for all your help on this matter and I hope we get to work together again on some other matter in the near future. 
 I don't know much but I think Dan Lyons is well versed on this.  Also maybe Dale R in Portland.  Hope all is well. 
 I'm open all day

 How about meeting for lunch on Tues at Ruggles (on Main) at noon? 
 how about 400 
 I do have a conflict so 400 would be better 
 after would work great for me 
 Hi John  You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time so....).  Now that you are back,  I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be shattered. Meanwhile,  I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.  And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at  900 Houston time to discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?  If not, no big deal.  Talk to you soon. 
 sounds great meet you on Smith at 1145? 
 EPMI/Comed capacity deal was never filed (EPMI has no current requirement to file). The owner of the facility never filed anything on the assumption that there was an oral, short term arrangement.  FERC requires approval for assignments in excess of $50,000.  Does this help?

 Hi Andy  I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.  PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have met during this process. 
 Harlan cancelled lunch  - How about playing tennis earlier and skipping lunch 
 power marketers are not required to file 
 Hi Chris - Hope all is well.  Are you and Tracy coming to Texas ... for the conference? 
 Andy  I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.  I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak. If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one available)  I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye surgery in am so..   but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron building. His number is 713 853 9239.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 fyi 
 yep -hooray! 
 fyi 
 I think it would be a good idea to distribute a sample MNA - maybe you could forward it to Liz Sullivan and see if she can get it in the "package".  I'm not sure about overheads something would likely be nice but I'm not sure what yet.  Lets talk on Monday  Thanks 
 fyi 
 Hi guys  In fear of the future I decided today to go ahead and prepare an outline of things we could talk about on Tues.  An unproofed draft of the brief presentation will be sent to you by my assistant.  Please feel free to mark up, delete or supplement.  On Mon when we talk and divy up parts , each person can then finish out the presentation as they want it.  .  Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in. Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend. 
 Hi Liz  We started working on presentation so still don't know everything yet.  We will likely need either overhead or slide projector.  WIll let you know Mon.  Thanks 
 Hi Cregg  Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better opportunity will present itself.

 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE  Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, and certain "preference payments" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount.  Bill  In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information:  1.  Dat
