 Cindy  I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Cindy  I can play on Wed night if you need somebody.  Also would love to hit on Sat but maybe in a proam tournament at the Met (if that falls apart I might call you and see if you need another body).  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

No change.  Enron Power Marketing, Inc. April 1-5	US$374,720.00 April 6-10	US$374,720.00 March receivables unchanged.  Please call if you have any questions. Bill    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

   Hi Vicki Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.  Talk to you soon and thanks again.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Ellen  I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that right?

  Vicki  As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

 My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Cly= de's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the mod= ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were = starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But= in the meanwhile a preview.  The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin= g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve= ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe= rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall= enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will= be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After= hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne= w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me= et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi= ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide= nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be= able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p= ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  = He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h= im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is = something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c= an begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet an= other name for himself.=20   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Limor  The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of t= he DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version = to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written ag= reement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, sta= rting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters toget= her and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairl= y extensive due diligence review. =20  Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w C= Y.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the= WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought= , rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  = How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion,= but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

 I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

 Ellen  We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.

I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.  pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.

  Hi Martin  Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck. 
 no problem

 The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat .... on your trip ...... tomorrow.   It really is cold you know. My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient) 
 oops 
  Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.  Can you send them the CAISO language.  Should we send other language.  Can one of you attend (I will be on out on vacation starting July 20th) Thanks.  Hope all is well. 
 Hi Andy  I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending "adoption" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).  This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.  I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received  into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th.   Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.   Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.

 Hi John  Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate  mom's IRA into 3 accounts.  Can you email me your SS#.  Thanks 
 Hi Chris  1.  We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.  2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).  Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope. 
 thanks for the vm incredible! lunch next week? have a great 4th 
  Is this the book that was helpful  - should we order updates?

I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks   713 853 6349 
  (in my directory 2001/pg&e/extension1.doc) thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Unbelievable - thanks for the call.  How about lunch the week of July 9th? 
   Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).  Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Larry  Thanks for the email and the first draft.  I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon. 
 Hi Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases. ps Boston was great, thanks 
 yes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed 
  fyi 
   I reserved a court for 500.  Let me know in the afternoon if you can make it. See ya. Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi  Any chance we can play this week.  My schedule is surprisingly free.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 hi grant  I mailed the paperwork to the Y (on Bellaire) on Monday last week per the instructions of the Indian Princess leader at the Y.  I also sent the check for 170.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 unbelievable  hope the end is near - I'll try to avoid calling (I do know your number) until I see Lisa and Sheila back in Houston 
 Thought you might find this interesting 
 fyi for the future 
 THANKS 
 Hi Paul   Hope all is well - I'm sorry I've been so out of touch.  My mom passed away this year and .....  I would love to talk to you this week but I'm on my way to Boston tonight and will not be back until Monday.  Lets talk then. 
  fyi 
 Can you open this for me?  thanks 
  Oh boy

  DItto 
    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Can you help me figure out how to get access to this.  I get this message everyday and don't  know what to do. 
 Hi Peter  We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 CY  These contracts are the CDWR deals that got released over the weekend - I'm glad you have them (I was getting copies from Reliant but I'll wait for yours... it will be really interesting to see how the CDWR deals were done). 
  Alice=20  Please RSVP no for me ( I will be out of town at a wedding).  Which reminds= me.  We always need to send an email to Janette (and Mark? - ask Janette f= or exact policy when I am out of the office for a day.   thanks 
 Alice  Can you call Janice and let her know status. Thanks 
  oops - already done 
 Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words. 
 The system won't let me review these requests.  It says that I am not authorized to review the content.    Liz 
    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 did you book? 
 Thanks for the reminder - I have calls into Bill/Michael but .... no thoughts yet.  Lisa seems to think PG&E has lost motivation to do anything.   High and dry in the HEIGHTS DOCTOR SAGER - available for notes  at any time in exchange for timely (read PRC) testimonials  fyi - we have scheduled our wholesale training session for Wed, June 20th at the Doubletree 
 ok w me 
 Thanks for the words - given my week, my month, my year, I need all the reminders I can to refocus and prioritize.  Hope all is well with you.

    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Oh no.  In the meanwhile,  Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.  Sam misses you.  I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?  I miss you.  I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?  Everybody is fine. 
 done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?  In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call. 
 While I'm still making plans, go ahead and reserve room for August 9, 10, 11.  thanks 
 Unbelievable!  Thanks 
 NICE! EAT WELL! SLEEP SOUND!  ps be aware of hidden hotel costs for internet  - christian in san antonio worked on the internet  for several hours only to be billed $3000 for long distance telephone time. 
 My group calendar is Power Group 
 At the request of Ed Sacks, attached is a draft form of agreement pursuant to which EPMI would be able to assign certain power trades to a third party in order to reduce AEP's exposure to EPMI.

    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps. 
 thanks 
 Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.

 HI Pamela  Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.  Elizabeth 
 Hi Andy  I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help. 
 Hi  THought you might get a kick from this.  Hope you made it home smoothly and spent the weekend playing soccer.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to play. 
 Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there  PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs. 
 Hi  Can you can hit on Wed (lunch or afternoon fine for me)?  Talk to you soon. 
 more(same) of prior email request 
 Hi Kathy  Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Can you review? thanks

 Thanks for the feed back - it may not have been the same Greg Johnston (she said that her Greg had an "e" at the end of his name) 
 FYI  Alice's first day at Enron will be this Friday, June1st. She will be in employee training on the following Monday.  Alice will also be supporting Harlan Murphy, a new lawyer that will also start on Friday.  Thanks 
 Greg and Peter  Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input. 
 Hi  Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the sun set, too"

 Hi Paul  I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 57400. 
  Janet and Genia  Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks 
 Hi John  I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY ), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about invoicing. 
 Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.  On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule? 
 Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back. 
 sounds great 
 Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us? 
 Hi  Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us late? 
 Hi  Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything.

 We are half way home - You passed the drug test (excellent).  Still no news on the background check - but HR will call the service this morning and get back to me. 
 some add'l humor 
 Still sore?  Up for tennis?  I can play Wed or Thurs.  Talk to you soon. 
 thanks for the message - Enron definitely pays expenses.  I will call later to confirm time and possible training session (and also HR update) 
  Hi Paul  Mike Smith told me you would be representing EES in the new credit group.  There is a meeting today at 200 in 3872.  Call with any questions. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Martha I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people got the message that you tried to send today.  Thanks 
 This is what happened last time  when I tried to to send it.

 I got tickets! 
 I'll try again - here is TVA confirm with a few minor changes. 
 Hi John   Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St Clair in Houston could help you. Which one will depend in part on how you think the timing will go.  Thanks 
 Here is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation  Call with any questions.  Thanks

 Hi  Can you make sure we sent a copy of the Newport presentation to him.  Thanks 
 CY   Can you call Larry and find out if he received and if not, resend, thanks. Phone no. is on lower email. 
 I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Yuck - The hearing just got cancelled (I was on the way to the airport when notified) and rescheduled for Tuesday. Right now I'm scheduled to come up on Monday instead.  I'll call you when I know more.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 see you on sat   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Don  Ill call you when I get a moment - back to back meetings until noon but some will get cancelled - in meanwhile under "Discount" we will need to add a column for Discount Rate (which I think will generally be  our counteparties cost of funds)   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 article is ok with me 
 Susan Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response 
 David  I read this article and it looks ok to me - can you also read it (for legal issues and general correct information to the extent you know but not grammer, good writing...) and let me know if you see anything, Thanks. 
  here are some sample letters - this one is Mary's start - she did not go all the way through it. It is based on the PG&E letters.    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Scott  Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.  Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page.  This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   Hi Here are Relaint's comments - let me know if there is anything you want me to do on this.  Thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

  Hi Chris  Hope all is well with you, Tracy and the kids.  How is Addy (opps, spelling is bound to be wrong)?  Are you coming to the legal conference?  And now for the real reason of my email - Can you send me Tracy's telephone number.  I've been wanting to call her for months and say hi but the stupor got in my mind and I couldn't shake it free. Its a beautiful day here today - the first for months and I'm committing to a new .... well, at least a call to Tracy.  Hope to see you at the legal conference.  Did you hear I have to speak?  At least it is with Klauberg.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Stacy  October 23rd would be fine with my schedule.  Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 thanks for the update   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Attached is the PG&E schedule.  Call if you have any questions or  I could be of help.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 looks great - thanks everybody.  Alice will you send out to group from me.  I'm so busy you see ....   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Joy  Ella and I will be there on the 20th.  Thanks. Also, sorry for the delay on getting the $7.00 to you - its in the mail today.  Thanks again for everything. 
  This was sent to me by a friend in NY - I thought it was a helpful  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 I think Mary's idea is good - like with Calpine, we can just let them know that the draft is only for consideration.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   hope this helps   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Hi guys  This week doesn't look good for a lunch doubles date but how about next week.  Does Tuesday next week work?  If not, how about Thursday? Talk to you soon.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 no problem   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   Ugh.  Where were you - things again got ugly on market disruption (brokers or dealers permitted up to 4 each with no requirement of equal numbers).  In the meanwhile, credit annex meeting has been established for Nov.1 at the Marriott on Coronado Island.  Talk to you soon. Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Peter  I am going to be out of the office the rest of this week but lets talk early next week about this .  Thanks Elizabeth 
 HI  So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.  Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Joanne  Thanks for your message - I will not be able to attend but when available would be interested in borrowing the tape. Thanks again.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Vicki  I looked Ed O up in the directory and he was listed as an EES VP in origination. He told me Mark Taylor told him to call me to get information.  Sound OK? Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi talk to you soon   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Ed  As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349. 
 Great - I'll see at 345 on Thursday.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Bill  Are you talking to PG&E about post petition power invoice?  I understand the Canadian receivable post petition was paid.  Is that right?  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi in anticipation of some next step   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 OOPs again - I gave you my phone number.  My fax is 713 646 3490.  Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Brenda  please download this document and put in my directory in new file EEI Contract.  After pulling down email copies to Sandra Hrna and Robbi Rossi. thanks 
 Hi  Can you still play today? I could play at 12:30 or in the afternoon, say 3:00 or 3:30. Talk to you soon  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 how about 330? 
 Instructions per SW.  I assume she is referring to the time submitted by Taffy.  Jeff H is my immediate supervisor. Thanks 
 Chaundra must have accidently forgot to forward to you. 
 Hi How about Tuesday at 1130 ( I'm meeting with all Enron power traders on Tuesday at 400 to explain the EEI contract - oh boy, that will be a blast). If that doesn't work I can also play on Wed. See ya 
 I can meet at 1115 for 30 minutes.  I will be in my office.  Tell him to call me here and if we don't finish we can resume later 
 She'll love it! Talk to you soon. Have a great weekend. 
 Hi Brent  Hope all is well.  I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls, usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all the other general terms and conditions. By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.  Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston  (Thanks Leslie)      Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/04/2000 09:43 AM 
 Lisa Thanks for the notice. Please add Janice Moore and Shari Stack to you list and delete Lou Stoler. Thanks Elizabeth 
 You both have been added to this list 
 Hi Want to play tennis next week? Wed/ Thurs,  lunch or afternoon works fine for me. Let me know. I'll give you more details later but the meeting with the traders went reasonably well. See you soon Elizabeth 
 Mitch  Give me a call when you get a chance, re the Gleason letter (I'm not sure I've left voice messages for you at the right place). Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 That would be great.  I have court 2 for us at 330.  Let me know if we need to change it; otherwise I will see you there. Elizabeth 36349 
 Jim  Friday morning would be great for the Gibbs & Brun lawyers to meet with Tabors.  They have been speaking to him about a meeting in DC next week but if we could do it here it would be fantastic.  Let me know if you can get Tabors to stay over.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi  I talked to Grant and we are definitely considering coming up assuming we can make it work with your schedule.  The week you are in BI may work out great. We will get back in touch with you as soon as we check the details.  Thanks for the great offer and encouragement. I'm praying we can make it all work out.  Ella is a size 8.  Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.  Liz 
 Oops. Address for shipping is  822 Columbia Houston TX 77007  Ella will be so excited to get a package/swimsuit - Everyday now she asks if she has gotten any mail (she loves opening things and the idea that the world is sending her things)  Thanks again and hope to see you soon. 
 David  Can you look this over. Thanks 
 Tues at 930 or 200 would be fine. thanks 
 FYI 
 This is the subject of the meeting w Larry for 230 today on 31 in control room 
 Christian I'll fax my comments to you re this in the nest 30 minutes.  After you receive, call with any questions. Thanks 
 Janice  You could help Christi et all on this Thanks Elizabeth 
 David  Could you please look at this? Thanks Elizabeth 
 Hi John  Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call. On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to. Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.  Talk to you soon.  Hope all is well.  Elizabeth 
 Please print attachment and send copies to Richard Sanders, Mark Haedicke and Bob Madden. Thanks 
 tues sounds great 
 Leslie Can you please forward to the appropriate person 
 Can you print this? 
 Brenda  Please turn this into a draft in my TVA letter file.  We will work on later this later today. thanks 
 Please review.  If OK I will send down for signature.  Sager

 At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an "Into Product" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available on the EEI web page).  The only other definition of an "Into" product of which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page or the definition published by NYMEX for its "Into Entergy" product.  If you have any questions about the "Into" energy product that is so commonly traded in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg "Into Entergy", "Into TVA", "Into Cinergy", "Into ComEd"), please don't hesitate to call me.

 Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable    Hi Tim  Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA.  PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).  Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Phone is busy so ..... Will have agreement shortly.  Please send fax numbers (no electronic  copy) where you want it sent.  Hope all is well. 
 I can go the 11th  Happy Birthday BG 
 fyi 
 Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable  Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks 
 per my vm 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT  Please review attached memo and provide me comments early Thursday morning. Kevin and Rodgers saw an earlier draft and I do not want to recirculate to them for their final review until we have all legal input. Thanks 
 Attorney Client Work Product Not Discoverable  Dave As explained in Presto's voice mail, attached is a brief memo discussing the proposed offer to TVA and a draft offer letter.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 thanks 
 Confidential Attorney Work Product Not Discoverable  Attached is a preliminary draft of the Legal Risk Chart.  You will need to open this in "Read Only mode"  Richard and Jeff -  As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise. Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with your written comments.  Thanks for your help.  Elizabeth 36349 
 Confidential Not Discoverable Attorney work product  I spoke w Richard - he agrees that Stuart should wait until after 5 BD to talk to the City and that it is ok to manage the position as we see fit. 
 FYI  TVA did not send notice of MOPA exercise for the summer 01 period 
 I rec'd notice and will be attending meeting as will David Portz with Enron. See you there. 
 per my voice mail 
 Hi  Charlotte  The week of the 16th looks good for me.  How about Wed. the 18th at 6:00 pm? If this doesn't work, I'm very flexible that week.  Let me know.  Thanks and I look forward to playing.  Elizabeth  ps  I'm out the rest of this week so lets confirm early next week. 
 Hi  Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail. Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.   Looking forward to seeing you Friday. 
 Can you send him a hard copy (He is w Constellation)  thanks 
 Could you also please send a copy to Andy 
 The 17th at 630 works great for me.  See you there. 
 ok w me 
 sounds great - enjoy  ps - Statement of Commitment sure looks interesting - what ever happened to indicative pricing and terms 
 Have a great weekend eating soggy hotdogs in misty, damp weather, dreaming of Genia on her cruise, all the while wondering about the meaning of quality time.  See you Monday am, not sharp.  Bye 
 Here is a draft of the PCA brief prepared by Dewey (head law firm of group effort).  Sam Behrends at Laboeuf is reviewing ( we just got today so he has not done so yet).  Sorry I didn't call you earlier about this. 
 Janice Moore and I have been helping Mitch w a proposal to connect Caledonia to Southern.  There is another project to expand the facility that we are not working on - I think maybe Sheila's group has that one.  Call me or Janice with questions. 
 This request from Shari is fine with me.  Could I also request a flat screen for my new office?  Thanks for your help.  Let me know what else I need to do. 
 Tennis on the 17th at 630 sounds great.  See you there. 
 fyi if you did not receive from shari 
 can you arrange this for after 200 or on friday thanks 
 oops sorry  marks' number 816 527 1314 
 Welcome back - I will call you later this afternoon.  Do you think you or Steve could look at this stuff relating to something in the WSCC 
 Thanks for the update.  So far, we are still trying to schedule meeting s w PCAs lawyers so there is no date certain by which I need the information. When we have one I'll let you know.  Thanks again. 
 Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable  Top Legal Risks  1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak. Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination damages, broad performance outs.  2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as to which entity is liable for which trades.  3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.  4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.  5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on a very tight time schedule.  6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on how to document transactions involving power.  7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure everybody understands risks associated with transactions.  Documentation Projects  1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen reliance on WSPP.  2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual transactions that are not part of a master.  3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power product definitions.  4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all e-trading.  5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  - work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll that into single contract for physical and financial trading 
 Hi John  Thanks for the call.  I'll be in Thursday all day after 10:00 (dentist in the am - yuk).  Lets try to get together then on the agency stuff. 
 Hi Susan  How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.  Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .  Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well (wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think. Sager 
 Per keegan's vm, here is the only thing we handed out.  Let me know if you want to discuss. 
 Just in case Hope all is well 
 See you between 200 and 230 
 Janette  Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you. Thanks for your help.  Elizabeth 36349  PS Mark  At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It seems that there is alot of interest in this idea. 
 Hi Tim  Thanks for your message.  We absolutely will forward to ISDA your message so that you can receive notices of the Energy Product meetings ( I thought you were already getting them).  Look forward to seeing you again soon.  Elizabeth 36349 
 I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.  Just FYI, depending on  the trade we would likely like to  add product definition (eg West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).  John  When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved. 
 Hi Dede Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week? How about Monday (anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya. 
 Welcome back - hope your sojourn was not alarming (NY is not that bad a place to happen upon independence),and the autumn leaves made you smile. Talk to you soon. 
 lets do Mon at lunch.  call you to confirm. 
 Still on for 1200 today?  Court 3.  See ya there unless I hear from you. 
 Hi Alex  THANKS - Ella rec'd the bathing suit and loves it.  She put it on and wouldn't take it off.  Perfect size.  Perfect gift.  WE ARE COMING - hope that's still OK.  We finally booked our flight to NY. We are planning on coming up on Sat. July 22nd and leaving on Sunday the 30th.  Not sure of the plans from there but will call you later.  If this doesn't work for you guys, let me know.  SO EXCITED about coming.  Talk to you soon. 
 $20 gift certificate to Oshmans (I'll start Ella's career with only the finest racquet available).  I wonder what the A PLAYERS get. 
 Hi Stacey  Outside counsel wants to schedule a meeting on the PCA calculations this Wed, the 25th.  Will you be able to have the data retrieved by then? Let me know asap. Thanks for your help. Elizabeth 36349 
 I thought this was to go to Dina. Sorry 
 OK w me thanks 
 Hi Andy  I was hoping when you get a chance, you could give me an update on where things were left at the recent meeting in DC and where we are going from here. Also, are you are anybody else thinking of going to Ontario as they try to work through creating a Master Power form. 
 please print also 
 Hi Charlotte Thanks for your message.  I can't play Tues (Halloween night with the kids - they would never forgive me).  How about Wed, Thurs, Friday, the weekend or a week from this Tues.  Let me know what works for you. 
 Bob  Here is what we sent TVA last year when we were notifying them of the delivery points we would have delivered to.  I'm tied up in meetings the rest of the day and we want to start notifying TVA of the delivery points we would have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver energy under the MOPA,  Could you please revise accordingly and send back to Bill Rust and me this afternoon,  We would like to start sending out tomorrow. As always, thanks for your help. Elizabeth 
 Thanks for your help - the comments were great. The only one I didn't understand was to "D".  Please review my revised draft and let me know if you think this works. Thanks again. 
 sounds like fun 
 Looking forward to playing at 600 on Wed, court 12. 
 good luck.  please acquire food. 
 Hi Carol  Was just wondering if you wanted  to play tennis, maybe sometime next week (I'm trying to get excited about something next week - work has been very busy and I need to fill in it with other things).  Let me know if you want to try and play. Hope all is well. 
 reservations for the 19th 
 Dede, per your vm, here are our draft West definitions.  THESE ARE VERY MUCH IN DRAFT FORM.  I WILL DISCUSS WITH YOU LATER Elizabeth 
 Elizabeth Sager with Enron will be attending 
 any interest 
 any interest 
 Hi Carol  How about Wed, the 8th? 
 Hi Melanie  On PCA, the dates proposed w Richard are generally fine with me, so .....  On the Rockets, thanks very much   ...... my husband and I would love to go to the Hornets game (16th).  Thanks again for lunch and I will talk to you soon. 
 Hi Christian  Is this thing for financial or physical trading  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Mark - for your approval  1.  Trip for me to San Diego to attend WSPP meeting.  2  Trip for Shari to Portland in November while Christian is on Thanksgiving holiday.  Thanks  ps - I will schedule a meeting with you this week to discuss Shari/staffing in Portland office. 
 Meeting on 9th from 10 -12 has been scheduled. Thanks 
 please schedule for me. 
 Genia  Can you please forward this to all lawyers in the power trading group.  Thanks 
 Mark  As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Janette I'm not sure what you are looking for but here is brief description for power trading  ENA's Legal Power Trading group supports all of Enron's U.S.-based, wholesale trading legal requirements.  Enron is the largest marketer of wholesale power in the U.S.  This group currently has 6 lawyers (one located in Portland). Responsibilities include negotiating master trading agreements and structured power transactions, interfacing with industry trade groups to develop business practices and managing risks associated with the world's most volatile commodity.   Let me know if this is sufficient 
 fyi 
 Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing. 
 THANKS 
 I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely will eventually make the EEI contract the "default" contract if there are no other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.    drusso@reliantenergy.com 10/30/2000 06:07 PM 
 5:30 would be fine - I've changed our court time.  See you then. 
 please send thanks 
 I will be there. 
 I could make 1100.  Janice is out today so we can meet today without her and I will update her.  Let me know when and where. 
 please print 
 There are cheap tickets to DC (160) this weekend and I was wondering if I should go.  My mom says she is just far too busy for me to come.  She is alone and Bob is not coming back until next week.  What do you think. Ugh 
 Jim -  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am not aware that there is a "formal process" for being a board member of a non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks    James D Steffes@ENRON 10/30/2000 08:13 AM 
 Chris  Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous conversations with a Greg Malcolm there and he has said that they are very interested in contracting with EPMI using EEI.  He and Shari have a call scheduled for Nov 20th.  Just curious. 
 Steve and Christian  Could you please review and let me know what you think of this?  There is a call on Thurs at 200 (Central) to discuss.  Do you want to participate? 
 I'm available on the 8th 
 Tickets were still available so I'm going.  Commitment. 
 Regrettably, Enron also can not participate today - Monday does not work for me either but in my absence Shari Stack could participate.  Let me know and I will coordinate schedules with Shari. 
 I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we intended.  More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.  On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to "Canadianize" it, thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.  PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going? 
 As always, thanks for your help. 
 Hey I just realized I have babysitting on Friday.  Any chance you can play? 
 how about anytime between 2 and 3 Houston time.  If not, I could also do 1130.  Let me know 
 2 hours later my crown is on, my teeth are happy but for the #3 upper right molar, which the dentist says, unbeknown to me, is abscessed.  I now need a root canal.  Soon.   That will make 562,003 to 1.  Happy playing 
 please sign me up 
 please print 
 Still waiting on numbers, but wanted to see if this explanation would work,  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Elizabeth 36349

 Just FYI - I'm going home.  No tennis tonight for me. 
 CY please work through w Tim thanks 
 Hi  Do you want to try and hit on Wed, either at lunch  or after work 
 fyi 
 See you at 1130 unless I hear otherwise. Thanks for getting it set up. eas 
 Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable  A. PGE  I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the underlying contracts":  1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million  2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million  3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million   II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):  1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million  2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)  3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000  4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)  5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 million - see contract 2 above)  6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million  8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)  9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million  10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)  11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)  Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent (PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need to verify actual contract language.  B.  SCE Default  SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland General. 
 looks great.  thanks for your help. 
 is the tournament on Sat or Sun or both? round robin? thanks looking forward to hitting tomorrow 
 please print 
 lets discuss this later thanks 
 fyi 
 Peter, just a follow-up to your email.  1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master.  2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing). This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool fails.  Just FYI, the god awful "Into"product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable. 
 Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a basketball game and dinner in the offing.  Talk to you soon. 
 done 
 I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just let me know and we can find another time. 
 Rodgers As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 see you there at 4:00 unless I call you 
 yuk.  so sorry to have to cancel that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 430 call to wrap it up don't they know we have better things to do here is to getting back on track after thanksgiving sorry again 
 per my vm 
 ? 
 Mark  Here is a revised draft of the CDWR risk memo.  Events change everyday. This morning's paper reports that a rate increase of 40% may be imposed by the CDWR as early as today and the new bond issue amount is purported to be 16 billion (rather than the 10 initially discussed) 
 Mark As we discussed, here is a copy of the draft memo. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 see you there on court 10  ps I may have to come back to work for a 615 call 
 Here is latest draft of risk memo (STILL IN DRAFT FORM).   I faxed comments to you on dash.  Do you have any current info on deal status?  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 no problem 
 Hi Mike  I am definitely coming out for meeting on Monday - if you want to hit/play before meeting let me know and I'll bring my stuff.  See you there. 
 MY MEMO 
 sounds great .  see ya there. 
 Hi Carol  I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).  Good luck on your search.  ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after Thanksgiving. 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
 log sheet and written verification letter to come later - give copy of script to Mike or whoever else will be securing quotes 
 I would think so but not sure - it sounds like DP is in US 
 Thanks for the documents.  If OK w you, I will look at during my flight on Sunday and will call you on Monday am  if I have any comments.  If this isn't OK, please leave me a voice mail and I will try to review earlier.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349  PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it an""EEI Canada"?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in the name of the organization that "approves" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to get EEI's approval/consent. 
 Jeff  I enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to Houston.  As promised, here is the information about the Ontario meeting regarding the creation of a Physical Power Master for Canada.  Don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts or comments.  Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
 Attached is draft escrow language for Black Hills that I made up in an attempt to be sympathetic to Black Hills's desire for certainty on the release of funds - please review and call Shari with comments first thing on Wed.  I will be travelling Wed but will check messages on Wed afternoon. Good luck 
 At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input. 
 Hi  We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing invitations now.  Here it is:  Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo? Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer to  ..... shop.  PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday. 
 Thanks for your message  Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator. Coaching seems to be his real passion.  I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are scrambling to find a birthday concept.  On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - let me know when you can.  Talk to you soon. 
 Let's try for thurs at 1130 - call me if you need to change time/date. 
 Sorry for the delay but here it is  - A good landscape architect in the Heights is Pam August (husband name Todd) who lives on Cortdlandt (sorry no number) between 7th and 8th. 
 HI Just got this message - email at home couldn't open attachment.  Go ahead a send rest when you can, no problem.  Hey, will you send me your new address. thanks 
 I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.  PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi. Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think. 
 Mark , I assume that I should continue work on this. If its OK with you, I would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for physical/financial(maybe) trading. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do. 
 Attached is a brief memo I prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled for Wed., May 23rd, to discuss setoff issues.  Please call if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 per our discussion 
 Chi is now confused.  She want to do the wedding but is feeling overwhelmed by all the issues:  Mom Her sickness John Short notice for all involved creating tension She and Douglas feeling stressed as a result of above Mom  She seeks advice from a sage Midwesterner.  What do you think - Delay or hasten onward 
 Sorry I didn't get too far but What I read I think is looking great - good luck 
 Hi John  Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a meeting.  The Black Hills deal is still stuck in credit land so I will call the Denver office if need be.  Thanks again and I look forward to speaking with you soon. 
 Hi Charlotte  I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week.  PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too  See you soon 
 That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to play.    drusso@reliant.com 06/05/2001 01:55 PM

 Hi Phil Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000 with the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are invited with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more leisurely morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them home. If we were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.  Let me know what you would like.  thanks 
 I'm going to DC at 400 on sat.  Julie can stay till 600 -I have a court at 430 but if you can get there earlier that would be great.  See ya

 Kaye Please forward the attachment Thanks 
 I'll get on it Mon.  Have a great weekend. 
 Genia  Please forward to person who is looking at Midam  Thanks e 
 Please review and forward comments to me early Thursday morning so we can distribute along with a copy of my explanatory memo.  I will forward a redraft of the memo to you for final review prior to distributing to John L and Dave D. Thanks 
 Janice  Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll. 
 Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of a draft confirm that we use with TVA. 
 Any way you think Andrew might like power trading?  His resume looks strong. 
 Thanks for resending message.  I look forward to playing later in December 
 Yeah  - go ahead and see if he wants a challenging position in a rewarding place. Thanks 
 absolutely.  see you on sat around 530.  ps - wildfires not just there - I've heard as well over here. Congratulations 
 I'm not sure about Sat - Grant has been trying to get a sitter - he called Lynne and Cecilia.  Are you going? 
 Hi  Thanks for the good news - It pleases me to know end to be creating EEI babies throughout the world - bandwidth is also using it. Hooray Brenda should have sent a presentation I did that summarizes EEI - Hope its helpful;avoid the DISASTER - it only applies in the US. Also, Andy's article may be helpful.  Have a great weekend.

 Mark  Attached is a draft of the chart of power risks.  Let me know if there is anything else you would like me to do on this.  We are still in the process of reviewing top exposures with credit.   Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi Charlotte  Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the same onslaught.  When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.  See ya 36349 
 sounds great  but let me check w Grant and I will call you tomorrow 
 Dinner on Sat would be great. Lovely xmas card. 
 So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would likely give her some barbiesque items  for the reasons you stated (she's going to get them from somebody someday). 
 FYI  - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on finalizing Shari's move to Portland.  Shari is looking for a "relocation" package.  HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that works.   HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H and then present to Shari. End of Feb is still the target date.  Hope all well (despite the press).  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi Shari  I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS 
 Thanks for your message - sorry to hear your schedule ( I thought mine was bad).  No problem from my side not playing until 2001 - let's talk that first week and arrange a time.  Hope you have a great holiday in NY. 
 enjoy the snow 
 With pleasure.  822 Columbia Houston Texas  77007 
 Hi  I'm thrilled you are also speaking at ISDA.Thanks  Any chance you can hit on Wed? If not we may have to resume our REGULAR WEEKLY SCHEDULE after the holidays.  Let me know. 
 Thanks for dinner on Sat  - As always, Grant and I really enjoyed getting together with you guys.  Lets pretend its my birthday in January and go again.  See ya 
 Hi  I would love to but don't think I will be able to  - we leave for DC on Friday morning.  How about the following week? 
 EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE "the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate". What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap.  I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are "artificially" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue.  Thanks for your thoughts. 
 Mark  Attached are my comments to your Hypotheticals. Call with any questions   Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Attached is a chart showing how I thought the PGE assignment could work. Let me know what else we can do.  Thanks 
 I think attachment is missing since I didn't get confirm.  Check w genia re paper - I think we have something but is skimpy 
 You are correct on the facts PGET pays a higher price to Morgan than EES pays to PGET - hence the payment to EES 
 thanks  we will likely need to simple corporate help as well to work on assignments/termination - if possible maybe you could get somebody to assist to also be on call.c 
 As promised.  THANKS    713 853 6349 
 per my vm 
 David  Could you work with Joe Wagner on this.  thanks 
 Attached are drafts of documents that we prepared and LLGM fixed.

 Hi David  FYI - Janice is out until the 22nd of Jan. so when you are finished with comments, please send them to me as well.  As soon as we have the "live" deal give me a call and we will see who has availability to assist you.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 please call after reading 
 All done? 
 This is another TVA letter.  Can you please put in my directory, add our standard addresses and heading and set up for signature for Kevin Presto VP .  I will work on editing letter after you fix format. thanks 
 Hooray

 Credit contact person is William Bradford at 713 853 3831 or you can call me at 713 853 6349. 
 thanks 
 John  I think the letter looks good. I made a few changes which I am enclosing.  thanks 
 Preliminary draft not yet reviewed by EES - let me know if you have comments  PS - Powerx deal is not one of the assigned transactions.  thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Please deliver to Peter ASAP thanks 
 I think it would be better in a side letter so as not reinvovle Avista at this point and raise any new issues - is that ok 
 Thanks again for all your help 
 Hi I am here.  We are closing tonight.  Call when you can.Thanks 
 Here are the revised documents that we will need EEMC to sign.  Please coordinate signatures w Travis.  Thanks Elizabeth   36349 
 FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages. Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing to all parties.  Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.  Thanks again. 
 the e-mails sent by Rogers Herndon are encrypted and cannot be opened. 
 Hi Angela  Sorry I did not get back in touch w you earlier - my mom passed away over the holidays and I have been out of the office and don't know exactly when I will be back (definitely out the week of 15th).   I look forward to playing and will call you when I get back to play. 
 Bill told us last night the true up payments run to PGET 
 documents prepared by Shari w LLG help, sent to Avista  (i just found that out) 
 Andy  Sorry to get back to you so late - I've been out of town and will be out all this week as well.  A meeting on  14th/15th in DC would be great for me. Just let me know.  If you need to reach me this week - just leave me a voice mail at 713 853 6349.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Any idea where EES is on this this am - I'm meeting w Mark H now to discuss. 
 please print 
 fyi - we have right to terminate EEMC power positions assumed by EPMI and have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if they don't help us on the collateral issues. 
 Sounds like a great idea - I'll talk to Grant and let you know.  Meanwhile can you hit this week?  Let me know. 
 please distribute to whoever you think would be interested. 
 Hi Andy  I would be happy to participate in whatever session/role in either or both Atlanta and/or Newport that you think would be helpful/appropriate - just let me know.  Thanks - Hope all is well. 
 I'd love to - Nothing bigger than setoff now. 
 Thanks for the words of encouragement 
 I approve this request but I am unable to access website.  Please advice what I should do. 
 Absolutely  - lets get Marcus involved.  With all the activity in NEPOOL and Leslie being out, I was thinking that Marcus should be the other NEPOOL expert. 
 FYI I was also helping on this deal as was Jason. Thanks Elizabeth 
 goes with other email.  thanks

 oops - i can't today but another day yes.  i'll call you later. 
 I will 
 Still working on it - I'll let you know final results soon 
 final settlement date is 2/16 i hope not 1/16 - thanks 
 Thanks - hope to see you soon 
 thanks and congrats too 
 thanks for the words of encouragement 
 Hi Paul - I am alive  but barely.  California is dark and so and I. Hope to talk to you soon. 
 have a good weekend 
 sure - could be interesting 
 Brent - I didn't work on the deal but I think it was a deal we did with a Florida company, maybe Florida Power likely in 96.  Melissa Murphy or Kim Theriot may be able to help locate.  Let me know if I can do anythin else. 
 how about thursday lunch? 
 Harlan - Dede is out this week - how about I take everybody out for lunch on Tuesday and we can figure out what to do for speech.  In the meanwhile, I'm going to give ISDA the charts we used at last ISDA meeting for distribution and Dede is going to get copies of various US agreements to ISDA.  Let me know of Tuesday works or if not other open day.  Thanks 713 853 6349 
 please print and put in binder with labels thanks 
 Hi John  Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?  I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works for you. 
 Richard just told me that we settled PCA.  That's great news but I will miss the opportunity to work with you.  Thanks for all your help on this matter and I hope we get to work together again on some other matter in the near future. 
 I don't know much but I think Dan Lyons is well versed on this.  Also maybe Dale R in Portland.  Hope all is well. 
 I'm open all day

 How about meeting for lunch on Tues at Ruggles (on Main) at noon? 
 how about 400 
 I do have a conflict so 400 would be better 
 after would work great for me 
 Hi John  You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time so....).  Now that you are back,  I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be shattered. Meanwhile,  I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.  And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at  900 Houston time to discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?  If not, no big deal.  Talk to you soon. 
 sounds great meet you on Smith at 1145? 
 EPMI/Comed capacity deal was never filed (EPMI has no current requirement to file). The owner of the facility never filed anything on the assumption that there was an oral, short term arrangement.  FERC requires approval for assignments in excess of $50,000.  Does this help?

 Hi Andy  I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.  PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have met during this process. 
 Harlan cancelled lunch  - How about playing tennis earlier and skipping lunch 
 power marketers are not required to file 
 Hi Chris - Hope all is well.  Are you and Tracy coming to Texas ... for the conference? 
 Andy  I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.  I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak. If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one available)  I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye surgery in am so..   but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron building. His number is 713 853 9239.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 fyi 
 yep -hooray! 
 fyi 
 I think it would be a good idea to distribute a sample MNA - maybe you could forward it to Liz Sullivan and see if she can get it in the "package".  I'm not sure about overheads something would likely be nice but I'm not sure what yet.  Lets talk on Monday  Thanks 
 fyi 
 Hi guys  In fear of the future I decided today to go ahead and prepare an outline of things we could talk about on Tues.  An unproofed draft of the brief presentation will be sent to you by my assistant.  Please feel free to mark up, delete or supplement.  On Mon when we talk and divy up parts , each person can then finish out the presentation as they want it.  .  Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in. Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend. 
 Hi Liz  We started working on presentation so still don't know everything yet.  We will likely need either overhead or slide projector.  WIll let you know Mon.  Thanks 
 Hi Cregg  Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better opportunity will present itself.

 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE  Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, and certain "preference payments" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount.  Bill  In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information:  1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we received from PCA would have been around May 20th).  2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.  3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)  As always, thanks for your help. 
 I sadly will not make dinner on Wed.  Brenda Whitehead should have sent updated bio but by copy of this I will ask her to resend.  Thanks

 Hi Andy I received this email but for some reason I can't open it.  Today is my last day in the office until the 22nd.  Can you resend this to me and I will look at it when I get back next week.  If it can't wait that long, go ahead and send to David Portz and he may be able to assist you. Look forward to talking to you soon. Elizabeth

 Andy  Sorry I missed you on Friday.   My panels are fine the only problem is that I'm on the 12:10 flight back to Houston on Friday (So is Dede I think)  Is there any way we can make second talk on Friday earlier or else Dede and I can speak first and then step off panel? 
 CY  I'm not sure - I kind of think we need to keep going to some of these meetings, if nothing else to educate the industry and to listen to the western crowd.  With limited resources we will need to figure out which ones but ...  Talk to you later  ES 
 Can we talk about this in am (tues)?  Do we have a template? thanks

 GREAT NEWS 
 My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.  A trusted companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet "O's", he looking for food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' voices began.  Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month feels.  Hopefully this to will pass.   Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.        ps - Great work on WAPA;  I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR will close.   I hear Skilling told Portland that he loves trading and promises resources.  Oh my. 
 Anything I can do? 
 I have a dr appoint at 1215 for which I likely wont be back in office until 130.  Can we have it at 130

 I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to blame .... You are welcome as always to come by anytime to watch the tears (maybe you will happen upon another fine hour like when I accidentally killed our goldfish on Sunday) or to pick up the ladder. 
 Peter  Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.  Hope all is well.  Elizabeth  713 853 6349 
 Ship it up.If you want it we could look up blue book value and then figure out an appropriate valuation.  If you don't want it, you are Chi could sell it in DC or you could use it for a trade in.  If shipping is expensive and you want to fly down and drive up, I will pay for flight. 
 lets discuss later today

 Hi Carol!  Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.  See you soon Elizabeth 713 853 6349

 I'm going to Portland this week and will let you know how that goes and whether we should post. Thanks 
 Hi Harlan  Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into meeting.  I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.  He would propose that he, Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work for you.  Happy trails Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 We did settle w PCA - I will get $ from Richard and let you know.  I'm still thinking about waiver letters; my instinct is not necessary but ... I'll call later.

 FINAL 
 please put on calendar 
 Unbelievable error - best laugh all day.  Thanks 
 great - here is brochure.  I will try to get list of attendees so we can see who is going; usually in east, crowd is primarially legal and credit; WSPP meetings in west however generally have more commercial ... so I don't know if Stuart would benefit or not but I would love for him to come if he wants. Talk to you soon. 
 I can meet at 900 on Thurs.  I will be out of office from 1030 until 300 and then back thanks    "Laura Gibson" <lgibson@ogwb.com> 04/10/2001 04:36 PM Please respond to lgibson 
 Dale and Nicole  I unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the document you sent  Can you either resend or get me a hard copy.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 monday around 10 also works for me 
 I'll send you the attendees list when I get it from EEI - meetings in the West frequently do have many "commercial" folks as well as lawyers and credit managers.  It is a great way for the lawyers to network. 
 for you, anything - I accept 
 Hi Dede  20/20?  pretty amazing isn't ? Can you play tennis on Friday? Talk to you soon 
 help? 
 Hi Sami  Can we get together next week to discuss?  How about Mon at 1030? 
 Thanks for your message.  Hope all is well.  I don't think I'll be able to have dinner on Thurs (Grant is coming) but thanks for the invite. Looking forward to seeing you in Newport. 
 no survey present when I open site - please advice 
 Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about product but without definition).  OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.  We do not commonly use those definitions 
 Mark  I am not aware of any contracts similar to those described by Sharon. 
 Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an "Into Product" is and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet with Dynegy.  As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.  I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:  1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.  2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice against the Into definition.  3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an RTO)  Call me with any questions/thoughts.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Only 53 signed up so far but here it is - frequently more arrive at last minute.  Steve Marcus Nettelton is doing EOL while Leslie is on maternity leave.  Have a great weekend 
 fine with me 
 After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM and other rights to interrupt.  Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).  ps  if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.  Thanks Have a great weekend. 
 I'm sorry I thought you might still be here.  I'm travelling the rest of this week so how about April 24th or 25th next week? 
 fyi 
 Lets do it when you are in Houston on Monday 
 Hi Mike  Dede and my husband and I are all bringing our racquets hoping to get in some tennis on either or both Wed and Thurs? Can you join us?  Let me know. 
 great 
 One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in the Casino.  And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found. Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out of my hands.  I fought and won.  I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.  May Shelby be with us all  providing sustaining .......  es    Christian Yoder 04/16/2001 11:12 AM 
 Can you get EEI and cover sheet and riders to Carol thanks es 
 Hi Carol  My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call any time.  This heat is unbelievable. I've become weak in body and have recently only played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.  Just FYI  I will be out of town next weekend but around after that.  Anytime you want to play, just give me a call.  Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme volatility in Western power prices,  I can think of nothing more pleasant then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.  Go Davenport.  Lets hope Martina fares as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.  Elizabeth 36349 
 I'm out this week giving a seminar - the head of the rival power form WSPP and me Miss EEI are giving presentations on why our documents are the best. Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the better form)  so it looks like we  will have to push it till the week of the 23rd  Any day that week is good.   Way to go again on your sweet victory this weekend. 
 Thanks for yesterday - It's a wonderful tradition that I look forward to every year.  Also, I spoke w Pam and does Tues at 700 work for you? Thanks again 
 Thanks for the book and bikes - Ella is in love with the bike with the basket.  How about lunch next week? 
 absolutely - see you at your house as darkness falls 
 I'm thrilled - see you in Newport (when do you get in?) 
 how about Wed, April 25th 
 Thanks for the explanation.  Can you also get the actual interest rate used for each group on terminated transactions (eg the financial trades, the power trades, the US gas trades and the Canadian gas trades).  Thanks    Tanya Rohauer/ENRON@enronXgate 04/16/2001 06:16 PM 
 Bill  I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.      William S Bradford/ENRON@enronXgate 04/16/2001 07:35 PM 
 Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E. In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all the matters in one letter.  For each product line,  I thought we could attach all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter:  1.  Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC 2.  Copy of transaction confirmations 3.  Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E 4.  Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s) 5.  Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same 6.  Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated trade 7.  Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle) 8   List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the extent available, written confirmation of such quote  I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.  Thanks for all your help.    Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
 THANKS 
 Go ahead and sign it - I did.  The law in Va. is that once appointed you can not revoke (I spoke w counsel on this). Mom's probate estate is very small.  thanks 
 Hi  Any chance you could hit Thursday or Friday? By then I'll also have the scoop on Newcombe's clinic.  Talk to you soon. 
 great - how about Thursday lunch 
 Hi Harlan  Tuesday, Sept 12th from 2:30 to 5:30 at your offices works fine for us.  Lets reconfirm Monday afternoon.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Still on? Hope so - let me know where you would like to go (I can meet at 1230 or thereafter) 
 See you at Redwood Grill at 1230 (I've never been there!) 
 CONFIDENTIAL/NOT DISCOVERABLE  Attached is letter that went to PG&E yesterday - It will not likely get disclosed unless PG&E elects to go public with it.  We are continuing to have discussions with PG&E about this letter and are planning to meet next week.  Call with any questions.

 Copy of PG&E letter 
 Mark  Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should distribute the memo.    Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Sara  I need to cancel my reservation for Wed. night.  Do you do this or should I? 
 Thanks - you even used the same minuscule type that I love but everybody hates.  My weekend is going great and now I think Mon will be OK too.   Hope you also had a good weekend.   Talk to you on Mon. 
 Peter  I just remembered I have a Dr appointment on the 10th at 400 - can Derek make it at 300 
 not yet but soon 
 Attached is draft agreement - If possible, I would like to get this out to Larry within the next hour ( I promised to send it first thing Monday am). Thanks for your fast review. 
 Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing = a=20 revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20 Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:  (1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a= =20 reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20 settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20 proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an= =20 agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re= solving=20 a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be= =20 =01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can= always=20 extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to= =20 make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution= . =20 Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the= =20 extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement= itself =20 (as opposed to this letter).  (2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t= he=20 parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and= =20 that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20 revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi= on=20 Period=018 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had provided that Enron wou= ld be=20 required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b= e=20 reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20 Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed= =20 to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t= he=20 parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20 contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to ke= ep=20 in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of= a=20 termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part= y.=20 See Sec. 5.5.  (3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron =01&agrees=018 to enter in= to new=20 master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on =01&commercially= =20 reasonable terms.=018  The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to=20 negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations= =20 towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron=01,s part to ef= fect=20 a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the=20 parties=01, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed t= o=20 this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac= h=20 of the parties.   Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin= g=20 or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for your help in moving this= =20 forward.

 Attached is ENA legal's general posting for assistant positions - let Molly know if you want to make any changes.  I have not yet spoken with Molly but would like to move forward with hiring an assistant asap.  Molly said she had some candidates so ....

 Sounds great - I was at the Met last night doing drills and reserved a court for 1130 - also, wasn't sure it this would work, but Dede and I have talked about having one of the pro's in training (Micky) drill us and I spoke with him and I think he would be available.

 Here is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation  Call with any questions.  Thanks 
 Hi John   Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St Clair in Houston could help you. Which one will depend in part on how you think the timing will go.  Thanks 
 I'll try again - here is TVA confirm with a few minor changes. 
 I got tickets! 
 Here are proposed revisions.  Give me a call after you have reviewed. Thanks       Richard Ring@EES 05/15/2001 09:07 AM 
 OK with me - go ahead and prepare final version and then Joe and I will meet with EPMI to traders.  Thanks    Richard Ring@EES 05/15/2001 03:39 PM 
 Hi guys  I just remembered that we talked about playing today (1030?) Can anybody make it?  If not, let's try to reschedule.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon. 
 Mark had the memo sent of Friday to the Executive Committee and all VPs. 
 I can play any time today  - I'll call you when I hear back from Christy 
 great see you there 
 thanks 
 Hi Shari  Thanks for the message - I can do lunch next Thurs.  Are you still free? 
 As per your instructions,I have approved the purchase request for the following:  One (1) Black/white Network Printer HP 4100N Cost Center No. 0000107061 Price - $1,503.00 USD  This purchase was requested by Martha Keesler and the printer is for Genia FitzGerald.  If you have any questions regarding this, please direct the e-mail to Martha Keesler at martha.keesler@enron.com.  Thank you, Elizabeth Sager 
 This is what happened last time  when I tried to to send it. 
 Martha I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people got the message that you tried to send today.  Thanks    Martha Keesler/ENRON@enronXgate 05/17/2001 09:40 AM 
 thanks for the message - Enron definitely pays expenses.  I will call later to confirm time and possible training session (and also HR update) 
 Still sore?  Up for tennis?  I can play Wed or Thurs.  Talk to you soon. 
 Hi - Thanks for Sat. - that was fun.  Can you play Tues or Thurs lunch? 
 some add'l humor 
 We are half way home - You passed the drug test (excellent).  Still no news on the background check - but HR will call the service this morning and get back to me. 
 yes - Christian Yoder is going 
 we will meet just to make sure nobody has anything they want to talk about, so it should last hardly at all 
 ENJOY 
 Hi  Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything. 
 Hi  Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us late? 
 Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us? 
 Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back. 
 see you on court 2 at 12:00 
 Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.  On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule? 
 Hi John  I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY ), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about invoicing. 
 Janet and Genia  Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks 
 Hi Paul  I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 57400. 
 Carol  Can you sit in on this call with me ?   Thanks 
 Meeting at Ella's school on Thursday June 7th @1130 w Ms Pickett, Tatum and Ing. 
 As with any pearl, and in your case, enough has been said.  Given everything, else don't fret over this one. I have already enough ammo. 
 any interest 
 Please help me - I can not get access to approve this account.  Why not?  I am his supervisor and can get access to others accounts

 Hi  Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the sun set, too"    "Brock, Alex" <abrock@PoloRalphLauren.com> 05/29/2001 03:10 PM 
 Greg and Peter  Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input. 
 FYI  Alice's first day at Enron will be this Friday, June1st. She will be in employee training on the following Monday.  Alice will also be supporting Harlan Murphy, a new lawyer that will also start on Friday.  Thanks 
 Thanks for the feed back - it may not have been the same Greg Johnston (she said that her Greg had an "e" at the end of his name) 
 Thanks for this - as you suggested earlier when I get a break I will follow-up on your earlier email, re WEST TEAM with Carol as support, and send out another email.

 Hi  Can you can hit on Wed (lunch or afternoon fine for me)?  Talk to you soon. 
 Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there  PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs. 
 Hi Andy  I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help. 
 HI Pamela  Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.  Elizabeth 
 A couple of minor changes - let me know if this is OK with you and then I will discuss with Mark Haedicke.  Thanks  ps blacklining seems to be all messed up but I tried    "Williams, Stephen E." <sewilliams@mcguirewoods.com> 06/05/2001 10:04 AM

 Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.  I'm working on insurance coverage now.  My appointment at MD Anderson may conflict - can you make it if I can't? 
 thanks 
 By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.    Paul_Puchot@enron.net 06/07/2001 11:28 AM

 Tennis plan looks great.  Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.  No problem.  I played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.  Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll resend.  Just let me know. Thanks 
 Leslie  Do you have a hard copy I could take w me tomorrow to DC (valuable plane time work) Thanks 
 Unbelievable!  Thanks 
 While I'm still making plans, go ahead and reserve room for August 9, 10, 11.  thanks 
 done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?  In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.    Christian Yoder/ENRON@enronXgate 06/11/2001 04:10 PM 
 Mark and Jeff  Here is information I rec'd regarding the upcoming EEI meeting on Friday May 7th.  Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi Karen  Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others regarding contract standardization.  Your analysis is historically correct but recently we have changed our policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.  Let me know if you need any thing else.  eas 
 I  believe this contract has been executed - Kenton was the lawyer working w Paul P.  Let me know if you need us to track it down.  Give me a call anytime to discuss the industry in genreal  eas 36349 
 Sheila  I may have mispoke - I thought you were talking about the power contracts.  I don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w financings, but I could be wrong. let me know what else I can do. 
 not a thing yet 
 Genia  Kenton worked on this contracr - do you think you can find this.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Melanie  In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to arbitration for all issues.  When we first started trading power we limited arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going. Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.  I only raised the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject to the arbitration provision or not.  In conclusion, based on today's policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any reason for us to be concerned with preserving  an argument of limited applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.  I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Elizabeth asked that I request a copy of the above document at your earliest convenience.  She will be leaving the office around 11:00 am this morning to go out of town and would like to have the agreement to review.  Please let me know if I can be of assistance in any way (ext. 3-5438).  Thanks. 
 fyi thanks eas 
 fyi thanks eas 
 Sorry for the late RSVP, but I will be attending the drafting meetings on Tues. Thanks Elizabeth Sager Enron 713 853-6349 
 sorry to say but  I haven't heard a thing 
 large thanks esager 
 I wll be attending the meeting. Thanks Elizabeth Sager Enron 
 Jeff FYI 
 Thanks Anything fine but if individual orders are being followed, a large salad with vinaigrette dressing and some maque chou (sp?). 
 John I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.  This is the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC concerns.  Let  me know whats next. 
 John I'm not in on Friday so is there another day?  Also without wantingto be too bold, I will say that we have been down this path before and we just can't have a preestablished termination right (unless it is a Default) with financial payment. 
 brenda please print these thanks 
 Robin  Thanks for your voicemail - here is the final ERCOT Agreement. I'm still thinking of responding w more legal comments but at this point I think the door is pretty much shut. 
 FYI Stand ready, stand firm. 
 Sorry for the delay in responding.  I am having my assistant Brenda Whitehead fax to Paul asap a copy of the presentation - if you need something else just let Brenda or me know. 
 Sure.  By copy of this letter, I am asking brenda to forward it to you. Thanks Brenda. 
 brenda please add to chart thanks 
 per our discussion yesterday 
 Here are my comments What do you think eas 
 Here it is (copy machine on the blink) 
 I would be very interested in working w Patty on going line by line through the draft Master. Thanks Elizabeth Sager EPMI esager2@ect.enron.com 
 Kevin I thought the letter was great. No comments. 
 As always, thanks. 
 here is a draft.  let me know what you think.  I know i don't hvave the name of the third plant correct but ... 
 Hi Sorry for the delay.  I have a meeting scheduled w Exxon for next Thurs. at 1000.  Do you want us to tie you in? Elizabeth 36349 
 John Dennis and I spoke last week but I had to canacel the Thurs meeting due to an unexpected out of town trip.  Dennis is to call me to reschedule.  Sorry for the delay and I'll let you know what comes about.  Elizabeth 
 Shari  Can you follow up and see what they want us to do on this ( I know its AEP but since its west, I thought you could do it most easily ... let me know if I'm wrong) 
 As promised, here is a copy of what we filed -sorry for the delay - lots of travel recently. A question for you on the meetings on the 28th and 29th - I am assuming the meetings will be in DC. Is this correct? Thanks and I hope all is well. Elizabeth 
 "A long time to wait" - thats what Ella says all the time, only she's usually wrong and you are definitely right.  In the process of becoming dedicated to nothing but dispute resolution it appears I've lost my civility  .... imaging that  ..... becoming just like so many trial lawyers.  How about Monday the 12th?  Sager 
 Hi Geoff Sorry for the long delay - Things have been unbelievably hectic.  This week in looking better. Do you have any time this week to get together. How about Tuesday? Let me know what works. Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Here is a draft of where we are thinking of going with WSPP Firm.  Give me a call to discuss.  Thanks.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349. 
 Attached is a first draft.  It is likely heavy handed but we can chop down from here (don't want to scare NERC away but need to set the record straight). 
 Hi Geoff Give me a call at 713 853-6349 when you get a chance.  I'v beend trying to call you today but the number just keeps on ringing. Hope all is well. Talk to you soon. Thanks Elizabeth 
 Brenda Will you please print these out for me.  Thanks 
 Please print 
 Mark  FYI regarding Jim's new role. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 FYI Have a great day eas 
 Privileged and Confidential.  Attoney Client Work Product.  Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this afternoon.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi Dennis called me to attempt to reschedule.  Conflicts in schedules led him to leave me a vm saying he will call me when he gaets back in the office next week.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Thanks for your email.  I'll be out of the office for the rest of the week so when you find an answer, just let Bonnie (37422) White know.  Thanks. Elizabeth 
 FYI - I'm out of the office the rest of this week, in on Monday and then out all the following week.  My assistant Brenda knows where I am.  If you need to reach me either leave me a vm and I'll return the call (I would love nothing more than to be execused from the painful standardized contract meetings I will be attending) or else call me on the cell phone 713 854 5747.  Bob Madden is the outside lawyer on the TVA MOPA and control area and you can call him at 713 650 8805 if you need to.  He is currently working on the declaratory judgement petition and is aware of the possible timeframe. Have a great week. Sager 
 Please print thanks 
 Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the slow and steady march towards a standardized, "national" agreement. Schedule C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the following is a summary of where the group is headed.  After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP group is currently reviewing:  Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under this definition.  Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the "optics" are necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one Schedule.  Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following discussions:  1.  Generated vs. Sold - "Sold" was elected over "generated" because the group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the generator's reserve requirements.  2. "Schedule"  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.  3.  "Reserves" instead of "Operating Reserves" was used because the group thought the word operating may be too restrictive.  4.  "WSCC reserve requirements" was replaced with "applicable" reserve requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in scope and should not be limited to WSPP.  5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would accept a non-firm supply as being firm.  6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision that has already been made.  This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Thanks. Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi  I really enjoyed playing yesterday -thanks.  Can you hit on Wed. afternoon or Thursday lunch or afternoon?  Talk to you soon

 Mark  Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power contract developed through EEI.  You will note that EEI listed you as a potential speaker.  EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349

 materials for DC meeting 
 Genia  Can you get with Ed Hearn on this and start the process rolling - I think he was the one that set up Enron SE - if not give me a call.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Never mind.  Thanks though. 
 Elizabeth Sager and Lou Stoler from Enron  will attend the meeting on Friday. Thanks 
 John  Your interpretation is correct based on my understanding.  You may want to call Dennis to just check in.  Dennis did say that he would include Enron in any bid packages prepared. 
 Met at 430 - Yes. Court . Under the Cox name. Vacation - still thinking. See ya 
 FYI - Brochure for EEI meeting in November. 
 Here is the draft.  As always, thanks for your help. Elizabeth 
 Hi Christian  Thanks for the email and voicemail - look forward to seeing you in Oct.  This EEI contract is a still a progress in work.  Last week's meeting resulted in still more changes. New draft is being prepared and will be distributed later this week.  Contract "rollout" is in Nov.  Its raining here. First time in over two months.  I think I'll leave today in celebration.  Sager 
 I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to recommence the project we began in January to review the existing Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have received a black binder labelled "Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas Forms"  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have changed since then but have not undertaken to "update" the memo as we will be able to discuss such changes at the meeting.  The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences. The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's "model" trading provisions should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in mind, I would hope to be able to create a "modular type" contract  whereby each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  "modular assignment section" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.  You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.  Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to assist us in this effort.  Thanks 
 call in number is 888 237 7001, access code 501 104 talk to you later 
 Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; only my "enemies" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch up this week.  Hope all is well for you.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi Smith  If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know what does.  My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.  We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.  In March Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring in people internally.  Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers move into the group.  As a result of this shift,  we are not currently looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll let you know.  Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, asset  development).  If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you back.  Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand ...  other organizations may be hiring.  I will be up in Portland, next week.  Maybe we can talk then  Again, my apologizes on the long delay. 
 SCEM - Sonnet Edmund's can be your first stop.  She has a new person who you will likely work with but I forget his name. 
 This is likely the last opportunity we will have for comments, so if anybody has any additional comments, please let me know no later than the end of the day on Wed, Oct 13th, and I will forward all comments to Caroline on Thursday.  Thanks for everybody's assistance on this effort.  Elizabeth 
 I'm only available from 2 -245 on thursday the 21st.(sorry for the trouble but my daughter has a doctors appointment on thurs and I'm not in on Friday) Thanks Elizabeth 
 I will be able to attend by phone (subject to kid noise in the bakground however).  Please leave me a voice mail at 36349 to let me know phone in details.  Thanks Elizabeth 
 It would be my pleasure to have you on the call. I asked Caroline if we could do it at 300 houston time.  Hope that works. Elizabeth 
 Christian Can you review this and let me know if you are ok w this for online trading. thanks e 
 Sorry for the delay  Handicap - a very poor player  Food - Water, Heinikin and turkey sandwich w cheese  Thanks Elizabeth

 Attached is draft.  Want to review with Bob before we send out.  Thanks e 
 Brenda wuld you please fill this out and send to Zal. 
 Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of November.  As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the definition of an "Into" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them.  Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near. 
 Please print thanks 
 Please see this attached bio: 
 Final version for your files of the ERCOT Trading Agreement. 
 Marty Despite best eforts, I have not been ableto revie the definition yet and likely won't before Tuesday when I'm in DC.  I'll let you know when finished.  Thanks Elizabeth

 Hi Melanie  I received your draft answer and am still trying to verify numbers.  When do we need to file?  Thanks   Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 per my vm es 
 hi 
 Thank you 
 Christi  Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would like more information  (Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)    *EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar has been assigned the matter.  *The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).  *The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.  *EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999. 
 As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a manner similiar to other control areas.  One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC policies are a "contract" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined that NERC policies were indeed "contractual obligations" (e.g., a third party claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC "contractual policies").  It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me with any thoughts or comments you have.  Thanks for your help.  Elizabeth 36349  CONFIDENTIAL;ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT;NOT DISCOVERABLE 
 Patty and Harlan  I received your emails.  1. I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions.  2. I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point.  3. My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO definition.  I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday. If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise given current work committments.  I will let you know by Thursday afternoon if it looks like earlier is doable.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Thanks  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Into product should be distributed to Andy and Patricia Young.  Emails in this email 
 Draft Definitions should go to all the peole on this email both as "to" and "cc". 
 Hi John  Thanks for WSJ article.  Now if only you could notify senior management over here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as well).  TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you now.  We have to send out on Thursday.  Do you have time to review and we can discuss tomorrow.  Thanks 
 Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product description meeting on Wed.   I would guess that the bulk of the meeting will be spent on the "Into" definition, which draft was prepared by David and myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other product definitions (unit firm and system firm).  If you have any questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me. 
 Hi Dede  Dana Davis is the trader that is coming from Enron.  Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Elizabeth 
 Richard Here is where Genia got on fax room search.  Lets's talk tommorrow about where to go from here. Thanks 
 As you requested, attached as "INTO4R" is a draft defintion of an INTO Product that I prepared for EEI. 
 Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension of deliveries under the MOPA.  Please review and call me with any questions or comments.  We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th.  The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review.  CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVLEDGE

 Enclosed are revised documents.  Below is a summary of changes made.  Copies enclosed are clean copies.  Please carefully review all documents so that we can next move to final execution copies.  Thanks for everybody's help.  Revised Physical Confirm  Changes Made:  1)   SET-OFF Paragraph (B) - First sentence deleted and the phrase "of the Master Agreement" added after the reference to Section 4.2 2)   Definition of Business Day - changed commas to parenthesis 3)   Definition of Year added 4)   Exhibit "D" numbers added and the name of the Exhibit was changed to Option Premium 5)   The phrase "as amended" added in the first paragraph with respect to the definition of the Master Agreement 6)   Definition of Summer Season amended to delete NERC definition because NERC is already defined 7)   Exhibit "C" - (a) First sentence modified to reflect the fact that the Daily Energy Charge calculation will vary depending upon whether a given Month is in the Summer Season or the Non-Summer Season and (b) the phrase "where," or "and where," was added three times immediately prior to each set of definitions.  Revised Financial Confirm  1)   Added the words "shall be" in last paragraph of Section "Energy Quantity". 2)   Deleted proviso in Section "Cash Settlement Amount for each Energy Index Point." 3)   Added phrase in (b) of Section "Billing and Payment" to show that payments could go to Seller from Buyer and in (c) to add words "as amended". 4) Added Exhibit III/Option Premium.  Schedule to ISDA  Changes Made:  1. Added ENA as specified entity ML (Part 1 a). 2. Fixed names in Part 1 (k) from ML and Enron to Credit Support Provider. 3. Add notice for ML (Part 4/a). 4. Reference amendment to Guaranty (Part 4 (f)). 
 Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the Power Master (already in existence ("Old CSA")).  1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA ("New CSA"). Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in place between ENA and ML.  2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA. Revised Schedule attached.  3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document named "Power Amendment 1).      (black-line version) 
 As we discussed, enclosed are execution copies of the documents that we have been working on.  Please review, and if acceptable, have an authorized officer of ML execute each of the enclosed documents and return to my attention at fax no. 713 646 3490.  We will follow up with hard copies.  Thanks for all your help.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349

 great 
 Hi  Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against other Gains and Losses.  Happy New Year e 
 On?  Name the time (400?) and the spot (Met?)  e 
 At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA.  The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.  If you have any questions, please call me at 36349. 
 Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it (lunch will be served) 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or is contemplating taking relating to TVA:  Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA)  Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker  Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of notice)  Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface issues  If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me immediately.  Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,  Elizabeth Sager 36349

 Surpassing last year's record will be easy.  Great to see you as well and Feb 2 looks great.  Lets talk on the first.  713 853 6349 
 What time 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT  Here is the draft TVA petition covering all 3 issues we have with TVA that we are planning to  file tomorrow, the 27th.  Please call me no later than than 9:00 with any comments.  Thanks  Sorry for the short notice 
 Thanks for the comments Elizabeth 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional claim, EPMI needs the courts approval.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE  Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.  Copies of the letter will be distributed later .  Elizabeth Sager 36349

 Hi Andy  I read through all of your Article this weekend .  What a job!  I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Janel  I'm not sure.  I thought the meeting was being set up to coordinate efforts between regulatory, legal and ENA and EES.  The meeting was requested by Christi Nicollay.

 lets discuss at 130 
 As promised, here is rough idea of deal.  Terms have changed since this was prepared.   I will keep you informed as the deal progresses. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 nothing I know of 
 fyi 
 Tuesday works great for me.  As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet finished, revisions to Product B.  I have several questions and will need input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.  I spoke w Harlan briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the "one-time, good faith effort" to find an ADI.  I will call Harlan and Marjie to further discuss.  A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Today its my turn to be the goof - today I can't make it.  Sorry.  How about tomorrow Sager 
 pretty skimpy but here it is. 
 Sheila  FYI.  I will forward to you the written reviews I have done.   Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 I did say Thursday right?  Thursday noon? 
 brenda please set up in mydirectory as the next TVA letter 
 Please call me with comments concerning the following two letters: 
 Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show changes from Fred's last draft.  The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the proposal being held  "open" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).  Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of "Green Requirement".  Fred - I wanted to stick to "would" instead of "will"  as the operative verb in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal.  If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.  Elizabeth 36349 
 Fred I don't think we have to wait, but if time permits we might as well fix. Elizabeth 
 Christi  Could you please email the TVA draft letter. Thanks If I don't talk to you before you leave, have a great trip. 
 Hi  Will you call you later to discuss 
 positively - how about early monday? take care Elizabeth 
 At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests. This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this afternoon if possible  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Andy  As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.  The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:  1.  Changed  the Section entitled "Performance Assurance" to "Collateral Threshold" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral.  2. Added the words "acceptable to Party ___" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party.  3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are "Applicable" or "Not Applicable".  As always thanks for your help. Elizabeth 713.853.6349 
 Thanks 
 brenda this would not print for me. would you try 
 fyi lets discuss later 
 Hi Leslie  I would love to but I'm not sure right now about my schedule. I'm moving offices and everything is a mess.   I will call you if it looks like I can get away.  If not I'll call (or please call me)  in a couple of weeks (I'm out all next week).  See you soon  Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
 please call me w any final comments 36349 
 A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains "substantive" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the "deemed accepted" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language. The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote. 
 Let me know if there is anything else I can do Thanks Sager 
 Enron votes no. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
 In what I'm sure is an oversight, EEI forgtot to send me a ballot. After appealing for my right to vote, a ballot was forthcoming.  I voted "NO" on the proposal.  We will see what happens from here.

 Tuesday, GAD's only birthday request was for an "old-timey" chocolate cake" (the kind that's not very good but she likes anyway). Today, on reflection, she asked for oysters.  Grant's special ones. All my hard work and you get the fame. 
 another request - delegate as you feel appropriate thanks 
 I hope so. GIve me a call sometime. I could have lunch today, the 28th.  Can you? 
 I,m jealous of your beautiful dog, but do you have any pictures of family? Lunch tommorrow is out (standing in line at post office to get passport for trip to Paris).  Next week I'm mostly out (trip to NY with daughter Ella for wedding of girlfriend I've known since I was Ella's age) but call me anyway or I'll try to call you. PS As you can tell, work is a low priority right now, so .... let's go! 
 oops, a little slow 
 FYI in case you hadn't already heard 
 Hi  Gave Jackie's resume to Mark Taylor.  Did he call her yesterday?  I'm out this weekend w little "Eloise" (only the finest); let the 60's live! 
 Hi Dede  I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project.  On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) at lunch?  Let me know.  Hope you have fun on Friday night.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.  This agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.  Call me at 713 853 6349 if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
 John  I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.  Talk to you soon Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi John  Thanks for the email re TVA.  As usual, things got behind me last week so I wasn't able to move the TVA letter forward.  I have  promised Kevin something by today - so I may be calling you this afternoon.  Hope all is well  Elizabeth 
 Hi Dede  Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a roller-coaster of an airplane for over 5 hours fighting a "terrific headwind" according to the pilot.  See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.  Elizabeth 
 As promised. Call me when you want to disucss. FYI - The letter is very "lawyerly"; I'm not sure this is the right approach though.  Let me know if you think this tone will do more harm than good.  Paragraphs for you to consider are in brackets. 
 Kevin  Richard Tabors number is 617 543 5304.  John Basinger and Barrett Reasoner with the Gibbs and Brun law firm would like to get a hold day with him ASAP.  Thanks for your help  Elizabeth 36349 
 Hi  Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a mess.  I think I better work on that shot.  Tennis on Wed.?  Elizabeth 
 There is no guarantor for NHEC.  I have not received the form of LC.  Issuing bank is National Rural Utility Coop Finance Corp. Thanks Elizabeth 
 Sounds great.  See you on Wed. at 1230 unless I hear from you. 
 thanks 
 good for us 
 Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten untold grief for using HOUSTON).  See ya at 1230 
 Yippee 
 thanks 
 I would love them if still available 
 Robbi  Sometime on Wed, Thurs. next week would be fine to get together (I'm out early next week doing the last of the roadshows on the Edison contract - I can't wait for the process to be over - it has been going on for over a year).  Call my assiatant Brenda Whitehead at 35438 to schedule a time.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349
