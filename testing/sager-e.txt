 Greg and Peter  Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input. 
 Hi  Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the sun set, too"

 Hi Paul  I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 57400. 
  Janet and Genia  Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks 
 Hi John  I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY ), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about invoicing. 
 Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.  On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule? 
 Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back. 
 sounds great 
 Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us? 
 Hi  Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us late? 
 Hi  Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything.

 Hi  Can you make sure we sent a copy of the Newport presentation to him.  Thanks 
 CY   Can you call Larry and find out if he received and if not, resend, thanks. Phone no. is on lower email. 
 I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Yuck - The hearing just got cancelled (I was on the way to the airport when notified) and rescheduled for Tuesday. Right now I'm scheduled to come up on Monday instead.  I'll call you when I know more.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Don  Ill call you when I get a moment - back to back meetings until noon but some will get cancelled - in meanwhile under "Discount" we will need to add a column for Discount Rate (which I think will generally be  our counteparties cost of funds)   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349
