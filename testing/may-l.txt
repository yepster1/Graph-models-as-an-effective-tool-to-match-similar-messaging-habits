 Dear Mr. Reeves,  As per our conversation, could you please forward this e-mail to Dr. Leerburger.  Thank you for your help.  Lawrence May 14542 Kentley Orchard Ln. Cypress, Texas 77429 Home: 281 379-1525  email: ljnmay@aol.com Work: 713 853-6731  email: larry.may@enron.com  Dear Dr. Leerburger,  I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr. Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston, Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events of the last few weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate any time you may spare.  Sincerely,   Lawrence J. May 
 Fair enough,  Thanks

 Dear Dr. Fidas,  I spoke with you a few days ago concerning my interest in the Sercurity Policy Studies program.  I am going to be visiting the GW campus the afternoon of Thursday Jan 24th and would like to know if you would be available for a few minutes.  Also, you had mentioned you may be able to pass on my resume so I am attaching a cover letter and resume (the cover letter better explains the relevance my business and military experience to an intelligence position).  Ljmay1.doc is the cover letter and ljmay2.doc is the resume.  Thank you for your consideration.   Lawrence May  713 853-6731 email: ljnmay@aol.com

 As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules.  Thanks,  Larry 
 Please enable Flecther Sturm to sell options 
 This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.  In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes.  If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.  Thank You,  Larry May
