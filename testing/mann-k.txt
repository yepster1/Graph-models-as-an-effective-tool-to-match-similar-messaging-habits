 $2.8 million. 
 One project co is good enough.  ckm 
 There is one completed unit going into TurboPark.  The address is listed below.  Kay 
 I would line up CA next.  Let me look over what Lee sent then I'll call (or you can call when you get free).  How was the game?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Dave,  Here's the change order we would like to process today.    Thanks,  Kay 
 Resending since you didn't get it earlier.

 I know how to get LJM's signature.    Enron North America Corp. 
 This is really weird.  I do not know why I can't find your email with your comments (I really think I saw them), unless it blew itself up (or operator error on my part).  I will look for a hard copy.  Kay 
 He asked me for the comments. 
 Re:  ESA.  Getting close. 
 I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too long to address the immediate issue.  I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.  Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm just wondering what is public info.  Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his vote.  More to come...  ckm 
 I hope so, too. 
 Mitch,  The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.   How does this sound?  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here's a good place to start.  I'm including a memo from Andrews & Kurth, our outside counsel who drafted the form.  Thanks,  Kay 
 David,  I believe you sent me some comments to the Fuel Cell equipment purchase contract.  I now cannot locate those comments.  Could you resend them?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Janette,  I'm available.  Kay 
 I'm thinking GE said "no". 
 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055 
 Sounds good. 
 Will do. 
 Attached is the proposed change order with ABB.  See you at 900am tomorrow (Monday) in my office.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think asking David the question is a good idea.  Kay 
 I'm working.  Not a choice, a necessity.  Good night to grill...  ckm 
 Stinebaugh? Steinbaugh? 
 I forwarded the email to GE and received no comment back.  Kay 
 FYI.  Most recent versions.  Matt, sorry I missed you call.  Roger, does signing the letter agreement cause any balance sheet problems? We anticipate closing a few days later.  Kay 
 ENA should sign them tomorrow. (I assume you are referring to the TurboPark set?) 
 Michael and I had a great time at the zoo.  It was great to not watch the clock.  Thanks,  Kay 
 We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).  Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of stress for you two.  I'll manage Coral and Ben.  Please advise.  Ciao,  Kay  PS.  Just in case you don't know, your efforts are very appreciated.  Not just by me! 
 We would like to have the conference call at 200 CST on Sunday.  Any problems?  If not, can you get the word out?  My number at home is 713 973 6325.  Kay 
 A reminder:  900am Monday, my office.  3882  We need the spread sheet on the transformer payments, please.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Could you email me the option agreement? 
 I was going to suggest that we inbed some wiggle in the specifications, but no big deal.  Kay 
 I left Dave Onuscheck a voice mail about the issues, and asked him to give me a call. 
 There are 13 LM's resident at 16415 Jacinto Port Blvd. Houston Texas.  I'm working on the transformers.  Kay 
 George,  I agree with your suggestion, and will make the request to GE.  Kay 
 I need:  the current total contract amount and the payoff amount. 
 While we were on the phone I sent GE an email about the issue.  Kay 
 Ben, are you available at 9am on Monday re ABB?  Thanks  Kay 
 I'm expecting John Schroeder from GE between 2-230.  I really need to see him, so please watch for my phone so it doesn't go into voice mail.  Thanks,  Kay 
 At the risk of making you crazy, I've come up with a suggested rework of the term sheet, as I was having horrible problems with formatting when I was doing revisions.  Now all I have to do is fill in the blanks.    I'm ready when you are.  ckm 
 There may be a possible bust in 17.4..  Specifically please look at how the math works on the refund due to termination.  I think that the baseline should be the maximum liability amount, or whatever the proper term might be.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is the procedure for taking something out of TurboPark about the same as WestLB?  Kay 
 OK with you guys for me to add this? 
 You may have told me the answer to this already, but is there a spreadsheet for the transformers similar to what we have for the turbines?  Thanks,  Kay  PS  Herman and I are swapping voice mails about scheduling something today.  Kay 
 Please send it on. 
 YIKES. 
 Thanks.  I'm on my way to see Lee and John Schroeder, so you can reach me by my cell if you need to.  Have fun at your daughter's school. How much fun is that!  Kay 
 Please include these names on the distribution pthompson@akllp.com and ccobb@akllp.com  Thanks! 
 Hi Rebecca,  Is email from around 400 yesterday the final version of the payment schedule for the LM's?  I need to get the facility agreements organized, and that information is obviously important.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.  In the meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.  This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.  That's why it is first in line.  We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).  Also, I'm going to try to get ABB focused on doing their facility agreements.  I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the turbines to confirm the payment terms.  I hope to have it this am.  What is your direct line?  Kay 
 Today I'm going my GE's offices, so I'll be in late.  If the deals I'm working on permit (3 are supposed to close next week), I would like to take as much time as possible off the week of and after Christmas.  I won't take off all that time.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good morning!  I was wondering if Michael has settled down, or if he is having troubles attending.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Ben,  I got  a call from Mike, and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number.  He is very interested in the change order, of couse.  Do I have the pay off number?  What would be a good time to talk about the ABB payment allocation with Herman?  I really want to put that issue to be, because I don't know if we can't put the stuff into TurboPark if we haven't taken care of it.  I'm getting GE consent to put the Coral turbines into TurboPark, if necessary. That doesn't mean we have to, but I don't want to take any chances.  How would you feel about not having the 1000 call and just having the noon call? That would give me time to talk to ABB, and we would be able to get the LLC agreement back to Coral.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I left around midnight last night.  Not too bad if you don't have to do it often.  I need to deal with ABB today.  Hope you are sleeping!  Kay 
 I'm about done.  How about you? 
 Ok, eagle eye, here's the override for your one train deal. 
 Ok sports fans, here's a Blue Dog (who named this one?) override letter. 
 Here's the TurboPark consent.  Please call me if you  have any comments, as I want to send it out tonight.  Sheila, I've spoken with Lee Johnson and John Schroeder, and they are lined up to sign at 900 tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay    PS this is consent to send 12 to TurboPark. This gives us room if the Coral deal doesn't happen in time. 
 I just cannot express how wonderful this sounds.  Kay 
 Big whoop. 
 The good news is they agreed to the current form of the acknowledgement letter, and will send us a letter stating they will sign the letter as is when we close on the facility agreement.  I should have that tomorrow.  You win a little, you lose a little.  Kay 
 I was waiting but he did not bring it up.  Probably saving it. 
 Hi guys,  We can't sell the acceleration of the put to GE.  Although off the record they will agree to it, for internal reasons they don't want to go on record with it.  I'll catch up later.  Kay 
 Rose/Cheryl,  Your call.  Kay 
 This is going to be a late night, but if all goes well, it may be my last really late one (plus a little weekend work).  We made some progress on some important stuff.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the ESA Facility Agreement.  Peter and/or Chris, could you please send/re-send the most recent version with a email stating any open issues, copying everyone on this email.  We need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow, if at all possible.  My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the January, 2000 payment.  Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon. That's what happens when I'm not working from my list.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Any info? 
 I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is correct.  If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the timing of the payments.  At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I don't understand the 5% question.  Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out contracts.  Kay 
 Please call me about this when you can. 
 Please tell Mike that I'm on a conference call, but can step out if he wants to come up.  Obviously, I'm in my office.  Please call him and tell him. 
 Please call Sheila and let her know we've made some progress with GE.  Please see if there is time she wants to talk prior to 300 CST.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Steve Swift and Jeff Darst, although Jeff is off the call now. 
 I forwarded your email 
 At the time I asked you to set it up I did not not the Joe Defner and Mike J Miller would be attending. 
 Please see if you can get a conference room for the 300 call.  If there isn't one here, try 28 or 29.  Thanks, Kay 
 This is so nice.  She is one of the lawyers at ENA.  I feel very flattered that she invited me.  Surely it isn't Amway! 
 I saw you didn't get these. 
 Thanks.  You guys are doing great. 
 I'm not that wild about the pan sausage.  Hamburger/italian/smoked are good.  Kay 
 I'm on the phone with GE.  Their initial response to the assignment stuff is positive.  They want a letter which sets out the ownership of the LLC and what we are doing on payment.  I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300, depending on this call.  Kay 
 Can we meet on this today?  We need to reach resolution on some issues.  Kay 
 Hi Scott,  I'm tied up in a call and I don't know when I'll be out.  Hopefully, things will lighten up soon.  Kay 
 That's a lot of money for music.  I wonder how they picked that as opposed to something else?  I'm betting on a Taylor Symphony Hall - that's building money.  ckm 
 Who is the labor lawyer that you guys use, and do they do plaintiff's work? I've had a couple of people ask me for referrals, and I don't know what to tell them.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi,  I'm back.  I'll give you the short version.  I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent Mark and Vicky a  note saying that you  had paid your debt to society and are free to explore other options.  Pretty good stuff.  I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.  Maybe I can lay some ground work.  Kay 
 I have to confess to having Illinois counsel involved. Kay 
 Your thoughts?  Kay 
 Let's discuss in person.  Maybe we should ask Nancy her opinion as well.  Kay 
 Is this the same thing we were working on?  Kay 
 How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it is one thought.  What do you think?  Kay 
 Call me when you can.  Kay 
 Hi Al,  My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for PSCO's break out contract.  If it needs to be paid before year end (which it probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be paid out of TurboPark.  This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at GE, and he is fine with it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sorry, but due to three closings next week I can't be sure I won't be working this Saturday.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Neil,  You have my proxy.  Please let Anthony know what you think.  Thanks,  Kay  Anthony,  Venison would be tough to swallow without teeth.  Kay 
 What a great addition to my day.  I'm getting close to being finished with the year end crises (I hope I hope I hope), and I'm looking forward to fuelcelling again.  Thanks for being patient.  See you tomorrow.  Kay 
 Ta da 
 Hi Mark,  I need to addressee's name.  Is NPC here?  Thanks,  Kay 
 There are discussions ongoing today.  Karen Jones and Sheila are working it, and I haven't seen a recent draft.  It should be ready by Friday.  Kay 
 Hi.  You probably thought that I feel off the end of the world.  Please take a look at this and give me a call.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Question for the team:  If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?  If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with some low dollar hard costs?  I don't have anything in particular in mind, it is more of a theoretical question.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Mike,  I haven't heard anything from Dave.  Could I call him directly?  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI. 
 Doesn't it feel good to delegate? 
 FYI.  Can you make a call tomorrow at 100?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please set up a GE conference call tomorrow at 300, and send an email inviting the the following:  Lisa Bills Roseann Engeldorf Mike Barnas Steve Swift Kent Shoemaker Ben jacoby Lee johnson Sheila  Thanks,  Kay 
 You go girl. 
 I'm a strong believer in the team approach.  None of us are as smart as all of us.  Just left you a message - I'll turn back to finishing the letter before I leave.  Kay 
 Sounds good to me.  I don't see why the buyer would need the redacted information, other than curiosity.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the balance sheet.  Kay 
 I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.  I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!  ckm 
 Not unreasonably withholding consent and agreeing to the assignment are a bit different in my mind.    Enron North America Corp. 
 yes please 
 Opps. Sorry about the confusion.  We are selling the equity in CA to Coral, so I call it by that name.  I'm looking for a list of what you need as referencedin the last line of this email.  Hope that helps,  Kay 
 A taste of exhibits... 
 Chris,  What information is needed for the exhibits to the Coral agreement?  I don't remember. 
 Feed the dogs and kiss Michael. 
 FYI. 
 Here's what we sent them. 
 Nicely done.  Let it fly. 
 You might want to check the payment terms.  Remember this is only for one unit. 
 Thanks once again.  I really appreciate your responsiveness.  In a recent email you mentioned that you had a couple more  changes to the ESA agreement, then we would be good to go.  Can I get that by the end of the day?  Many thanks!  Kay 
 2.  I believe SWPC further agreed that the assignment to the LLCs (and the subsequent transfer of equity) will not affect the terms of the contracts, including the warranties.     Enron North America Corp. 
 Thanks Peter.  I'm actually looking for the Master Agreement, not the initial facility agreement.  I know that Paul (or someone) had converted the original master agreement from WordPerfect to Word.  I thought it would be handy to have the file.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm going I'm going  I'm going 
 Yipppee!!!!  Tonight will be LATE.  It is a real rollercoaster.  Love,  Kay 
 Mike hasn't sent the new assignment language. To my knowledge we had not discussed including it in this set of agreements, so he may have put it aside to work on the consent issues.  Kay 
 Hi there.  Could you send me the Word final of the master GE contract which was the basis for the subsequent facility agreements?  I don't have it in Word- just WordPerfect.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This has sound.  It is totally hilarious. 
 fyi 
 Please send out a reminder of the GE conference call to the following:  Sheila Rose Lisa Scott Mike Barnas Kent shoemaker steve swift Ben jacoby  We don't need a conference room this week.  Thanks,  kay 
 I've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following changes:  Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose, I paraphrased on this. Making the consent effective the later or signing or financing.  I have ZERO pride in authorship.  This is based on ESA, but I would think would apply to TP as well.  I think we should get this to GE no later than 1000 am tomorrow if at all possible.    Kay 
 I'll try to be home by 800 tonight so I can see my baby boy (and his hot daddy).  High class hamburger sounds great.  Love,  Kay 
 This is all I've received on this today. 
 I haven't read this yet. 
 Greg,  You can call me on whatever you have, including Midway, SDEC and Medley Dunn.  If I have a problem getting to something, I'll find help.  Kay 
 The dates are the 26th-28th, so we would be back on the 29th. 
 Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok, and let's go for it.  Jack to the doggie spa, Michael with Paige. 
 Seems like a good guess to start with. 
 Am I begging too much?  Can you mail her package tomorrow?  I meant to ask today, but I got home so late I didn't get things together.  I put one of Michael's airplane pictures in there.  If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.  My mom would love to watch him as she wants him to be exposed to Fort Worth culture.  (a better grade of  bean dip).  I'm very excited!!!!  Love,  Kay 
 Hello.  I would like to receive a brochure and room rates for 2001.  I visited your website and it looks wonderful.  Please send the info to Kay Mann, 29 Inverness Park Way, Houston, TX, 77055.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I know who can sign for EEPC and NEPCO.  I tried looking up LJM2-Turbine and haven't located it.  I'll try to track it down.  I previously sent the letter to the lawyers I believed to be responsible for the entities, so they have some background.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 The security desk downstairs may know who he checked in to see. 
 fyi 
 Team,  Will ESAT still be the signatory to the contract as agent for the Brazilian Power Development Trust, or will the contract be directly between the Trust and GE?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Still working it.  Kay 
 Here's what went out this evening:    Kay 
 The word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance sheet.  If the Coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted. Therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that the Coral transaction will close.  The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor, and he thinks the agreement is fine.  Kay 
 I really like this one. 
 How could resist being part of the Light Brigade? 
 Coral wants some comfort from GE.  This is their proposal.  Kay 
 Please calendar.  Kay 
 Absolutely.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).  Don't know who they will have on this one.  I'm off to the Astros, but would like to visit with you tomorrow, if you will be around.  Thanks,  Kay 
 It needs to also go through Lisa Bills and Ben Jacoby.  It really doesn't matter to me who handles GE signature.  I'd like to get a copy just to stay current.  Plus, it impacts the break out contract (payment schedule and scope).  Kay 
 Frank worked every Saturday when I was at HMRP.

 Hi there,  No news here for me, but I thought you might enjoy looking at the second chart.  Hope you have PowerPoint so you can open this!  Kay

 Hi John,  I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern.  In connection with that transaction, we have prepared the attached assignment and consent, which is patterned after the Pastoria form. We would like to get it wrapped up in the next two weeks, if possible.  Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions. 
 I will be happy to review change order #5, and present to GE for their review and approval.  First, it needs to be prepared by someone involved with the project, and Finance needs to be notified that additional funding will be required, if they don't know already.  As I mentioned in my email, there needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should be funded out of WestLB (prior to December 15) or will be funded through TurboPark.  I faxed change order #2 to Al so that he has the form.  If this will be funded through WestLB, the current contract value is $352,289,400.  Here is the electronic form:    Kay 
 Chris,  We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for this equipment as of now.  Here's co#1:    Each of these units has one dual fuel option.  The master list of serial numbers is in this document:     We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.  I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel option amount.  Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at separate sites.  I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi again,  Have you been asked to prepare the promissory notes referenced in the letter agreement?  If not, please put this on the list.  Also, what else will need to be prepared to close this deal?  I haven't heard for Coral yet, so I don't know if they bought in on closing early next week yet.  Since funding is required they may balk.  As soon as I know something I will let you know.  Thanks again for your help,  Kay 
 I think that him leaving word for Michele might be more palatable. 
 I'm going to leave Sheila a message and let her know about the meeting.  Kay 
 Here's a form: 
 fyi 
 Team,  I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously forwarded to Finance, Accounting and Tax. If anyone who didn't get it would like to get it, please let me know.  Also, I am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this week is the final version from Enron's standpoint.  Any information on that point would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I can see if I can come up with a reason to go to New York if you want to go there.  I know New Orleans has deals that time of year.  There is also Guadalupe River Ranch, and some decent B & B's in Galveston. 
 This PPA has a good overview of scheduling of power (no gas element), and was fully vetted with the power group.  ckm 
 I'm sending the stuff Carolyn did, and attaching the letter revised to specifically reference the January payment.  I suspect that Coral may request language like Carolyn's version, as it tracts the language in the LOI. 
 Michelle,  Carlos would be a great addition at ENA in any transactional capacity.  I worked with him extensively (actually, I hired him), and he is terrific.  Thanks,  Kay 
 A psych student could write a dissertation about that statement. 
 This is for future reference.

 Out of habit I sent this to Lisa. 
 Hi guys,  This is the "break out" contract for the LM's.  This particular draft was prepared for the City of Austin project, but we also need a TurboPark version. Please advise of any comments you might have.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Fuel cells kindle investor energy By Beverly Goodman Redherring.com, November 27, 2000 Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity. And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop reading here. There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that manufacture them. During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices, fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment. Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent since last November. Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq: HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq: PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole picture. "We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before," says William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. "The deregulation in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the combustion engine." Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing) curve. CELL DIVISION The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary, portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter. "We're talking about unprecedented efficiency," he says, noting that fuel cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out). Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50 stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5 percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124. Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP ), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel cell-powered generator to market in 2001. "They don't make promises they're not able to keep," says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at Merrill Lynch. "They've never disappointed." Ballard has also made significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis, a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004, and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices. INDUSTRY REVOLUTION Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit Auto Show, "Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the internal combustion engine." Legislation such as California's mandate that by 2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance. While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5 billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the alternative fuel industry.) "They're involved with almost every aspect of General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and implementation efforts," Mr. Fogel says. Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to return to its high in the coming 12 months. Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now wants to develop a "grid parallel" system, which would work in tandem with the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13 to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate to get that stock back on track.

 I'm not usually a Galveston person, but it might be worth considering in December.  Might be best with Michael, though, so we could go to Moody Gardens and the Strand.  What I don't like about Galveston is the water (duh).  The San Luis is set up for kids, and has a neat view.  Guess I have itchy feet.  I haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks!  All I see at the house is responsibility, and we never do anything anyway.  Any ideas?  ckm 
 I've always thought it was my responsibility to let me supervisor know if I'm gone, not yours. 
 I haven't done anything.  I'm just making suggestions. 
 I have a tolling arrangement to work on. I'm trying to get my hands on the Black Hills tolling agreement.  Can someone point me in the right direction to find it?   Thanks,  Kay 
 I meant a shopping date, no Michael. 
 Maybe we should consider going someplace for a couple of days, sans kids. 
 More info for your file and use.  Kay 
 Wow, I didn't know I could control anything!  Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re stack extensions.  I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.  Is this what you are looking for?  The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange for signature from GE.  The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the next week, or be a change to the break out contract.  I do not believe the cost has been included in the payment schedule.  Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Poor Dan.  He is making himself miserable.  I'm glad he decided to go to the dinner.  I bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues. 
 He needs to stay away from the scales. 
 I think he needs meds, including Prozac or something like that.  He is flat out having an anxiety attack. 
 Here's how the numbers are being handled in another LM deal. 
 This is from my daughter.  ckm 
 Harlan Murphy started last week.  Nice guy from Dynegy. 
 Bad Kay bad bad bad Kay.  I'll do it now.  ckm 
 Don't forget Mama and gettin' otta jail.  ckm 
 fyi.  Please call ME.  Kay 
 I'll have to ask Neil for Michael's SS#.  I don't have it on me.  I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties.  I think one in on the 16th and the other on the 30th (stupid day for a party).  Are those good days for you? I just can't get interested in going to the Enron parties - too many people.  We could really stand some shopping time (bah humbug), also.  Kay 
 Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.  The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts. You do it their way.  There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of loss, insurance, delivery.  I haven't thought through it all, but these issues probably need to be considered.   It may be best to work through GE on a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere. Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any problems or damage.  I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed then.  Good luck!  Kay 
 Peter (or Paul)  Please call so that we can discuss.  713 345 7566.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Michael says that you and he will be putting up Christmas decorations this evening "straight away"  "before nightfall"  etc.  Of course, it is a good thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining.  I was thinking it would be fun to have a family outing this weekend instead of sitting around the house.  Maybe Moody Gardens?  That seems like a fun place to go.  What do you think?  ckm 
 Hi Scott,  Do you want to get together a few minutes early tomorrow to discuss indemnity/LOL, etc?  Kay 
 Did you tell her yes yes yes? 
 And Lisa Bills. 
 Please send a reminder out to Mike Barnas, Kent Shoemaker, Steve Swift, Rose Engeldorf, Ben Jacoby, Scott Dieball, and Sheila, and once again include the instructions (yeah, I know).  thanks,  Kay 
 Opps.  When you wrote back earlier I thought you were responding to me and not Rose's email, so I made a couple of changes and sent it out to everyone.  The Barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the plant (not construct), and I was unclear on the time frame when that had to occur.  I'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we re-traded, and can back off of the changes.  The insanity continues here.  Kay 
 Hi Eric,  I had a computer malfunction and lost your email.  Could you please resend it?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Lee,  Opps.  I forgot to send this to you.  Kay 
 The next step in the turbine challenge is getting a draft working for the ESA transaction. You will find the turbines referenced on the Excel chart as ESA- Brazil #6 and #2.  I am forwarding the serial numbers for those turbines. Please get a draft going on this one - we want to close on Monday.  Rob Taylor is working on this from the finance side.  He should be faxing you some language which needs to be included concerning an agency arrangement. He may also have the names of the assignee and the agent.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I just love the law.... 
 Here's a somewhat refined version, with a reference to the financing reps. Do we want to be more specific?  Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if the proposed assignee: (i) does not have a credit rating of [___] unless (a) the proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with a credit rating of [__], or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability under this Agreement until [appropriate milestone], or (c) is a party participating in or providing financing or financing structures, including, without limitation, structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing, including a special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop and/or construct the project for which Purchaser or Agent purchased the Equipment, if Purchaser or Agent has provided reasonably satisfactory representations concerning the sufficiency of the financing arrangement, or (d) final payment (except for the retention amount) has been made to Seller; (ii) is a direct competitor of Seller in the turbine manufacturing business, (iii) is an adverse party to Seller in any material litigation, or (iv) if purchasing the Equipment, such assignee is not purchasing such Equipment (or rights thereto) as part of a transaction in which Purchaser, Agent or their Affiliates is providing related goods and/or services to such assignee. 
 Will do.  Kay 
 Lisa,  I haven't gotten the executed docs back, but I'll send you the electronic version if that works for you.  Timing is as follows:  Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.  If the closing does not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.  10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days later.  If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment, which we are working on now.  I've given this timeline without looking at the doc, so I will let you know if I missed something.  Hopes this helps.  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 Hi Carol,  I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut case.  Good luck,  Kay 
 Please print and fax this to Sheila.  You don't need to print the attachmen= t.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's what I have for an electronic file of the exhibits.    Kay 
 Hi there,  Can you dig up Peter Thompson's number for me?  He is in A & K's DC office.  Muchas gracias,  Kay 
 Please note.  I called Cher. 
 Have a safe trip back!  Love,  Kay 
 I think he will just tell us that chicken nuggests are vegetables. 
 Here's a new one.  Michael told me he was hungry (big surprise).  I said, "Michael, do you want some turkey?"  He said "No Mom, did you forget that I'm a vegetarian?"   I had to leave the room as I couldn't keep from laughing!  Kay 
 Anything posted on DealBench? 
 Hi Guys,  I can't recall if you have made any revisions to the exhibits.  Please advise (and resend) if you have.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sounds good.  We went to Palacios last weekend.  The water was very silty from the rain, and the tide was low.  There were a few black drum, but not much else.  We did find a stone crab, which was a first.  Kay 
 Hi Peter,  Could I get a compared version of the most recent Austin draft against the original agreement?  Thanks,  Kay 
 You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.  Congratulations on the grandbaby.  That's a BIG deal.  My oldest "baby" is 20, a junior in college, and my Michael is 6.  Every age is special.  Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.  He's in my thoughts, so I appreciate the info.  Kay 
 Hi Bob,  I believe I gave on October 24, so I'll go again around Christmas.  I'm glad that you've gotten some good news, and here's hoping for a much better 2001!  Kay 
 I just don't know how many questions they can come up with.   I've quit predicting.  Kay 
 Rose,  I suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can assign without consent.  As of now commercial operation is not a defined term (I hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a different milestone.  Thanks,  Kay 
 http://www.gruene.net/gruenemansion/  http://www.guadaluperiverranch.com/  I love to look up this stuff...  Kay  PS It was great seeing you guys last week. 
 I was out on vacation last week, so I just now received this.  I'll give it a look.  Kay 
 Hello.  I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.  Thank you,  Kay Mann x57566 
 Hi there,  In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.  In connection with this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning resolution of these matters.  As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.  Your comments would be appreciated.  Kay 
 Do the LM facility agreements for DevCo turbines need to contemplate ENA as an agent?  Will it specifically be ENA, or an ENA subsidiary?  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI.  I hope to have a conversation with GE today regarding finishing this document, including the exhibits.  Kay 
 I've heard that the turbines are supposed to be moved out of WestLB today. The contract with GE is not quite finished, although it is close.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  Is everything ok?  I hope you are just having a nice day to yourself.  What perfect weather!  Kay 
 Hi!  Matt is over until 300, Paige is off with Abbey, and I'm waiting for a conference call to start.  How many places should I set at the table tomorrow?  ckm 
 What a great idea!  Unfortunately, I bought her something already, which is highly unusual for me.  Hope you are enjoying all your guys.  Kay 
 Welcome back!!!!  I was worried about you - tooooo much stress.  Hope you can relax for at least 24 hours.  ckm 
 FYI, Kent Shoemaker (GE lawyer for LM's)  is on vacation today, but I believe he will be back in the office next Monday.  Kay 
 Do you know if we had TECO sign a confidentiality agreement?  Who is the counterparty to the participation agreement?  I thought we were just sending out  the public documents.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The referenced section are primarily names and addresses for invoices and official notices.  I'll pass the other info along.  Thanks,  Kay    Enron Global Finance 
 Good morning.  So did I get moved?  If so, please don't worry about unpacking.  I actually prefer to do it myself anyway.  I'm not checking voice mail, so if anyone calls I'm on vacation.  Period. I've spoken to Sheila and Gregg Penman, and I'm taking care of what they need, but if I take on anything else, I might as well pack Michael up and come to the office today.  Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.  See you Monday!  Kay 
 I like the changes.  I forwarded it to Bill to give him one last shot, but if we don't hear from him by noon, I would go with it. 
 Any problem with this?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Eric,  Has this info been provided to Andrews and Kurth yet?  It is needed to finish the facility agreement for the LM's, especially if you are trying to move these out of the existing contract on Monday.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Looks like the changes are relatively minor, but I feel better! 
 That reminds me that I had trouble reaching the pedals in your Bronco. 
 Peter,  Go ahead and complete the draft with what you have, and transmit it to me with a list of questions which need to be answered to finish it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hey Suz,  I'm off to walk my dog.  I'm doing some stuff for Gregg Penman this am, but it isn't too bad.  Paige will be home in time to go to lunch, and Michael wants her to come visit his school.  Hope all is quiet.  Is Dan OK?  Ciao,  Kay

 Hi there,  I need to get with Lee Johnson on another deal, and I know he will ask about LV CoGen.  Anything I should tell him?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is it reasonable to expect that Enron as well as Peoples will be involved in the preliminary meetings? 
 Hi Dale,  There is another change order #1 which has been signed by ABB but not Enron, relating to the cancellation of a couple of transformers.  I don't think it will be signed until next week.  Can this change order be used as incentive to get ABB to the table on the breakout contract?  I'm sending a copy of this to Kathleen Clark at EECC and Ben Jacoby, just to make sure there aren't any other change orders floating around.  Ciao,  Kay 
 His last day is tomorrow, not Wednesday. 
 Please print and put with other stuff you just printed.  Thanks 
 Please print. 
 Fine by me.  I'm supposed to be on vacation this week, but so far I haven't done a very good job of it! 
 Yes, and I agree. 
 That Paul has a cloud over him.  At least he has time to heal before baseball season.  We are planning on spending Saturday night.  Neil and I will stay at the B & B.  Enjoy this great weather.  I hear more rain is forecast for the weekend - hope they are wrong!  Love,  Kay 
 Peter,  Enron South America has nothing to do with COA.  Enron North America is the assignee.  As for payments, we can state that as of the signing of the agreements, all payments have been made.  Sounds ok to me.  Kay 
 You'll like it.  Do you want to meet by the garage?  Kay 
 Here's a free look at someone else's deal.  I don't know what role Enron has in the deal after sell down.  Kay 
 Eric, these are already in my list that I sent you.  Kay 
 Dan just dumped me, so we can go any where you want.  Do you have a preference?  Kay 
 Hi Peter,  1. I don't think you need to do anything re Enron South America, as Rob Taylor is working on that.  Were you asking about ENA? Delaware, 1400 Smith, Houston, 77002. 2.  I don't know who is preparing all the exhibits, as I'm waiting to hear from GE.  Don't most of the exhibits just need to be copied?  Is the list you gave me of the exhibits which need to be adapted the right place to look? 3. No.  The November payment has been made.  You should get the other info by email from Eric Boyt.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Eric,  here are some questions from Peter, the AK lawyer who is working on the contract. If you can respond by return email, Peter can keep this moving.   1.  Payee and Address for Invoices referenced in Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement  2. Section 6.7.1 Agreement reference [you might see if NEPCO has a reference]  3. For the recitals, what is the kW capacity of its plant and where is the plant located?  4. According to the spreadsheet, the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for Units 9-11 was 10/30/00.  The Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 12 is 11/30/00.  Are these still the dates we are using?  5. Please provide the serial numbers for Units 9-12 for Section 10.2.1.  6. Please provide the names, addresses, etc. for Sections 25.1 and 25.3   Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm packing my office (yes, another move), so I'm generally avialable.  Do you want to come over here around 1130, and we'll load up Dan and go.  This will be a car trip, as FD is on Taft. 
 Does this project have another name?  I'm not familiar with Fountain Valley. Is this the same as PSCO?  Kay 
 Hi,  Got your voice mail, and it reminded me to sent this out.  I don't know what is up with Jeff, so why wait to send this?  Next comes Finance/M&A (Lance and Travis).  I'm having lunch with Dan today - want to join us?  We are going to Fox Diner.  Kay 
 I wanted to pass along the resume of Carlos Sole. Carlos and I worked together extensively at EECC.  The "reorganization" of EECC has him moving to EES, but he would prefer to work here.  He recently met with V. Sharp, and she understands that he wants to explore opportunities at EWS (I'm learning the new nomenclature).  John Schwartzenburg understands this as well.  I can recommend Carlos as a solid, intelligent, hard working lawyer. He's a great guy and I believe he would fit in well here.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Greg/Steve,  Since AEWhite will be out of the office for the next two and a half weeks, I've volunteered for to cover her power development work in Florida.  Just in case you don't have my numbers:  office 713 345 7566  home 713 973 6325 cell 713 314 8716.  As a  heads up, I believe Rose Engeldorf, the Global Finance lawyer who helps us process documents, will be on vacation beginning June 2.  Anything which may need to be blessed can probable be done a bit more easily before Rose leaves.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Dale,  Do you have the missing info?  If not, I can send it to you.  Kay 
 Lee, I'm  in town next week (fishing a lot, though) and can be reached at the office or 713 973 6325.  Kay 
 I tried to figure out how to print the whole thing, but failed.  Did she figure out how to print the entire document?  It really has a lot of information on it.  Kay 
 I just spoke with GE's counsel, and here's where we are:  Change the following for the final draft: 1.80  delete "remaining" 10.2.1  take out the note  Otherwise, GE had no comments.  Peter/Chris,  If you look on the spreadsheet I sent you earlier, it gives the unit numbers for each of the projects.  You can figure out the guaranteed delivery dates by matching up the delivery dates from the contracts with the number.  Also, please fix the use of purchase amount in 10.10.6 as suggested by Dale.  The ESA deal has a change order associated with it (change order 3, attached below) and that CO is not reflected in the amounts to be paid.    City of Austin has no change orders.  The assignee is Enron South America.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Dale,  Looking good so far.  Peter/Paul,  FYI.  Kay 
 Dale said it was ok for me to send this to you.  Kay 
 Per Rose's instructions. 
 200 sounds good to me, and an hour should be sufficient. 
 How do we look for a conference call today?  I'll be open in about an hour.  Kay 
 I haven't heard from GE yet today.  Is your cell phone still the best way to contact you? 
 If Carlos has reviewed it I don't need to comment.  ckm 
 I'm in a conference call marathon, but I'll holler.  You might just want to look at the sections referenced in the memo.  Kay 
 fyi  I'll send you the list of site specific references also. 
 Dale,  What is your availability for a conference call with GE today?  Kay 
 fyi 
 Looks like Lee is still in the loop.  Kay 
 FYI.  I believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout contracts - one for the City of Austin project, and one for the ESA project. I heard yesterday that they want the ESA contract by November 22, and the COA shortly thereafter.  I expect to talk to Kent today about where we are on the form, and how to move forward to closure.  Kay 
 I never would have guessed smoked oysters.  I think I'm cooking for the 4 of us, plus Lena and any stray friends we find.  We will probably come to Palacios on Saturday and spend the night, although I haven't discussed it with Mom yet.  It is dreary here today, but in a nice way.  I don't mind it too much, although by Sunday we may be stir crazy.  We went to Michael's school on Wednesday, as his class was singing in chapel.  Roger Clements was there, video cam in hand, doing the dad thing. He is a really big guy, much bigger than I thought.  He looks like a football player.  I see why Piazza didn't take a swing!  I would say "break a leg" for Katie, but with your groups orthopedic problems, I hesitate to use the phrase!  Love,  Kay 
 Hi John,  Neil and I discussed this last night.  I know we are interested in at least as many games as we had last year.  I'll check with him and get back to you.  Hope all is well.  I haven't forgotten you!  Kay 
 Why would you ask a question out of the blue? 
 Please advise if you think this is ready to go to GE. 
 So? 
 Sounds great to me.  If we need Ben, it will need to be after noon eastern. If it is just us chickens anytime after 930 your time is good for me.  Kay 
 Hi guys,  I thought it would be a good idea to come up with an plan of action to get the facility agreements closed out.  From what I can tell here, the ESA and City of Austin deals are the most time sensitive. 
 Ben,  Has the payment allocation chart been updated, and if so, could I get a copy?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I guess the ESA lawyers have decided that this is not the time to outsource project work!  We are to the point where we need Ben to help pull the technical and financial details together.  I'll see what I can do to get his attention.  Dan is still in the midst of his health issues, so he is fasting in anticipation of a 230 physical.  Roger Balog brought a pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious, and one of clerks made the best collard greens I had ever had.  I am miserable - which means I ate a lot more than greens and a piece of cheese cake.  Kay 
 Maybe it is Lisa Alfaro.  If you prefer that an ENA lawyer handle it, I will volunteer.  Your plate is more full than mine (I just ate at the luncheon, and I'm thinking in food metaphors.)  Kay 
 Please! 
 Are they still available? 
 I left Kent a message, suggesting that we start with COA, telling him ENA is the assignee.  I'll let you know when I hear from him.  Kay 
 I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out contracts.  I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm asking  your help.  I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on immediately.  I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.  Please let me know what you think.  Kay 
 Hi David,  Either email or handwritten works for me.  I would just as soon have everything now, if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow.  In discussing the extension yesterday, the consensus was that we should extend until June 29th.  If the deal gets done sooner, we can always have the new doc supercede the old one.  I'm copying Heather and Reagan so that they can  let me know if I've got it wrong.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You are right on all points (especially the punting one!).  You should have the list of specific "fill in the blank" stuff which I forwarded recently. Also, we had a discussion yesterday with GE on the form of the assignment/assumption agreement, so there shouldn't be anything required of you from that standpoint.  I'm here today (wasn't yesterday) and will be happy to discuss it with you.  Kay 
 I agree. 
 FYI 
 Ross/Jackie,  Here's my list of comments to the most recent draft.  It is subject to internal review, but this gives you an idea.  Could we have a telephone conference to knock out as many of these as possible?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Last time I checked I didn't have a fax from you.  Did it go through? 
 Please print and fax the email and the attachment.  I emailed Jeff and told him what I'm up to today, by the way.  Kay 
 What an awful mess. 
 Ben,  I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.  Hope the kids cut you some slack after your late night.  You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.  It was 65 degress this am.  I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be wonderful in this weather.  Next comes 90 degrees.  Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills assessment to put them on teams.  He loved it. His big sister and her boyfriend took  him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.  He is wearing his shin guards and soccer shorts to school today.  Too cute.  Hope you are enjoying your little ones.  Kay 
 Vizsla.  I think they are also known as Hungarian pointers, but vizsla is the official AKC name. 
 Will Sheila be in the office today? 
 I'll be calling in from out of the office, as will Sheila. 
 I've found CompareRite to work with long documents.  Plus, these documents started out as WordPerfect documents and were converted to Word, which I think creates problems with Word comparisons.  I figure it is a Gates conspiracy...  Kay 
 Yes, such as the side letter, assignments, etc.  That may be about it, but I don't trust my memory.  Since there is so much to do in such a short time, lists help!  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi.  I'm printing.  Kay 
 Here's something to look at.    I'm heading out soon for Master Whalley's birthday party at the Houstonian, but I'll check messages later today.  Kay 
 Paul/Peter,  Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments from the text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version against the original master contract.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Are you going to get a Palm Pilot? 
 I'm leaving now anyway.  ckm 
 Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone.  Here are the issues which need to be addressed to keep things moving:  1. Which transformers go where?  2. How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?  3. ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the contract allows for them to request payment security.  Unless they are convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment security.  The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except retainage) to facilitate the assignment.  Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break out contracts closed. I'm available any time.  Kay 
 fyi 
 okey dokey 
 Gentlemen,  Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I know it is short, but I thrive on lists.  I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues for that document as well.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Hi Don,  I'm not connecting this with anything on my "to do" list.  Were you looking for someone else?  Kay 
 Hey Suz,  Is Sheila still planning on having the GE call tomorrow?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Peter,  Do we have a good clean copy?  If so, please re-send it to me, along with the best of blacklines.  I have so many versions that I want to be clear that we are looking at the same documents.  I also want to send the best of the best to GE, the Enron commercial team and the 4 other Enron lawyers who have received the defective versions.  Thank you,  Kay 
 I'll discuss with Carlos.  ckm 
 My recollection is that I gave it to Sheila around the time it came in, but I wouldn't swear to it.  I'll check around here.  Kay 
 Heather,  I think the clean one is ok to send to Bob Wright as is.  Kay 
 Ok, I'm almost done forwarding emails. 
 FYI. 
 Your suggestion is probably cheaper for Enron! 
 Looks like they have a rats nest to figure out.  ckm 
 A que hora?  (what time?) 
 Need a sitter.  I'm working on it!  Any idea what time it starts?  Kay 
 Hi Heather, Jeff and Ozzie,  The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are "extremely quiet".  At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a facility is to their house.  You may have determined that the noise level will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not reflect the expected noise level.  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 I thought I had sent it out on Friday, but I had just saved it as a draft. Must have been the full moon.  Kay 
 I got lots done Saturday, but I can't remember what!  You know how that goes.  I bought a few Christmas presents, which felt good.  I went to the grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing.  That felt decadent.  We didn't get hit too badly.  Jack ran off during the worst part of the storm, scaring Neil and I horribly.  A  neighbor brought him back.  We are having an electronic fence installed soon, so I hope that will help.  I'm glad Michael got to see Uncle Bob.  He was very impressed that his name was so close to Uncle Bobby's.  I'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week.  Sorry I can't get organized.  Hope you are enjoying better weather today!  Love,  Kay 
 Scott,  Here are letters to Westinghouse, as revised to reflect our comments.    Kay 
 Hi Peter,  When do you  think we will have a pretty compared document?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Not today.  Let's get feedback from GE today.  Plus, the document has a lot of formatting glitches and it looks terrible.  Does that work?  Kay 
 Thanks! 
 Print job.

 Here's the blacklined version.  Kay 
 Blackline to follow.  Kay 
 Peter,  If I can get the clean version, I'm happy to run a blackline here.  Maybe getting out of your system would help!  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Geneva,  The instruction sheet mentions a gift bag.  Do I pick this up at drop off?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Peter,  Do you have a new ETA yet?  I need to manage expectations on this end.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's how it is shaping up:  We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation. Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate open.  We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20 consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it. The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.  If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.  We should be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be home on Tuesday.  Kay 
 Hi John,  Thanks for your call the other day.  The team is currently focused on getting the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.  Also, we have had some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the equipment.  I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.  It may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.  The next big item will be the project development agreement.  The tax credit monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.  Again, thanks for checking  in.  Kay

 1100 is just fine.  We are all so dependent on our computers, I can hardly remember what we did in the "old days".  Kay 
 Hi Stuart,  I believe the plant manager was going to call someone at SW, to keep the communication lines open.  I'll be glad to draft a friendly letter to follow up.  Kay 
 If it says Austin, it must be yours....  Kay 
 Barbara has asked that I submit a weekly report about what I'm working on.  I haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket items:  Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.  Enron owns equity and holds warrants for Fuel Cell stock.  We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the benefit of the warrants.  The commercial team is  working on a deal to place 50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.  I have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently completed the LOI with CRRA.  We need to move to more definitive docs with CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete. The decision about whether the state will fund the project is expected in December.  This deal is likely to continue to take up a large amount of  my time, and requires a fair amount of travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.  This transaction is on Dave D and Janet D's radar screen, and  Mark is familiar with it.  The potential upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.  Turbopark.  Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects. Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.  This requires a series of contracts with GE (at least 6) which I am working on. We also have to move transformers into this facility, so I have been in contact with ABB concerning same.  GE general.  ENA is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with GE. I've been working with Sheila on this one.  We are committed to finish this project by the end of this year.  Westinghouse warranty issues.  ENA has two significant disputes wiht Westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines.  I'm riding herd on resolving the issues.  VEPCO.  We were attempting to negotiate a PPA with Virginia Power, but ran into some problems, so it won't close this year.  Theres' some miscellaneous follow up work to do.  Illinois development.  I'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power plant sites in Illinois.  Enron/Peoples joint venture.  I'm working with the Enron commercial team in certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running.  This gives at least an overview of what I'm spending most of my time on. . 
 We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the break out contract.  We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be close to final as far as the form goes.  I have also asked A & K to prepare a memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the document.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Hi Jeff and Barbara,  I would really like to stay where I am, if possible.  I like being close to Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI,  I expect to be on vacation that week.  Kay 
 Hi Mark,  I thought I was in my "final" office.  Where am I moving?  Kay 
 As I fix I was going to offer to let GE pick up 1/2 their bill....  Kay 
 I can assure you that no improvement in the relative risk allocation was intended.  They pointed out what appeared to be some disconnects, and in some cases I ok'd them putting the suggestions in for discussions purposes.  I wasn't trying to play games.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Scott,  As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access the resources in their group, however.  FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for you to look at.  As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent. Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.  Kay 
 Here's a rough cut.  Let me know what you think.  The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the units.  These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions, noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.  In addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is capable of producing the required output without outages. The final test protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.  Heather:  There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.  If it has been, we could make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.  I'm sure Ric knows.  Kay 
 Here's a rough draft of a different approach to assignment.  Do you think it fits with the possible structures?  Kay 
 I wasn't sure from your email if you wanted to review it now, or wait until Jackie and I sort through some things.  Kay 
 I just opened it.  It came in last night. 
 Jackie,  Would it be possible for you to mark up the list of comments, highlighting which are outstanding?  Marked by hand and faxed would be great.  Thanks,  Kay 
 As usual, the lawyers are the last to know.  Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days. Please review the attached and give me a call.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please call Paul Pipitone (Houston) and Peter Thompson (he's in DC) and ask them to call in at 130. I'm not sure Paul will be joining us, but Peter has confirmed.  If we are delayed we'll let them know.  How long did you reserved the line?  I can see the call going until 330.  Kay 
 I know the feeling. 
 Due to the sensitivity of the information, we'll be specific.  Also, should this be addressed to Bill or Curtis, or someone else?  Kay 
 De nada. 
 This is the most recent thing I have from GE specifically on LOL and indemnity. Our memories appear to be correct this time, unless I'm missing something from my file.  Kay 
 I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.  This week I stayed at 52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison. Madison is close to 5th.  I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.  The weather is beautiful here.  Hope it lasts a couple of days.  Neil loves his pig.  I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.  Have a great day!  Love,  Kay 
 Oh well.  Jeff is in London, but will be here on Monday.  Kay 
 Hi Guys,  We don't expect to deal with the facility agreement until around 130, so there isn't a need for Lee to listen to the rest unless he wants to.  Lee, you are more than welcome to come in person, in which case I can give you some exectued change orders.  Kay 
 I thrive on pressure.  My birthday is January 11th.  Is that close to her due date?  Kay 
 Jeff,  I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume along.  I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly. He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied transactional background.  As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.  EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to ENA (or EA, whatever we are called). He discussed this with Vicky, so she is aware that he is checking out opportunities here.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Ben,  As a retired trial lawyer, I prefer saying less whether than more. I'll bring the letters down and we can discuss specifics. 
 Attached are two letter our commercial lead on the salt soaked unti wants to send.  Kay 
 Any practice area preference?  ckm 
 Another for the book.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print the black line and put with the binder you are building. 
 As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet impact. 
 This look ok?  It will be presented to Dave Duran to execute Monday am unless you suggest otherwise.  Kay 
 Here's the agreement I would like to get in front of Mike.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Could you please print this, and put in a big binder?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm HERE!!!  How about the reorg?  Mark H looks like he came out great.  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her. do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.  On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.  Ta ta for now,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  Was there a PUHCA analysis done?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I'll check around here to see what I can find out, but I thought I'd ask you if you know the answer. I'll also check with B& P.  Is Sarah off of this?  I hope I didn't open a can of worms.  Kay 
 Joel,  I didn't work on the deal, so I'll have to check around the Legal Dept.  Kay 
 Lou,  Did someone do a PUHCA analysis in connection with the Peoples/Enron LLC formation?  Kay 
 fyi 
 Ross,  The only thought I have with respect to this request would be that it should not apply if FCEL has failed to comply with its warranty obligations, or has declined to service the modules after the warranty period has expired.  Kay 
 Remarketing. 
 Here's a redraft of one letter, second to follow: 
 She's making them now. The trip just came up 30 minutes ago. 
 I don't have it. 
 Latest version. 
 Please call him. 
 Please print the attached on letterhead.  I'm leaving for Connecticut shortly, and will be back in the office on Thursday (or so I exepct).  Please handle the following  Call David Runnels at A & K and tell him thanks, but I can't use the opera tickets this weekend.  Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Suz,  Please print two originals of this CA (in my CA directory) InterGen North America CA May 18 rev 1.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Kathleen, Please change the first paragraph as follows: ENA is prepared to furnish you with certain risk analysis information which= =20 is either confidential, proprietary or generally not available to the publi= c=20 ("Confidential Information") in connection with ENA=01,s disclosure to PERC= =20 and/or enovate for its performing independent risk analysis relating to of= =20 the portfolio of enovate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company.

Gregg also needs a resoluting regarding signing authority, but I've left hi= m=20 a voice mail asking for more information. Thanks,  Kay 
 This doesn't have the latest from what you sent. 
 I'm just about half done with the chart, so I thought I would share it with you for comment. 
 Sheila,  I should have sent this to you as well.  Kay 
 Joel,  Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.  As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as possible.  If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.  Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate most of their legal issues now.  I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal.  When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!  We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll probably figure things out in the next few days.  We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans. I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.  Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way today.  Love,  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  FYI.  Kay 
 I like your letter. 
 Scott,  I ran a redline comparing the version we sent last Thursday and their new clean draft.  It shows a different number of changes.  Here's the Enron redline:    Too much paper!  Kay 
 When I run a CompareRite redline I get a different number of changes, so I was unclear as to the compared documents.  Kay 
 Please confirm the version of the document which was the basis of the compared version.  Thank you,  Kay 
 I got a draft of the CA from her this am.  I'll give it a look and get it to you today.  ckm 
 Gregg,  Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.  Since Corp will be loaning the money, I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, so to speak).  Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate is priceless.  Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...  Strange choice for a company name!!!  Kay 
 Hi Kent,  I believe this to be blacklined against the original document.  Please note there are some comments/questions included.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Please print this monster.  Kay 
 As requested, I went the abbreviated route.    Kay 
 Tell him he is dropping to the B list.  It was sent via fax to her.  Kay 
 I'll send the blackline when I get it.  Kay 
 Hi Jordan,  I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.  Peoples and Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.  Each of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.  It is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah Wesner has been involved in the process.  Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to run this transaction through your group for blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.  I can give additional information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I could nap in this weather.  Maybe I'll leave early. 
 I asked Paige what she was doing for Thanksgiving.... 
 I think it is a great day to work! 
 I just completed a lengthy call with A & K concerning the form facility agreement.  A revised draft should be out mid-day today.  I have once again called ABB, but haven't heard back from them yet.  Kay 
 I accept the terms & conditions of this Pilot Participation Agreement.  Kay Mann 
 I would like to attend.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Off the internet:   FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free. "The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades," said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. "This application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions." According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion market. "The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in benefits for all concerned," said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of FuelCell Energy. "Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users." Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. "This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment", said Walt Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center. "We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems." "In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells," said Leitman. Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process.

 Greetings,  Ok, I know I must be doing something wrong.  I either get a "wrong SAP number", or I end up on the HRonline website, with no Clickathomepilot options.  I'm using my HRonline password.  Any suggestions?  Thanks,  Kay 
 You have to admire the initiative!  Suzanne is adding your changes to the purchase agreement now.  Kay 
 I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good. 
 Kent,  There isn't anything attached that I can open.  Am I doing something wrong?  Kay 
 The word Suzanne heard is that they are moving everyone to the Enron Corp book in the somewhat near future.  They moved me there from EI when I transferred last March.  Kay 
 Hi there.  Hope all is well.

 Please tell Paul it will probaby be 315 or so before we call, and confirm the correct number. Also, please let Lisa Bills know where we will be meeting, as she is planning on coming late to the meeting.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I need to do the unthinkable and read something else for a little while, so I thought I would send this to you as is.  Let me know if you want it redlined against something, and if so, which version.  Kay
