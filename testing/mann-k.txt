m.  I'm sorry,  I don't recall you telling me that the original membership=20 certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday. However, we will be able t= o=20 handle this.=20  This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off  closing= =20 list by mid-day Friday.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll check.  I remember signing the faxes and signing the originals, but not the return.  However, last week was the WEEK FROM HELL, so I easily could have missed it.  Kay 
 Perfectly. thanks 
 Hi John,  It would probably be better for me if we could reschedule, since I will be out of town Wed-Mon.  Rain check?  Kay 
 I suspect they are accustomed to people wanting to structure for an MTM deal from a commercial standpoint.  Doesn't sound like our objective here.  ckm 
 I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow, bu= t=20 Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready unt= il=20 Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would=20 appreciate it if you could confirm.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  Lee Johnson is asking about the break out contract for LV Co Genn and when it will be ready. I need to return his phone call, especially since I need one more deliverable to be able to close the Delta transaction.   What should I tell him?  Kay 
 No news today.  I don't want to know today, as I'm drinking champagne and ignoring the issue, 
 Neil,  I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets nothing at school.  She has no independent information on the rest and shouldn't worry about providing that info to them. 
 This is really just an excuse to write - did you give me the executed pages?  Thanks,  ckm

It is a bit cumbersome, but I think I like it.  What do you think?  I'll forward the entire doc soon.  Kay 
 I did, and it is fine.  Kay 
 Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient. =20  I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is n= ot=20 enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the Portland= =20 team wants to sign the documents.=20  Kay 
 The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.= =20 Does it have to be an original?  Kay 
 I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.  I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.  Kay 
 Need exhibit B added.  Redlines are against most recent version sent by Reagan. 
 For future reference on the long term deal.  Kay 
 No. 
 No, he thinks he is God's gift to contracts. 
 Kay 
 I have a closing scheduled for Wednesday, so I don't know when I'll be getting to San Antonio.  Better leave me off the list.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think we are supposed to do this tomorrow (Monday).  Kay 
 Consistent with my discussions with Reagan, I have revised the body of the interim agreement.    Some of the exhibit references will need to be cleaned up once we know where we are headed.  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  As far as I know, we are still on board for closing on Wednesday.  Kay 
 Here are the issues I see with their draft:  Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full contract in place.  Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel oil.  Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.  Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.  Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the market. 
 This shows changes as if they were revising the doc that we generated on Friday. 
 Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.  I'll check into it for the  longer term deal.  Obviously, it is a Mississippi law issue, so I'll have to get an opinion.  Kay 
 Terrific.  Have a great weekend!  Kay 
 Figures. 
 I think there's lots which will need to be fixed.  I can't fix it now, though.  Here's where I am on the ILA.  I think it should be distributed internally and to the Cities ASAP,  with an explanation that we are still pondering it.  Kay    PS.  I didn't redline because there were formatting challenges I couldn't figure out.  Kay 
 Many thanks.  Pardon my ignorance, but is there a list of riders to select from? The transaction that we are contemplating is with a municipality, so we need some muny language if such thing exists.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think you can send it just so he has the form, and we can figure out what we need to do with it.  Kay 
 Fine by me. 
 Starting point for exhibit 2 
 I may make the tour through the going aways, esp Oz.  I called the spa to make appts, but got voice mail.  Love,  Kay 
 the first couple of pages sort of explains whose on first. 
 Glad you made it safely!  I have a new home email address kay.mann@worldnet.att.net  Have a nice afternoon, and enjoy the cool mornings while they last.  Love,  Kay 
 Lee johnson just called to see when he can sign the agreement.  I told him I would ask you guys.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Awaiting test results.  You know how that goes.  I give you details later.  I may go; I'll let you know. 
 I thought I did help.  I'm lost. 
 thanx 
 I made some comments/revisions.  I'm  not sure I understand the profit/savings, but I didn't take the time to contemplate it. 
 fyi  Carlos is working on it. 
 You may have seen one of these before... 
 This is the counterparties' first draft of the one month agreement.  Kay 
 By the way, they have seen the turbine contract. 
 fyi.  We are hoping to get together at 900 to continue to work on our interim gameplan.  I don't know the location yet.  Kay 
 I would think that Dale would have the legal lead, since he is the project's lawyer.  Lisa Bills, Roseann Engeldorf and Catherine Clark are the people I send TurboPark stuff to.  Kay 
 This change really helps me with babysitter problems.  Thanks,  Kay 
 yes  Cant miss those boxes! 
 Thanks thanks thanks 
 This is none of my business, but the turbines are owned by ENext.  Hows does the LLC give the assignment?  Should the turbine contract be in the name of the LLC, because it isn't at this moment.  Maybe I messed up.  Kay 
 Don't forget that Global Finance is supposed to review these.  They have the turbine contract. 
 FYI, Dale has the lead on this one.  Thanks,  Kay 
 YIPPEEE.  I'm about to fall face down in my computer.  I'm not as young as I used to be.  Kay 
 Bill, I don't have any information about the ABB contract.  At last word, Lee Johnson was reviewing the latest version of the GE contract that Pete Thompson had sent out.  Kay 
 John,  Just wanted you to be aware.  No action required - water under the bridge.  Kay 
 Fed ref now available. 
 Salmon Energy. 
 Hi Guys,  Delta has asked when the LOC can be issued for the final payment.  We have every expectation that payment will be made on May 2nd, and we will know for sure by later today.  Would it be possible to have the LOC by Tuesday?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Billy,  It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it could be immediately prior to that time.  Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed this agreement before she left.   Kay 
 Hi Estelle,  Have you or Barbara sent the email etc out re establishment of the account? We are on a conference call now re funding.  Thanks for your help,  Kay 
 Can you tell me to whom we send the originals?  Kay 
 Didn't go through the first time.  Kay 
 hey, good questions.  I'll check.  ckm 
 Just tell me the end is in sight. 
 The fun never ends. 
 Gentlemen,  These docs are ready to go, and your signatures would be appreciated.  I will initial the docs when Steve delivers them to me tomorrow.  Kay 
 CC,  I would really like to have a  signed off closing list and final forms of all docs by mid-day Friday.  If something happens and I either can't be on the call or forget to bring this up, please mention it.  Thanks,  kay 
 I'm scheduled to be in a meeting tomorrow am, but I know this deal is in good hands.  Page me if anything exciting happens.  I'm fine with the assignment agreement version PH sent out this afternoon. I'm sure MK has the punctuation just right.  Kay 
 I received a fax in yesterday, so I'll review it.  Kay 
 Your esteemed colleague suggested I send this to you for your review.  Kay 
 We need the Assignment and Assumption and Bill of Sale signed.  Kay 
 Re:  my voice mail concerning masters.  ckm 
 I may need your help.  Kay 
 When sending out the assignment and assumption agreement, are we sending originals to all four people listed in the second paragraph?  Do you remember how many originals are required?  Thanks,  Kay 
 832 651 3478 is what I have 
 Is this ready to go as far as your concerned?  Kay 
 Kent,  This forms supposedly integrated the requested changes you saw previously. Would love to have this by Friday.  I'll forward the opinion letter in just a sec.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Amazing that they stayed afloat.  50 year history probably helped that happen.  Kinda sad, though.  I liked those guys. 
 fyi.  Did you get word that the Delta deal is going into escrow tomorrow, closing on May 2nd?  Kay 
 I authorized the wire to be sent to set up the account.  Progress! 
 Hi there,  We plan to sign on the dotted line with NorthWestern today.  MKahn (who works through lunch, don't you know) is turning the final draft of the letter agreement.  Kay 
 Carolyn,  I faxed signed sig pages for the ENA letter, ENA consent, resolution authorizing transaction, GE letter as to forms, escrow agreement, cert of incumbancy for escrow, fee agreement.  I faxed the docs to the 80 fax number.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please delete Michael Miller.  It would be helpful if I don't have to get the certificate today, as that entails signatures of folks in two locations. Isabel didn't have it on her list.  It is also helpful if the certificate is signed by Duran or Calger.  Kathleen, is Chris Calger an MD or VP?  Thanks,  Kay

 Redline of revised assignment and assumption agreement.     Kay 
 Per my previous email.  NW doesn't have this change. 
 fyi. =20 
 fyi 
 YIPPEEE 
 Might close on the letter agreement today.  You didn't miss much - mostly negotiations with GE re: change orders. Our tax guys are happy, and Accounting is hanging in there.  We have revised the payment schedule in the doc, but NW doesn't have the change.  I'll send it to you.  The change is minor.  I need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement, then we'll be ready to go when GE signs up to the CO's.  Kay 
 I have the executed signature pages and the certificate of incumbancy.  I'm going to print today's other ENA deliverables and fax to Jake for signature after I initial.  Kay 
 for your review and approval.  I have your signature on this one. 
 It is our responsibility to pay the fees, which I hope will need to be paid today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 As I understand it, if the escrow is funded tomorrow morning, the earliest closing date would be May 2nd.  Kay 
 I haven't seen the escrow disbursement letter lately.  Is it circulating?  Kay 
 It would appear to me that the closing of the Salmon equity sale will not occur until May something or other, so that the documents which are deliverables at closing should have May something or other dates, and not April.  Anyone see it any differently?  Kay 
 I should have sent this to you.  Sorry.  Might save time if you got financials from Mike re: NorthWestern Corp.  Kay 
 Hey, I thought you were out.   I hope you noted that I was watching out for you. 
 Looks to me like they aren't ready to close their financing.  Hope I'm wrong. 
 Isabel,  Who is the "intial purchaser", and why are the documents dated tomorrow?  Thanks again,  Kay 
 Did Kent review the changes to (h) of the consent agreement (re jurisdiction)?  Kay 
 Isabel,  Unless I'm missing something, two of these documents are the same (93), and we are missing the no objections to forms letter.  Kay 
 I guess we know now that they weren't waiting on us, since they hadn't finished the GE docs.  Kay 
 Warren,  The other party changed all those docs I asked you to print (not the ones in the book, the ones for the folders), so you can skip that one.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Have a good trip. 
 Isabel,  Please confirm before 830 central this morning (when GE's rep will be in my office to sign docs) that these documents have final approval of GE's counsel, as I believe Kent is not available to review documents today. Obviously, I cannot present revised documents to a commercial representative of GE without knowing that his lawyer has signed off on the documents, except to the extent that the changes are obviously minor.   Kay 
 Looks good to me. 
 It is Paige's 21st today (YIKES)  I'll be back Monday 
 Please print two copies.  On the stuff you had copied for me, please have the copy sent to John Keffer at King & Spalding.  I'll keep the originals.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Attached is a redline version of the turbine contract, showing changes from the previous form.    Kay 
 Latest draft of turbine contract for LV Co Gen.  ckm 
 I count small wins! 
 Hi Warren,  FYI.  ckm 
 It looks good to me.  Am I missing something? 
 Is this the right account for Pegasus to send the money to?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Has GE signed off on the numbers?  Kay 
 Ben,  In speaking with Herman, he suggested that you look at the earnings on Blue Dog on the hot list.  It is showing a total $10.5 (4 East, 4 West in q2, 2.5 in q3 (East).  ckm 
 Hi Warren,  Please print all of these documents, and place in individual file folders with the name of the document.  I will need 6 copies of each of the signature pages for each of the documents.  If it is easier you can just make 6 copies of each document.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Jerry,  Would you mind re-sending?  I can't find it on my system anywhere.  I did find the signature page sent 4/20.  Many thanks,  Kay 
 Yes,which is what prompted my email this am. I'm looking for a way to simplify the process since closing is less than a week away.  I'm in 825-925; 1000-1230 today.  Kay 
 Ed is the only one I've heard from today.  I've forwarded his questions to our local counsel in Mississippi for their input insofar as the questions involve capacity to contract.  You'll be pleased to know that I understood his questions.  I'm so proud.  Kay 
 Hi Theresa,  I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.  He suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the escrow fee of $10,500.  Please let me know what other info you need to tee this up.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Jerry,  Do we have a final, execution version of the letter agreement?  I understand that Enron's tax folks are ok with the suggested changes to the LLC agreement.  We are working with GE to get the change orders executed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Missing you.... 
 Lined against 3 sounds good.  Circulate to me, Bill, Dale, Lee, Kent Shoemaker.  Kay 
 Sounds good to me, although we are likely to find different purchasers want other stuff as well.  Kinda like on the turbine stuff - each counterparty has wanted something different.  ckm 
 Ok, I give up.  What's an estoppel letter? 
 GE has agreed to the requested changes to the parent guaranty.  Kay 
 Questions re Northwestern from one of the Enron execs.  Kay 
 I double checked and ENext/Wilmington Trust will not be executing the contract. 
 Got it 
 fyi 
 Nope.  Christi Nicolay (a lawyer in the Reg Affairs) is the authority on interconnection as far as I'm concerned.  Kay 
 you bet 
 I forgot about Grandma.  I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR).  Hamburgers sound good to me.  I think MAM does ok in the morning, he just needs his hours of sleep.  Paige was worse to get up. 
 This week, if possible.  As always, the sooner, the better. 
 I sent this yesterday before 5 to find out what you were planning to do re Michael, the game, etc. 
 Hi Ed,  This transaction should close within the next 5-7 days.  Will the original minute books be ready?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  Any progress with the escrow agreement and any other outstanding items? Kathleen Carnahan has the original certificate of incumbancy ready to go.  I would like to get organized for signing docs today, GE, Enron and Delta. Could you email me the execution forms of the docs which need to be signed by GE and Enron (except the turbine contract)?  Hard copies are fine, I just figure electronic will be easier.  I had conversations with GE re turbine contract, and I expect it will be finished up this am.  Thanks,  Kay 
 We hope to have it executed today or tomorrow.  Kay 
 It is Father's Day and we will do what you want. If you want to go there, that's great.  I'm happy to tell Tom, his wife and all the world that what we do that weekend is 100% up to you.  It sounds like he has the impression that I'm the hold up.  Kay 
 Hi there.  This is the letter Hancock is willing to give us in exchange for Hancock getting a security interest in the escrow account. Any comments?  Kay 
 Pete,  Finance has requested these changes:  Notices to ENA as agent for E-Next.  Signature block should be for E-Next Generation, acting through its agent, Enron North America.  E Next will not be signing, as ENA will sign on its behalf.  Or, ENA, as agent for...  Thanks,  Kay 
 20 pounds!!!!!!!!  Sounds like you to need to buy yourself some new clothes. 
 I am not quite a wreck, and no promotion or raise.  I'll be at the Lake Austin Spa weekend after next, so that keeps me going.  ckm 
 Hope you have a good book to read. 
 You are working too hard. 
 We have requested changes at NorthWestern's request.  Please advise if there are any problems.  Kay 
 Hi Warren,  Please print these and set me up a binder called NIMO May 2001 Bid.  Please index the documents.  It would make sense for the documents to be in the same order as they are on the email.  Thank you.  Kay 
 Very impressive.  We don't have to read these, do we? 
 Please advise which comments you are willing to accept (skipping the nits and legal stuff).  One response from the group, please!  Kay 
 Lee,  I'm reading your email to say that their requested changes are fine by you. Please let me know if I'm wrong.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 hee hee hee 
 You got it.  I asked Carlos if he still speaks espanol.  You should have seen his face.  He looked like he had swallowed a bug.  ckm 
 Needless to say I had a pretty good idea of the location of the bottleneck. Otherwise, I would have called you.  Peggy Banczak quit.  She told me herself, so it must be true.  ckm 
 Please confirm that the changes to change order #2 reflect NW's request.  Thanks,  Kay 
 In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.  I seem to recall that Sheila had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA Development stuff.   I could be off track, but that's how I remember it. There's probably someone with a better memory.  Thoughts?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  Is the LV Co Gen break out contract ready to go?  Lee Johnson was asking this am.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I hope this is the last thing.  Here's the latest version of the contract sans these insertions. 
 Ben,  If Christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement, I ususally don't have outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason. She's the queen of interconnects.  I suppose that after I review it, next stop is Finance/Accounting.  Carlos has given me a couple of comments.  Kay 
 Maybe next time.  I understand that you are just back from holiday, so obviously this comes at a bad time.  See you in SA.  Kay 
 Hi Jerry,  It  would be helpful if the tax point person for NorthWestern could contact Rhett Jackson with Enron. Rhett's number is 713 853-4718.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Didn't I mark his up all ready? 
 Michael Brown,  Do you have the standard offer service agreement?  It isn't in Stuart's file, and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the PPSA.  We need to see how these two agreements fit together.  Has NIMO given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules? We especially need to see the ones that they can assign to Enron (PSEG and NRG).  Given the size of the transaction I think we should have Klauberg (or another New York lawyer) take a look at it. It is an interesting deal.  Kay 
 Hi Warren,  Hope you had a nice weekend.  My weekend went too quickly.  Could you please print this email and the attachments for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Nope.  Carlos Sole (one of our lawyers) took the forms I gave him and fit it to this deal.  I do think the banks' lawyers weighed in.  Kay 
 I didn't know if the seat or the feet give out first. 
 nuttin from nobody  Congrats on the ride.  Are you standing up at your desk today? 
 How much involvement has A & K had on Midway?  I have other counsel engaged for the sale, but this falls into a different category.  Kay 
 Looks like they have re-surfaced.  Kay 
 I was kinda hoping you would fill in the blanks. 
 okey dokey.  Aren't  you on holiday? 
 Do you have enovate agreement handy? 
 Gracias.  Can you see the mountains today?  Later,  Kay 
 monday test 
 I'm thinking we are short lawyers.  Hope that means good things for the survivors! 
 1st group evalutes promotions to VP. =20  Ben is on the analyst PRC. 
 I wanted to review where I think we are in this transaction.  1. Escrow account. We are still awaiting  closure on the issue of the lender's security interest in the escrow account.  A proposal was discussed with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta had defaulted under their loan arrangement.  Indications were that this approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the agreement.  2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.  3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts.  4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we aren't involved in.  I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.  Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.  Kay 
 jhodge@enron.com  I checked his business cards on his desk.  He's left for the day to pick up a car at the shop, so don't be offended if you don't hear from him immediately.  Kay 
 For something that doesn't matter, it seems to matter.  I wonder how well the auto approval works when you are backdating something? 
 Hi Clark,  Could you fill out this chart for us with names and contact info for the Bracewell person (or people) you think would fit the bill the best?  We had a list previously, but I believe some of the folks on it have moved on.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Well, aren't you the quick one.  Jeff is a terrific guy, well-respected in the legal department and on the commercial side.  Kay 
 Attached is the King & Spalding power transaction deal team.  I'll update the information I have for A &K and B &P, since some of the designated lawyers on their lists are no longer there.  Kay 
 I told Jeff Hodge that you were putting him on the list for baseball tickets.  Guess the pressure is on now.  ckm 
 I decided to go a different route.  What do you think?  Kay 
 Please add this to the defn of confidential information:  Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, business strategies, transaction structures, pricing formulae, and other business methods.  We will call it the "Michael Brown burn me twice shame on me" clause.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Hi Jim,  We haven't worked with a term sheet on the equipment sales I've worked on.  Good luck,  Kay 
 opps.  I just opened this. 
 I'm available any time Monday morning.  The sooner (after 830), the better.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals. Kathleen would know. 
 I have my CA expert (Kathleen Carnahan) is working on it now.  Kay 
 Any other rumors? 
 3 nights out in a row would be a bit much for this ol girl. 
 It wouldn't be the same without you! 
 Yet one more round. 
 Thanks for the offer (and the call) but I haven't been able to secure a sitter for Michael.  My schedule should be getting better (famous last words), and I hope we can get together soon.  I would like to introduce you to Carlos Sole, if you haven't met him yet.  Thanks again,  Kay 
 Can you help me with these?  I need to get them fixed up today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print and review to let me know if there is anything stupid in these.  Kay 
 Guess we might want to lob this one in to Delta, just for fun.  Kay 
 Hi there,  Here's the assignment and assumption agreement with the GE consent included. Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks,  Kay     PS.  In discussing the mechanism to move the turbines, it seemed that it would work ok to assign the turbines out of the AIP.  I can't find a flaw with that approach. 
 Could you email me the final form of the assignment/assumption (not compared).  Thanks,  Kay 
 looks good to me. 
 Any comments?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Oh why not.  You probably need to get an overview of the entire deal, as you may want some outside help.  If we are building a plant and selling power, there are lots of folks at Enron who weigh in on it.  Kay 
 Carolyn,  I prefer that closing event #4 preceed #3.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.  I believe the last draft was around the beginning of April.  I can check for more specifics.  Kay 
 Keneally's,   We'll be there by 630. 
 I'm available for one hour, so long as I can call in from off campus.  I'll need a new cell phone battery first!  My old one finally died a tragic death.  Kay 
 Thanks, Cindy.  I haven't given up hope yet!  Kay 
 Any recruits?  Kay 
 Gee, one more item for your review.  Kay 
 Lisa Mellencamp used to have a list of local counsel.  Kay 
 Good idea.  I wouldn't mind something that says that funding of the escrow = is=20 tantamount to closing of the financing under the letter agreement, so that= =20 the financing condition is satisfied.  Something to that effect.  It will= =20 calm Jake down considerably.  Kay 
 I think she will have a great time.  The moms and dads are very friendly. She'll probably know some of them! 
 I'm not betting the farm on the escrow funding tomorrow.  I'll manage=20 expectations on this end.  I don't want to let up on Delta, however. 
 She called me, too. 
 Is there anything we need to get them to consent to?  Kay 
 Sometimes John forgets that he is not a lawyer. 
 Hi Steve,  We need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from escrow.  It should be an  account where money goes in and out in one day. Can you track down the info?  We are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will close once we deliver our deliverables.  Stay tuned!  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  Here are some points which require commercial et al input:  Do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit?  We will be buying electricity to serve their load.  How should be be paid for those costs?  How often?  Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil.  What do you want to do?  I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs.  How should it be used in the agreement?  Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment to the equipment  listed in the exhibit?  What financial security will be required of them?  Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing a time line?  How do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area?  Are we absorbing it?  Will there be additional infrastructure costs?  Have the exhibits been updated?  If so, could I get the latest version?  Kay 
 re: my prior email.  When you print these, please attach the email to the attachment (hard copy).  thanks 
 here's a second email. Another to come. 
 Hi Warren,  I'm going to forward a couple of emails relating to the Delta transaction. Please print and set up like you did the Northwestern stuff.  Thanks,  Kay  PS  I'm on a long conference call, but feel free to walk in. 
 yes. 
 You made a comment on page 13.  It says "(c) purchase of  power ...."  I think this is one of your comments.  What does it mean?  I'm on a conference call, so an email response would be appreciated.  ckm 
 Hi Lee,  Just wanted to check to see if you will be around tomorrow.  I'm trying to get things lined up on multiple fronts, and all roads lead to you.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I haven't read this yet, so it is not ready to be sent to TECO.  Just wanted to give you a look as soon as possible.  Kay 
 So now I know why Sheila had a lock installed on her door. 
 Where do you want this to go?  Someone (I think Dave) asked that this be added:  Each day EPMI shall provide EPMI's Native Load projection, and gas and power projection.  Would it be a projection of  MDEA's Native Load?  Are we providing it or is MDEA?  By what time is the  made  and is it made 365 days a year? 
 what are you talking about?  Are you going to be a GRANNY??? 
 Check.  Kay 
 Ever get the POR info? 
 You asked for the exhibits.  Kay 
 No comment. 
 Can you sneak me a copy of the latest draft? Maybe I can negotiate with Ben.  Kay 
 Next time you vote for me, please copy me on the email.  Kay 
 Congratulations on your new adventure.  I'll miss having you as a neighbor and a colleague.  Kay 
 Please print and put in folder "Northwestern documents 4/19".  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Rose,  I hate to be a pain, but we are trying to sign up Northwestern this week, and the last thing we have to do is the assignment and assumption agreement.  Any break in the log jam with McKay?  Kay 
 Hi Reagan,  Have you revised the exhibits to clarify the scope of scheduling services?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Isabel,  I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.  The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent, and remain unchanged.  Please let me know if you don't have the earlier versions.  Kay 
 Please give Marissa this info.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks,  Kay 
 David Duran can sign the certificate.  Can he certify his own name?  If so, we want him to also be a signatory.  Authorized signers should be Dave Duran (managing director),  Michael J Miller (vice president) and Kevin Presto (vice president).  Kathleen, please verify the way these guys like to sign their names, and current titles.  Let me know if you think we should use someone else.  Chris, we need a name and a call back number for whoever will be watching for the wires.  They will be a call back person. Other call backs are me (using cell phone 713 3047816), Ben Jacoby (415 265 8365).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  Here's another deal like CA Development. We'll be doing the certificate of incumb. today, I think.  Kay 
 fyi 
 I can't make the call on Thursday.  I'm not sure that Sheila can either. I'll leave the go/no go Enron vote to Sheila.  Kay 
 Hi Ed,  Here's a certificate of incumbancy we need to Jake's Delta deal.  Can you handle signature?  We can work with a fax today, but will need a fully executed original for the bank.  Jake, we put a couple of Houston guys just in case something comes up.  We have assumed that you will be executing the docs.  If there's any problem with the list, please let me know.  We need this document to set up the escrow account today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I guess I'd better cancel.  Thanks for the reminder.  Kay 
 I may go home and work after I take Michael.  I'll call. 
 I missed you and your wiseass comments.  Glad you're back. 
 I just called Ben.  He had mentioned the Four Seasons yesterday.  I'm waiting for him to call me back.  Kay 
 Hi there,  Have you had a chance to look at this yet?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Or the lien. 
 Nope.  Only the new ones. 
 Is this ok? 
 Opps.  I hear I should have sent this to you.  This is one of Jake's deals.  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  Have we seen the security agreement yet?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Warren,  Could you please print these for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll look at Michael's CA and Sr. Sole' will take care of the native Americans. 
 For those who don't think we are balance sheet sensitive... 
 FYI. I'm reviewing. 
 Hi Carolyn,  Could I get a updated closing list?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Matt,  Carlos gave me a file folder with the Salmon filing docs.  I need the corp books with share certs, as we are selling the member interests and expect to do so with share certificates.  I need it by Friday if at all possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good timing.  You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added to the "employee/consultant" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless conference call, but I can work while I talk.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gold Rose today? 
 Payment Schedule. Payment Date	Payment Amount April 30, 2001	$50,234,000   TOTAL	$50,234,000  Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any and all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date. The final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.  Also, Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to site conditions.  I added language to Exhibit A-1.  Both of these edits are from the CA form.  Kay 
 Good.  I don't know that a going away party for someone leaving for Mo Money is a morale booster.  Got another head hunter call.  Market must be picking up.  ckm 
 Hi Chris,  We need to coordinate the setting up of an escrow account with Treasury.  We will use Citibank. I believe either Rebecca and/or Kathleen worked on this on the Intergen deal.  Can you help?  Also, do you have an address for the location of turbine 1?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please tell me that this isn't the morale booster.  Kay 
 Please confirm that the signing of the amended LLC agreements will effectively remove the current Enron officers and directors.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I can't remember. 
 I had a vegetarian sandwich. 
 Here's the suck up list. 
 Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a corporate seal.  What BS!  Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.  Kay 
 Accounting and Finance tell me that wiring GE directly from escrow is ok.  Kay 
 Carlos Sole will be working on it, so I'll let him answer the timing issue.  Kay 
 I don't know.  I hate to spring it on her.  Maybe suggest it for next week at the Houstonian. 
 Hi Carolyn,  What does Enron need to do to get the escrow account set up?  Is there something Steve needs to do?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Matt and Ed,  I need the corp docs for Salmon Energy.  Do one of you gentlemen have this? We are getting close to closing.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Taffy,  Did the Pompano Beach meeting get scheduled?  Kay 
 Old Katy Road. 
 I suspect that Chris Calger will be signing the certificate instead of Janet Dietrich.  Please use my cell phone (713 304 8716). 
 This is the rock gym party.  I bought presents for this and the Houstonian party, which is next Wednesday.  Kay 
 I say go ahead with the call to work through any nits etc.  We will need a follow up call anyway, once we know what to do to meet the accting objectives.  This means you won't be available at 200 to talk with the accts, but that's ok.  Finalizing the extension sounds good to me.  Kay 
 Thanks for the info.  Rest well. 
 Ben is ok with the extension.  Ben and I have a meeting with the accountants at 200 (just got scheduled - got to take the apptment when we can).  I'm happy for you guys to go forward with the call. Ben and I will join later if we finish in time.  Kay 
 FYI. 
 Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.  Kay Mann 
 Ben wants to know if you, Marissa and Carolyn are available for lunch tomorrow at 1130.  How does it sound to you?  Kay 
 fyi. 
 I heard a rumor that there is a new leader for EEOS.  True?  Kay 
 How does this look to you? 
 I go back for more tests this afternoon. 
 Hi there.  We need to discuss the Federal Power Act and checking the box.  Kay 
 We expect Delta to fund escrow this Friday.  I will be suggesting to Delta that we close on April 27.  Any insurmountable problems?  Kay 
 Taffy,  please let Ann Elizabeth know that we will reschedule the meeting.  Kay 
 So far so good. 
 Thanks.  I'll prepare Ben.  Kay 
 Hi there,  I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't called me back today to confirm.  Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than a few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Carolyn will send out dial in instructions. 
 I wouldn't worry about the call.  We are just collecting to do lists.  I'm thinking a half hour.  Kay 
 100 pm 
 That would be great.  Thanks.  Kay 
 Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email?  I'm on endless conference calls and need to contact him about a matter.  Thanks,  Kay  PS, not a vacation day 
 Very good.  I was in Miss yesterday and have a doctor's appt this am.  I'll call later.  Kay 
 Hi there,  I suggest a brief status call tomorrow at 100 central to assess where we are and what we need to finish.  How does this time work for everyone?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Got it. 
 You deserve to be pampered.  I hope it works out so you can go.  I think it would be a hoot.  Kay 
 1.  One director 2.     Probably Global Finance, depending on the structure of the deal. 3.     Humm. 4.    I guess I see the question as the overall role of outside counsel in the transaction.  Good discussion item.  Kay 
 I would like to sign up for the new garage, please.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I don't think she's in.  You might want to leave her a voice mail. 
 Thanks.  I've been trying to puzzle my way through this.  Kay 
 We have our staff meetings the 1st and 3rd Wednesday at 130.  I missed the last one, so I should make it to this one.  Kay 
 Enron as the buyer or seller?  I have an Enron as the seller (kind of a weird deal, but at least it has most of the issues), but I can check around to see what else is on the network.  Kay 
 Just a reminder that I have a drs appt this am.  Nothing special, just one very overdue check up.  Kay 
 Hi Bruce,  There's a Christie Patrick who is a VP of Government Affairs.  I'm wondering if this isn't the same person you referenced.  I don't know her.  Regards,  Kay 
 FYI.  I haven't read it yet.  Kay 
 fyi, Steve should work with Ms. Clark to determine amount of payoff is required for TurboPark.  Obviously, this is impacted by the date of payoff.  We have discussed with GE et all the prospect of a changed order to the existing master contract for the new ones.  So far, no one can find a problem with that approach.  Kay 
 Way c ool. 
 I think we'll still have the breakout contracts, which are essentially finished.  Kay 
 Sounds good to me. 
 I'm sure this doesn't  matter, but I'm in Jeff Hodge/Barbara Gray's cost center.  Just so long as I get paid!  4-13 was a vacation day.  Thanks again,  Kay 
 Here's the electronic file. 
 We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do. I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want to mull it over.  They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you forward the draft change orders with it?  One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be acceptable to GE.  Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone "quiet time" to review the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it.  We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.  Kay

 I was in Clarksdale yesterday, and have a dr's appt this am, but will be glad to give you what I have.  In fact, I could use some help with the EEI if the offer is still good.  Maybe you could just talk me through it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I would go with Sheila's approach.  I don't see a reason not to.  Kay 
 This triggers Delta's obligation to fund the escrow, which now must occur on or before April 20.  If they get their financing in order, it will fund sooner. Therefore, Carlos is working on the drafts of TurboPark documents.  Kay 
 29 Inverness Park Way, 77055 
 Please do.  I"m on a long conference call.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I've raised some of the issues with NW.  We are working on some of it.  A meeting is a good idea.  Kay 
 Thanks for all your efforts, and consistent responsiveness.  I hope you have a great vacation.  Kay 
 YIPPEEE.  Carolyn,  I think we should tender by email.  Kay 
 Took about  8 months.  A new record. 
 We are getting close on this one relating to the Blue Dog turbines.  I'm reviewing these drafts in detail, and expect that there will be another turn.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.  Kay 
 These are the current drafts, not the ones I sent earlier.  Kay 
 I'll look but nothing comes to mind. 
 I don't know either.  Kay 
 Me again.  I forgot to ask you to look at 4.7, 8.3 and article 6 of the LLC agreement.  Just want to check.  Kay 
 Does that mean we will do the pre-pay? 
 I'm tellling everyone that I'm taking off tomorrow.  ckm 
 Maybe having 2 kids and an SUV makes you feel older. 
 Just in time for the weekend.  I hope to take tomorrow off, by the way.  Paige is coming in tonight, and Michael has the day off from school.  Kay 
 Nothing from Ben yet.  If I don't hear from him in the next couple of hours, then I think we should be ready with an extension letter, giving them a couple of days extra for free.  Ben indicated to  me last week that he would give them some time once they asked.  MK called with questions on the assignment - nothing serious.    Kay 
 I can't find any call in info for the conference call on Monday.  I may  be reachable on 713 304 8716, or maybe someone could leave me a voice mail message at the office if there is a dial in number.  Thanks,  kay 
 I hope this is the last version.  Stay tuned!  Kay 
 Hi Warrren,  Could you please print all of these attachments for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 This SHOULD be it.  Please circulate, including Lee.  Thanks once again,  Kay 
 I think Lima would make a great bobble head.  You better get there early.  I received an email from Alfons telling me he was resigning from Technip. I'm clueless why he sent it to me.  Talked to Gerry last week.  He says he is going to put his Kingwood house on the market.  Hmm.  I hear lots of the old gang is working with him now.  Have you gone to your reunion yet?  How was it?  Gotta go home but I didn't want to not write back today.  Hope you find all your Easter eggs.  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 Good morning.  Please call these folks and see if you can set up a meeting of the East Development team either Tuesday or Wednesday:  Ann Elizabeth White Carlos Sole Kathleen Carnahan Barbara Gray Jeff Hodge  The meeting shouldn't last more than 45 minutes.  Please reserve us a conference room on this floor.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This is preliminary.  I'm supposed to get with our finance folks tomorrow to get it finished.  This is ok to send to NW with that understanding.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Hi Ben,  The conference call went fine with NorthWestern.  They really want to get their hands on the contract and the change orders.  I told them you were talking to GE about it, and we will get them the contract ASAP.  Here are the issues:  If we terminate due to their default, they want the additional $5m to be liquidated damages (ie, our exclusive remedy).  They still want the right to talk to GE, specifically about the terms of the assignment to the LLC if we are having difficulty getting GE consent.  They want to be able to exercise their call (or take an assignment) of the turbine contract earlier.  They are willing to take the risk with the GE warranties.  This is a relationship issue.  It is also their biggest issue.  On an interesting note, Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer of all the equipment to Sweetgum. Do you know if Lee knows about this?  Ciao,  Kay 
 Do you want to come to my office for the call?  If so, could you PLEASE PLEASE bring me a caffeine free diet coke?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I believe I land in Memphis around 930 Central.  I'll try to call in if my= =20 cell works.  Kay 
 Sounds good to  me. 
 2nd of 2. 
 This is the first of two emails I'm sending you.  Lee revised the Salmon contract you did, and now it needs to be "unrevised" in these ways.  Kay 
 It isn't necessary unless you want to. 
 Want to join me? 
 Here's some stuff for us to discuss.  Kay 
 Thanks for writing - I deleted your message and then hopped on another conference call.  How about 330? 
 I'll forward your email to Neil. 
 Attached are draft of more of the exhibits for discussion purposes.   See you tomorrow,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Again, Kent is negotiating this directly, so I don't know what the current version looks like.  Kay 
 GE has been negotiating with Freshfields (just like you will be soon) so I don't know what the current version looks like.  Kay 
 Me again.  Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.  I believe we need to restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 yep 
 Are you in the loop on this?  Kay 
 Hi Herman,  This is another turbine transaction.  I think there will be another turn of this doc soon, but I want you to have a heads up.  Kay 
 Are you and Herman ok with this?  Kay 
 Hi there,  I thought I'd check back to see where we are on the Delta (Salmon) break out contract, now that we know that the stabilizers should be included.  How's it looking?  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Monday is bad for me.  The rest of the week looks good.  Kay 
 Hi Tax Gurus,  I was out when you called the other day.  Since then, we have another version of the docs anyway.  Would you like to schedule a time to discuss this with me and outside counsel?  Kay 
 for your info 
 I love free stuff, even agreements.  Any calls from 33?  Kay 
 Welcome back.  I know you are probably really busy.  Paige will be coming home on Thursday.  I told her we might not be leave for PH until Saturday.  I want Michael to be able to go to the Easter egg hunt here if he wants to.  I don't know Paige's plans beyond Thursday.  Since you've been out of town so much, would it help if I took off Friday so that you can catch up?  That still leaves Monday.  Glad you are back!  Kay 
 Thanks!  Kay 
 I'm back.  Last night my little boy was sick, so I guess it was a virus.  I feel good today.  CA time.  Kay 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 Cynthia Kay Mann kay.mann@enron.com I approve invoices and work from remote locations. 
 Scott,  Carlos Sole' is supporting Mitch and John's efforts relating to BPUB, ie, coal fired generation.  Any contracts for that effort should be coordinated through Carlos.  Carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and accounting requirements.  Due to the complexity of the issues some lead time is necessary.  Unfortunately, there are no "forms" for generation projects (given accounting/finance requirements), or any assurance that a contract that worked a month ago will work now.  My preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ENA (or EECC) Legal review.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll be there, too. 
 Believe it or not, they have not mentioned an extension.  They figure we can sign on Friday.   When do you want to talk?  Kay 
 Cool. 
 I have a few comments from our finance folks which I am reviewing now.  Kay 
 Wow.  I wonder how long it will take for me to get a good handle on this stuff?  Thanks,  Kay 
 When we were part of Julia's group, waivers of consequentials in CA's were not standard. I don't know if this was due to an ENA policy (doubtful).  If we are the one giving important information, we shouldn't want to waive it automatically, because consequentials will be the most likely result of the other party's breach. Therefore, in unilateral agreements where we are giving the info, I wouldn't want the waiver.  In the reciprocals it would depend on the circumstance.  If the other party is doing most of the sharing, I would want it.  What say you, Carlos?   Kay 
 I have a 300 meeting, so I'm sending this as is so that David can print a copy.  I have not yet integrated all of his changes, although I have dealt with the profit/savings and QSE.  Is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the Scheduling (aka QSE) stuff?  Later,  Kay  ps Reagan has the latest exhibits. 
 Depends on how much time you give me. 
 You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.  Kay  PS.  Please tell me you shared this info with Rob W. 
 Of course, this doesn't apply to any funds held in a jointly owned  bank or trust account, right?  And when you say "do not", what do you mean?  Does that mean do or does it mean not?  You are confusing me. What does "is" mean, after all?  As I'm sure you recall, Bob Vote handled the last one.  Richard Sanders is the EWS litagation manager, so Mark would probably like for him to know about it.  Richard seems decent.  Kay 
 It finished arriving around 1100 cst.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Opps. 
 John,  The fax is coming in as we speak.  Guess it takes a while to fax it to all those addresses.  Would you mind call Jerry Jerry BoBerry and see what he will tell you is the substance of their issues, and share with him our issues.  I don't see a reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Fine by me. 
 Thanks.  ckm 
 fyi 
 Team Salmon,  Carlos will be working the Enron consent/opinion docs.  I suspect he is looking for a seat at the closing dinner, but the help is appreciated regardless of motive.  Carolyn, the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine.  I spoke with GE about the turbine contract, and I am optimistic that we will have the "final form" today.  Ciao,  Kay 
 Did you ask Lee for a finance contact?  I can't remember.  Kay 
 Isabel,  If you will email me your contact info, I will pass it along to GE.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Even then we could send faxes to the right numbers.  This is ridiculous. Tick tick tick. 
 Sorry to ask, but when do you expect to have a draft of the GE letter?  I need to manage Ben's expectations.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This will be a big help, thanks!  Kay 
 English as a second language? 
 I was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant to discussions we had last Friday)  My point on the fuel plan  was that Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.  There is language in the contract addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.  Kay 
 Jerry,  I didn't receive the fax you referenced yesterday.  Please resend to me at 713 646 3491.  Kay 
 Sounds like both need to stabilizers.  Kay 
 Chris,  I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing.  We are finishing up the break out contract with GE, and assuming we tender it tomorrow, they will have until April 19th to fund the escrow.  Kay 
 What is wrong with these people?  Who faxes? 
 Pete,  Could you call Bill and discuss?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Any first class upgrades available? 
 Does Bill know this?  Lee is going to want to know that you guys are on the same page.  Kay 
 Hi David,  Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you. It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.  Kay 
 CC,  Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be great it you would contact them directly.  The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect that it may well be ready tomorrow.  I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.  Kay 
 What a mess! 
 Steve, I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal. Please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Actually you picked a good week to make the transition since we'll be at the law conference Wed-Friday.  You can ease into things again without us hovering.  Kay 
 I should be in the office in the am. 
 I checked with Chris earlier today and he hadn't heard anything.  The ball is clearly in their court, so I guess we just stand by.  I plan on being back in the office tomorrow.  Talk to you then,  Kay 
 I think I'll just take off until you get back! 
 Thanks,  I'll pass along  your comments.  Kay 
 I vote for you. 
 Carolyn,  Please send GE's comments to the Delta team.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Carolyn,  Please make arrange for distribution to the Delta team.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  GE has asked for an explanation of the relationship of Pegasus to Delta Power (in other words, the equity structure).  Could you please ask Greg if DP can send an email with that explanation, so that I can pass it along to GE.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Would it help if I found the name of some finance contact at Delta Power?  Kay 
 I'd better ask Delta on that one, since there is a financing involved.  I believe PP to be a wholly owned sub/project co, but I'll confirm.  Kay 
 Let's see if I can attach it this time. 
 This is a BIG deal! 
 DAMN.  I hate it when I do that! 
 PP will own 80% of SE, Enron owning the remaining 20%. 
 I figured you knew, but I thought I'd better be certain.  I'm wondering about Bart, too.  Bob said he (Bob) is getting a nice raise, and I heard he got a signing bonus.  Oh, I heard it from Dan,, so you probably know.  Are they looking for someone to replace Pat?  I like Glenn, the temp on 31 who was working for Ben.  I don't know his skills, but he is great on the phone.  ckm 
 I don't feel as bad as I did when I woke up.  My face hurt so badly.  Neil was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths.  It really helped. I'm running a low grade fever, and I know it is a sinus infection.  I took a really hot shower around 5 this morning, but it didn't help much.  Advil helped!  I spent a lot of time outside yesterday, and I'm paying for it. 
 I heard Pat Radford is leaving, and you know Bob Carter is leaving, right? 
 my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the reorganization.  Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have the last).  Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.  I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.  Don't get discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the changes are in my head.  It won't take too terribly long now.  I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move around the doc.  I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of commercial terms included.  Stranger things have happened of course!  Many thanks.  Kay 
 Christi is the one who told me to ask you about native load since you have the tariff.  Small world.  This is getting tricky.  We could ask Oz but I wouldn't want to upset DF.  It just seems like a big deal to leave out of the draft.  Kay 
 I'm sure Friday will work well.  It should be quiet at work since it will be Good Friday.  I know your pictures will be spectacular.  ckm 
 Big hole in the doc without the profit stuff.  Any ideas? 
 How do you feel about making Enron an advisory member of the Marketing Committee?  I'm concerned that we will run afoul of Miss law regarding control.  Would this create a problem for us?  Kay 
 My computer is plugged in to my phone line so I can sit on the bed and work. I feel puny now,  but maybe I'll feel better later. 
 Would you rather do lunch tomorrow? 
 Would you mind faxing me the schedules you emailed me last week?  713 973 0287.  I'm not hooked up to my printer, and it isn't working so swift, and I would like to be able to look at everything at one time.  Muchas gracias,   Kay 
 much grass 
 Hi Reagan,  Could you locate, cut and paste and email me the definition of "native load" from the Entergy tariff?  I need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point.  Aren't we missing some time in the defns of On/Off Peak that you gave me. Aren't 2 hours missing?  Is on/off peak an everyday thing, or seasonal?  What are we going to do about defining profit (and costs)?  Do we need to give a place for meetings, and if so, where should these meetings be? (13 c).  More to come...  Thanks,  Kay 
 They've asked for much the same from GE.  Kent is reviewing the docs.  I'm at home with a sinus headache, but I'm working.  Kay 
 Hi there,  I decided to work from home this am due to a headache.  Kay 
 The balance due to GE is being escrowed at closing, with standing instructions to release payments to GE on a fixed payment schedule.  I will email you the current draft of the instructions.  Kay 
 I had to leave early Friday to pick Michael up, so obviously, today (Monday) is fine.  I appreciate your advice, especially on the opinion.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Final version agreed to by April 11th. 
 We are supposed to try to have the break out contract by April 11, and I think the consents and stuff that same week.  Kay 
 2nd try.  Hope it works. 
 another puzzle piece 
 Hi Kent,  I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be redlined against.  I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel opinion.  Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Tax Gurus,  Here comes another turbine transaction similiar to CA Development and Salmon Energy.  This one is with NorthWestern.  I need to run some tax stuff by you, so here 'tis.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I would really appreciate your advice.  I have to learn it somehow, and I know that you have an excellent idea of what works.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Christi,  per your email.  Kay 
 Here's a new one.  Kay 
 They have a financing out in the letter agreement.  We have to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver GE consents, but I don't recall anything about in other financing docs.  Is someone in the dept designated as the opinion reviewer?  Kay 
 I believe he is going to Reliant.  ckm 
 Nice touch, sending this the day after the letter agreement was signed.  Can you enlighten me on the ENA procedures and sensitivities to these types of docs?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please try Gail Brownfeld, 713 345 3632, or, Gail.Brownfeld@enron.com.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I hear Oz will be there, too.  How fun! 
 Any ideas? 
 Deborah,  This is the most recent email I have from Mark.  It gives an overview of the project.  I'll check for other pertinent emails.  Kay 
 I didn't pick this email up until this am, and I don't have the beginnings of the 2nd draft with me.  Will DF be in today?  Kay 
 Roger Ondreko left the company (or is leaving soon).  Herman brought Billy Flemmin (sp?) yesterday, and Billy seems to be involved in a bunch of stuff.  Your tax guys are Matt Gockerman (state) and Rhett Jackson (federal).  Kay 
 This is the form which needs to be cleaned up.  I may have a cleaned up version.  I'll check.  Kay 
 Hello there,  Here's the LV Co Gen break out contract with the assortment of turbines, including the 3 turbines from the new order.  I haven't quite figured out the route, but I think this is the correct destination.  Due to the Delta schedule, it would be very helpful to get closure on this form by April 10th.  Kay 
 re: Coal fired plant we discussed with Mitch and John. 
 Hi Lee,  Pete Thompson is preparing the LV Co Gen break out contract based on the version generated last week that you and Bill Williams had agreed to (or so I think), but incorporating the AIP stuff where approproiate for the new turbines.  We need to have the Delta break out contract signed by April 11th, so I'm hoping to have the LV Co Gen contract today or early tomorrow for all to review.  That way, you can look at both at the same time, and sign both at the same time.  Pretty nifty!  Thanks,  Kay 
 It may be closer to 630.  Is this still ok?  I'll call first, of course. 
 Hmm.  Not typical.  Reorg?

 Hi Charlotte,  Just confirming that you will be picking Michael up today, and I will pick him up at your place around 615.  He has clean clothes to change into.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Could  you please email me what we think are the execution version of the letter agreement and the substantially complete llc agreement?  Also, how many execution copies will we have?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I need a legal opinion.  What is a non-purchase order? 
 Maybe he cancelled this week since he is out next week. 
 Wrong week - that's next week! 
 See you there. 
 Very out of date, but indicative of the current structure.  Stay tuned. 
 Looks like our exposure is less than $25,000.  Please call me.  Kay 
 I don't really like the organization of it much.  I think things need to be moved around and re-organized. 
 #2 sounds like the CA Development structure to me. 
 It is good airplane reading. 
 Well, don't get too excited until you read it.  There's lots of stuff I just had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in.  Kay 
 I've sent a draft to you and Reagan via email.  There are questions and blanks in it. Kay 
 Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.    Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.  Kay 
 Hi Pete,  Per my voice mail.  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  I can't recall whether Delta et al have seen a draft of the escrow agreement (and instructions) yet?  Is this one in the works?  I suspect GE may want to see it in connection with the giving of their consent.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm checking with Steve.  Thanks,  Kay 
 if you insist... 
 Steve is in my office and he agrees with the approach. 
 Hi Jeff,  I'm tied up on an endless phone call, but wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I got your voice mail, and will get back to you shortly.  Kay 
 I hear your deal blew up.  What happened?  ckm 
 Never mind.  Lee sent it. 
 Hi there,  Could someone email me the latest version of the AIP?  Thanks,  Kay 
 We have a conference call at 300, and you are welcome to join us! 
 Hi Carlos  If things aren't better next week, I may need ask for your help (ie, dump this).  It depends on how Delta and Yazoo City shake out.  Hopefully, it won't be too bad.  Be sure to check out the black line.  Kay 
 Best wishes! 
 Probably tomorrow.  I got a feeling that Dave would like to visit with you about it.  Dismal here.  How are you?

 It would be helpful to see the lease and the letter before commenting.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Probably until 6. 
  I'm too lazy to send to everyone, so please pass it along. 
 The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible.  Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?  Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.  Thanks,  Kay 
 That's fine.

 I have Lotus Notes emails which I can't forward since we've migrated to Outlook.  Kay 
 Hi Eric,  I'm back in the office, and am working on this deal again.  Seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously. Specifically, we need copies of the following documents:  Lease agreement between CES and UST.  Nortel RTU terms.  Bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from TCP to CES.  I can speak with US Telenet's attorney regarding these requests, if you can get his/her name and number or email address.  I know there are some other issues, but getting these documents will really help.  Thanks,  Kay 
 If I'm remembering correctly, it could be Connecticut.  That narrows it down quite a bit. 
 Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.  The numbers don't seem to match, but we won't worry about that now.  The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday.  Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).  Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear.  Thanks,  Kay

 It appeared to me that a GSA would be most appropriate for this work.  In speaking with some other EBS lawyers, I was told that Adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the GSA.  Please let me know if this is incorrect.  Kay

  Feel free to ignore.  I'm talking to Adriana now.

 I'm happy to look at another format.  This was the one Michelle gave me.  Kay 
 I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation. Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't think the Margate issue is enough, either.)  I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January anyway.  Kay 
 The document below contains the guts of the tasking letter, I believe.  The GSA was in the other email. 
  The GSA, without name and address.  Could you forward me the tasking letter once you are done so that I can understand how the pieces fit together?  Thanks,  Kay 
 ok with me.

 Haven't done anything with it since there hasn't been any activity.  If we think that we want to do something, it would be helpful to get a copy of the master.  I don't think I still have a copy.

May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.  Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.

 It would be terrific if I could see the tasking letter before I give final approval to the GSA (since this is really a one-off deal), and I will need to approve and initial both the GSA and the tasking letter.  Thanks,  Kay 
 thanks 
 should be here 
 Kinda wish Kortney would have talked to me and cc'd me on this.  Does this happen much?  Don't know that I have a big problem with it, but it just seems like it isn't purely a Credit issue.  What do you think?  Kay 
 And me? 
 Ben,  I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.  Kay  Kathleen,  Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks. 
 I will have to find a form.  If you think the deal will extend more than a couple of months, or could develop into something bigger, I really suggest an EEI.  Once I find a form we can determine if we need a separate services agreement, or we can bake it into the GTC's/long confirm document.  Kay 
 We don't want to pay them until we get agreement to the form of the docs.  I don't think much will be required, but I just want to make sure it is coordinated.  Kay 
 They've changed the Cogentrix deal.  In fact, it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty.  I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms.  Can you help?  Guess you would like the name of the counterparty.  I'll send it to you.  Thanks as always!  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 The closing docs are on top of my cabinet, near my name plate.  Help yourself.  Thanks,  Kay 
 My 1984 format is a bit out-of-date. 
 Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC 
 Ruth,  Could you print theirs and ours for me since I may not make it to my desk before I come over? Thanks. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Kayne and Rahil,  Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.  For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.  I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.  I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.  Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?  If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?  Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?  If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.  What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?  What are Resource Costs?  How often will we email or fax them a sales summary? Will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?  Kortney, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.  Thanks for your help,  Kay 
 Where are you?  I'm on 6. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 So how come no one will buy for $5b? 
 In hindsight we should have had them pay it.  Oh well.  Got your fax and will check in to others. 
 Gentlemen,  Pursuant to my discussion with Mr. Swift, I am enclosing a draft letter for your review.  Kay 
 Hi Jerry,  Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.  Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.  I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.  Kay 
 The form was fine.  Kay 
 The power is executed, I just need to get the cert signed.  Have a good evening. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I was having trouble with the system last time I tried a couple of hours ago.  I'll try again later. 
 Will do, and thanks.  Kay 
 I just couldn't help myself. 
 No need to hold off.  I'm not worried about GE.  I need Dave to sign one more document.  Is he around?  How do you like your new digs?  Kay 
 Dynegy is getting a very nice building.  See you in a bit. 
 I only have 4 in my box, and none were the ones I gave you.  Thanks! 
 have you faxed the docs yet? 
 Last time I checked I was told that the wire was in the queue.  Kay 
 I see they've halted the sending of replies.  I will see if you should prepare them anyway to send tomorrow.  Here's the list of what we have so far.  I'll give you the letters and Debra is in charge of the files. It may be we don't have to look at every contract to get this done.    Kay 
 I'm  talking about the member interest power in particular.  We don't have to have to send them the Darst stuff today.  I have another piece of paper that Dave needs to sign as well. 
 Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate. By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that. 
 fyi 
 Closing list:  1. Power (executed by DD) 2. Certificate (as is)  3. Darst letter (waiting for GE to sign, copy to be sent to NW later) 4. Letter regarding setoff (need to have WDD sign)  1 and 2 should go to NorthWestern today by fax and fed ex.  3 and 4 can go tomorrow.  Need to notify corp sec also?  Thanks!!! 
 I have made spa appointments at Urban Retreat West for Friday afternoon, beginning at 330. 
 In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:  1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.  2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.  I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.  Kay 
 And that's what it's all about... 
 Good.  Gives us something productive to do! 
 We are considering submitting a bid to provide standard offer service to commercial and industrial end users.  Can you tell me if EPMI is licensed to provide retail service in Maine?  If you aren't the right person, who should I ask?  Thanks bunches,  Kay 
 We should also have forms they previously approved, since we have negotiated a couple of CA's with them in the past. 
 R u going to call? -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.  We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.  Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 you might check with the bank.  My paycheck should have hit by now. 
 New program.  The only termination notices we are responding to are those with termination payment calculations.  Some of the letters were something other than termination/suspension notices, so you might want to check to see if you think we need to reply for other reasons.  Kay 
 Good op ed piece. 
 There will be no holds barred with the Times and the Wash Post weigh in on this one.

 Could you send me the notice of default and our response?  Thanks! 
 I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.  I would think that this shouldn't take very long. 
 I'll be there with bells on and cards in hand.  Ciao,  Kay 
 Is Enron in default under the Sandhill agreements?  How about any other deals you know about, including the Mexico stuff?  Have you inherited Peoples (enovate) yet?  I suspect there may be a default there.  I'm helping gather some of this info, and your help would be appreciated. 
 Thought I would ask a more specific question.  Do you know of any transactions which Enron may be in default due to recent circumstances?  I'm excluding trading deals.  Maybe some of the asset management deals?  Joint venture companies (enovate?)?  Thanks,  Kay

 Travis,  The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.  Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.  We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.  I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  Kay x57566

 Does that look right?  Lorie says it is a WBS code number (Greek to me). 
 Well I hope he puts in a good word for me.  I talked to Carlos, and he didn't say anything about the call you referenced.  Are you sure your leg wasn't being pulled? 
 Interesting stuff 
 thanks.  Do you need anything else from me at this time?  Kay 
 Could you send me whatever you think is appropriate so I can get it in front of the lenders?  Thanks,  Kay

 At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.  More to consider!  Kau 
 Are you still having yours? 
 understood.  I think Kayne needs some help in working through MDEA.  Kay 
 They are talking termination, which may not be justified for the asset management deal. Don't know whether that would be a good thing or not.

 Please print and put in the Fuel Cell binder you  made me last week.  It is on my desk, I think. 
 Everything went fine.  I hope Dan is ok.  Did the antibiotics not work?  I know he has been worried, but I thought he was feeling better. Now I'm worried.  How old would you mother have been today?  I was wondering about Karen.  I wasn't sure what her title was before.  I haven't checked voice mail yet.  Heather called on my cell phone, which was fine.  I hear the Mark (NYC) is VERY nice.  I hope to get back earlier than 600 on Friday, but not early enough to come in.  I'll figure it out tomorrow.  Ciao,  Kay 
 Congratulations!!!!  You should be proud.  I am! 
 I suspect that it wasn't recorded.  My bad. 
 Hi Guys,  Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to the process.  Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?  Thank you,  Kay 
 I found the originals, so please disregard my question about same. 
 How's you dad?  I hope everything went well.  Did you make it in time to see him before the surgery?  Kay 
 I believe this to be the latest draft of the PSCO change order. Kay 
 David,  For information but no action on your part at this time.  Kay 
 I didn't know there were 5 things to get clogged.  What a blessing that he had the surgery before he had a heart attack.  Somehow I'm not surprised that your dad is a quick  healer. Still, going home today is amazing.  Kay 
 You know how I hate to have originals.  Please take them from me!!!!! 
 Once I get the draft I will set up a conference call with the people who can provide the input on the document.  If it would be better to have the call before let me know, and I will try to set it up.  I'm free tomorrow am if that is a good time for you.  kay 
 I have the September 13th invoice.  Could you fax me the rest?  Thanks,  Kay  PS.  I feel like I had previously approved at least one of these invoices. We have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel, so just about anything is possible. 
 FYI.  I've discussed this with Mark and he didn't have any problem with it.  Kay 
 I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.  I've talked to Deb Korkmas about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal with as many as possible at once.  As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name to the reports.  ANy other ideas?  Kay 
 I was wondering if you were there.  Hope the weather is better there than in Houston.  Is there any water in the bay?  Love,  Kay 
 Hi Nancy,  Lisa Mellencamp's time is being consumed by a special project, so I'm working on this PPA.  Could you give me a call at your convenience?  Thanks,  Kay Mann 713 345 7566

 Attached is the most recent draft I have of the change order for the ESA stuff.  I think we need to add the info on drawing numbers and delivery dates for the options, much like we did on change order #2.    Please let me know what you think.  Kay 
 It will escalate over time. That's how it worked for me. 
 This is more like it.  If my flight is on time, I should be able to pick up Michael.  Kay

 I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow afternoon, through the remainder of the week. I'm assisting with the negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.  This is a Jeff Ader/Ozzie Pagan/Heather Kroll deal.  Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep you informed.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you raised.  October 2 sounds good to me for an effective date, but you might as well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.  Good job.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Anything to get ONE thing off the "to do" list.... 
 This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been working on it.  Kay 
 How about 10:00am on Thursday to discuss GE and how to end world hunger? Please let me know if this works for you, and I'll get us a conference room.  Nominations for other participants would be welcome.  Thanks,  Kay

 Deb,  Let's go ahead with POA's for Ben F. Jacoby for ENA, Tarheel Land Development, Edgecombe Development, and Titan Land Development in accordance with Janet's request and ENA standard practice. Deb, I have the impression that this is something you typically handle, although I'm glad to volunteer Kathleen for the task if that would help.  There will be other companies, but we can add these as we go.  Kathleen, please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time. For instance, what are the names of the Florida development companies?  Your assistance is greatly appreciated, as Janet is eager to get this done.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Well, I personally would like your input, although I'm not clear who will end up with it.  Kay 
 We can always do the POA's after the fact, if necessary.  There are something like 45 development companies, so I hate to do them all at once.  I would at least ask Ben to identify key regions. However, you do need the names of the companies anyway, because they are mostly your companies! 
 Please call Mike and Kent directly.  Thanks. 
 Found it.  It was buried beneath a stack.  Looks good.  I would add something to the effect that the appointment terminates if Ben leaves the company's employment.  Thanks,  kay 
 I'm glad you mentioned that fact.  I'll keep you advised of anything I come across that relates to a peaker.  Speaking of which, are you generally aware of a warranty claim against Westinghouse for the Gleason project? I've been helping Mitch out here and there on it.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  Please proceed as outlined.  Kay 
 Ed,  Would it be possible to designate which is East/West, as opposed to just deleting the West entities?  That way, us Easterners will know when we are encountering a Western entity.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I expect Ben to turn up the heat today.  No pun intended. 
 Good thing those offices are big up there.  Must be getting crowded. 
 I've never heard of them. 
 Good idea to give them a heads up. 
 Please call Bruce Silvers with Bingham & Dana in Hartford, Conn, and tell him my trip has  rescheduled.  Please see if he is available to meet on Monday afternoon, preferably in New York (although I'll confirm later).  I think it might be helpful if Nick Palatin was available as well.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Forgot to mention that.  Please ask Bruce to check his availability. 
 fyi.  I'll respond later.  Back to the contract.... 
 We might want to consider meeting with the  FuelCell team in their offices, if this is less intimidating for them.  I  may be able to fly up on Monday am and accomplish what I need to do with BD, although flying on Sunday is fine as well.  TBD.  Kay 
 Fred,  I think Kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of paper.  I trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements, subject to my quick review and the review of local counsel.  Thanks for your cooperation.  kay 
 I made a mad dash to get this revised.  I can't promise that I incorporated everything we discussed, but I figured I needed to get it to you now. 
 Are these the ones which didn't have the date?  This is PITIFUL. 
 Hi Kathy,  Please let me know if you get to the point where the exhibits are all that need work.  If you are there now, please send me the current version electronically.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I've been tied up today so I haven't gotten this to you.   Maybe we can talk soon.  Kay 
 Thanks for checking.  I'm on message 7 of 9, and don't have anything from Bruce.  Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had problems with a document which had to go out today.  Kay 
 I'm in good shape now.  Just a little left for today.  Is Ric getting sentimental?  Losing someone can make you feel that way, even if it isn't logical.  We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow. 
 Stuart,  Kay's venting for the day:  Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?  Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having problems.  Have you mentioned anything to him?  Kay 
 FYI.  I haven't read it yet, but thought I would pass it along anyway.  Kay 
 I don't know if you are in the loop on this one. 
 I may just ask him if anyone else  has had problems with the quality of their work,  and leave out the billing stuff.  If I say anything I won't mention you,although I think you did what you could to control these cowboys.  Kay 
 Hmm.  Can you get a picture of the dog? Neil and I have been talking about getting Michael a dog, and we DO NOT want a puppy. Does she bark much?  Is she hyper? She's a short haired dog, isn't she?  The problem with the document arose after you left yesterday, and I knew I had to get cracking on it early.  I would have had to ask you to be here by 700, and I figure that was just too much to ask!  Thanks anyway. 
 It is yours.  I never said it would last. If fact, it is a tribute to Enron that that era is over.  You've earned the right to doubt my credibility based on your original interview, however. 
 PS.  You will love the government contracting business.  Really, I think you will. 
 Thanks.  I'll keep it to myself.  I think having a list is a sign of progress.  830 am is a bit early to work it into a happy hour.  However, there are lunch possibilities...  The other commercial issue I saw was confirming the invoicing procedures, how/who will calculate cumulative net revenue, and flow of money in general. Fits in with the refund stuff.  Kay 
 Here's the redraft.  I fix up the form for you as well.  Next email. 
 And with this email I bid you adieu, hasta manana, ciao, etc.    Kay 
 I may be in trouble!!! 
 fyi 
 I didn't know he was 50!!! 
 Yes, thank you so much.  It is displayed proudly in my  office.  It is sooo cute! 
 Hi Stuart,  I'm assuming (very dangerous) that you are handling this, as this project does not ring a bell with me.  Kay 
 The attached contains revisions and comments as compiled by EECC and ENA.    Kay 
 I will be out of town, but I think you should definitely be there.  I'll mention it to Sheila.  Kay 
 Hi Stan,  Not to rush you, but do you have an estimate of when you will have completed your review/memo?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please.  Tuesday afternoon is our best bet, in NYC.  Kay 
 I'm glad she sounds so good.  Maybe she can be a back up for next Thursday.  Kay 
 I think we arrive around 215, so 400 is about as good as we can do.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Is this something I should have Heather Brown participate in?  Kay 
 Hi Heather,  Are you available to participate?  I'm not sure what is on the agenda, but I thought I should check your availability.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI.  Kay 
 I couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you, so here 'tis.  Kay 
 Karen,  As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.  I will add that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who repairs the road since they have approval authority.  However, this doesn't seem like a big issue to me.  So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk profile, I'm happy.  Kay 
 Stan,  For some odd reason I am having difficulty forwarding this email to Peggy and Sheila.  Please forward it to them for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Any problems/comments? 
 We don't need her if we aren't going to discuss the loan.  Have you heard from Sara?  I was under the impression that she is out of town this week.  Guess I could walk over there and look.  Kay 
 Just to keep you in the loop. 
 Heather,  Doesn't look like this will apply to you.  The person we need to include in our discussion is out of town.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Janet and Ben,  Ben now has signature authority up to $250,000.  Let me know if you have any questions,  Kay 
 Per your request.  Is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract?  I'm supposed to be working on the changes necessary to make this one 97-10 compliant, but I haven't done it yet.  Maybe you will beat me to it, which is fine by me.  Kay 
 Darn. 
 Hi there!  Sounds like things are going really well.  Neil is working tomorrow (his turn), then we have a wedding to go to Saturday night. Paige isn't coming in until Sunday, leaving Tuesday or Wednesday. She's visiting friends in Waco.  You know how it goes with juniors. So, it doesn't look good for us to  make it to Palacios this weekend.  How long are you going to be there?  Gotta get on the phone.  Love,  Kay 
 Please cancel this.  Kay Mann 
 Please make this right.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm glad you found something interesting to do. Let me know if you meet anybody famous!  We now have televisions in the elevators.  At first, CNN ran all the time. This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP program.  It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.  I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.  I found it difficult to summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college grads.  Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.  I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.  His gain is our loss, but I understand completely.  Take care and keep in touch,  Kay 
 We don't have to meet with them.... 
 Lee,  Your changes to the letter look fine to me.  I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready to go with this one?    We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.   Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently deleted from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Lisa,  Here is the discussion draft of change order #3 for your review, comment, changes, etc. Once it is finalized ENA would appreciate receiving a note requesting that the change order be executed, with the change order initialled by the appropriate person at ESA.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sheila/Dale,  Ben wants Chris to sign this change order.  I believe it is in essentially the same form as when I sent it before.  Please advise is there are any changes you want made.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to Palacios -  makes the fun last longer.  We won't even celebrate our anniversary until the weekend, as I will be out of town Tuesday-Wednesday (New York), and Neil is gone Thursday-Friday (Dallas).  Tag team parenting!  Love,  Kay 
 Lee,  Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:    I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer, so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.  I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as well.  It is percolating through the system.  Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending the delivery dates?  I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.  I'll be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.  Kay 
 Thanks.  Unless someone catches me, I'm out at 430. 
 I don't know.  I'll ask Suzanne. 
 For the calendar. 
 Nancy,  Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:  As a general note, we would have these goals:  1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in the interconnection agreement. 2.  Minimize ties to specific unit. 3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points. 4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet. 5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.  More specifically we would like to:  Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement. Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be determined. Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.  Comments on specific articles: Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement. 2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect. 2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term "breach" should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site. 3.4  Peak period is July and August. 3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity. Might just leave blanks as placeholders. 3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice. 3.5 (d) suggest title "Start-Up Minimum Run Time". 3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year. Need a minimum shut down time between start ups. 4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it throughout. 8.1 (c)  replace "covenant" with "obligation", and follow with "(other than payment)". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence. 8.1 (d) remove "shall" and conform grammar in romanettes. 8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8? Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok? 9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an invoice? 10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second "Seller" be "Buyer"? 15.  No mediation. 16.1  Delete oral amendment language.  Exhibits: A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600. Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.  Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any questions/issues.  Please let me know your availability.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Richard,  When you get a minute I would like to catch you up  on these issues.  I think it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two Westinghouse issues we have.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Lisa,  Per your request.  Kay 
 Karen,  Please provide a redline version of this document against the Fehr option, or whichever previous document you started with.  Thanks,  Kay 
 She makes me crazy the way she copies three lawyers in her firm eveytime she writes me.  A pet peeve! 
 I leave tomorrow, and will be back on Thursday.  There's a bunch of food up here today.  You might want to make the trip up this way. 
 Hi Kathy,  I can't remember if you are in the loop on this one.  Kay 
 Hi Bart,  I think this is at least close to the final draft. It ain't pretty but it seemed to work.  You won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions, so long as I get a copy of the new-and-improved version.    Kay 
 I am so sorry to hear about Annie.  Did it break in a different place? I think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell what is happening.  Michael had a good time. Thanks for having him.  He was SOOO excited when Paige got home yesterday.  He is just crazy for her.  Thanks for the bird house.  We are going to put it in the kitchen on top of the cabinets.  All is fine here.  Just buzy as usual!  Love,  Kay 
 Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.  Love,  Kay 
 Did you RSVP for me as well? That would be extra points! 
 As requested.  Please call if you need anything else.  By the way, I have the original contracts in my office.  Kay 
 I haven't looked at this yet...  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  My initial reaction is that it is ok for a  small gambling debt, but a little thin for a $50m revolving line of credit.  Kay 
 I found it. 
 Hi Sweetie,  You know how Paige is about directions, etc.  Feel free to call her, though.  I ate all vegetables for lunch, but then I had a third cookie.  Annie broke her arm again, and may have to have surgery.  Kay 
 Latest.  I think it just changes my seat assignment.  Kay 
 Heather,  I'm guessing that Peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit agreement.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Kay 
 That should be easy enough.   Paige needs some glasses, and that could run $200-$300. Dental is also covered, if we have any uncovered dental expenses.  I'm going to guess we might have another $100 in prescriptions to fill this year as well.  I could stand some new glasses also.  Your Eckerd's glasses can also be submitted.  We need to forecast for next year, as open enrollment starts soon.  Kay 
 Remind me to check the Harry & David's catalogue for something nifty.  Kay 
 I'm O positive, and used to work with Bob.  I'm on the road until Thursday afternoon, and give give blood on Friday.  Kay 
 fyi, for fuel cells and CRRA 
 Nancy,  Please call me about this.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Hi Dale,  I would contact Kathy Clark.  As far as I know, there have been no change orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).  Kay 
 Did you get these?  Kay 
 We must hang together less we hang separately. 
 Are these the correct dates on Change Order #4? 
 Is this ok with everybody?  It incorporates GE's latest comments.    Kay 
 FYI. 
 I need details. 
 Chris Calger will sign for ENA on #2.  I believe his title is a vice president. Dale Rasmussen has offered to handle signature. I haven't gone through all my emails to see if it is ready to go.  Janet will sign #3 and #4.  Kay 
 I think the effective dates have been relating to when the deal was cut. That's as much a guess as anything.  Ben left me a voice mail that said he had gotten something from ESA on #3, but I haven't made it through all my emails to see if I have it. I will send it to you if I do, of course.  I would think #4 is ready as soon as I get confirmation that the dates are correct.  Again, I have to check my emails.  I heard a rumor about 5 (but am now drawing a blank), and haven't heard of any others.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 I'm available any time except 300-430 on Monday.  Have a good weekend. 
 This deal never closed, so it must be the perfect contract.... 
 Please print and add to my Fuel Cell book.  Thanks.  Kay  ps please print a second copy for John however you spell Clawburg. 
 Hi Chris,  Any opinion on the major component question?  Kay 
 Carlos,  Having some difficulty finding another job?  Happy Anniversary.  Sorry I wasn't here to take you to lunch.  Kay 
 Kathy Clark as EECC has the electronic version of the turbine contract. Rob Taylor at Andrew & Kurth probably has the electronic files for the other document.  Rose Engeldorf might have the electronic files as well.  Kay    Enron Global Finance 
 Hi Paul,  Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?  Looks like we might have some business.  I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had any comments.  I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss it.  How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Guys,  I think the price of the turbines will be the internal Enron price.  Sheila has the magic number per turbine.  Kay 
 Hi Kent,  I was wondering if we could schedule a conference call to discuss the form of these agreements.  Are you available any time soon?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I have a conference call that starts around 1030 and is scheduled to go to 1230.  Otherwise, no lunch plans.  Kay 
 Viola. 
 Hi guys,  I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.  Kay 
 If you don't hear from me by 1245, I probably won't be having lunch. 
 Could you please get me some post it notes, various sizes, cool colors preferred.  Thanks! 
 I'm still in my conference call.  Do you want to come visit later (in other words, need to get out?) 
 Please print and put in folder, Off Balance Sheet EPC Contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 If I had a printer, I wouldn't ask you to print this, but since I don't....  Thanks,  Kay  PS  Don't worry too much about Ruthie.  You'll get her figured out. 
 Is it true that tomorrow is your birthday?  If so, Happy Birthday!!! 
 You did better than I did.  I was telling people I was 41 when I was 42.  I felt terrible when I realized I was older than I thought!  Oh well, it just goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.  I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the same group and process. Neat trick, though.  I wish Carlos was here to do a lot of this, though.  Kay 
 Why don't you try feeding her again at night?  Maybe she will sleep better. I feed Jack twice a day, and he is still skinny as a stick.  Isn't she on the thin side anyway?  All dogs go through adjustments.  She may be trying to find out who is the boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.  ckm 
 Ta da... 
 Anybody uncomfortable yet? 
 Joe,  Would you like to renew with a letter agreement as in previous years?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I've been out of town, and have back-to-back meetings/conference calls.  I'll call you though.  Kay 
 fyi.  This form came from Global Finance. 
 Have a great trip! 
 Hi Gregg,  Per your request:    See ya,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:  1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the construction activities.  2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts. Does anyone care?  3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Barbara, here is the document I discussed concerning some of the Chicago stuff.  Jeff, I don't know if you have received this from Gregg all ready.  Kay 
 I've given blood at MD Anderson before, and I think they will have the blood type  information on file.  If anyone else is in the same boat, you call the number below and ask for Barbara. I couldn't reach her today, because it is Saturday, but they tell me she will be in on Monday.  If all goes well, I could be in business fairly quickly.  Kay 
 Suzanne, please forward this to Jeff.  My email is acting up again.  Hi Jeff,  I thought I would pass this email along to you since you've been working on some of the aspects of the Peoples deal.  I don't want to interfer with whatever you have going on, but I'm happy to assist/participate in whatever way makes sense.  Kay 
 I don't know if you got this, so here 'tis.  I was out of town and missed the presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these issues.  I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet treatment of power plants.  Kay 
 I understand completely.  Those ear infections can be very painful.  Nothing can get to you like your kid in pain.  If it makes you feel any better I have a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable), and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections, etc.  My oldest  also had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.  But she out grew the problem.  I expect to be in town Mon-Thurs, with high hopes of taking Friday off to join my husband at his officer's meeting in San Antonio.  Kay 
 My morning is fairly open, other than grinding on the purchase contract. 
 I'm available.  As I  mentioned, I'm still working away on the revised equipment contract.  Kay 
 Heather,  Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time?  It would help me get finished with the FCE doc.  I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging.  I wonder if that makes ONSI a part of GE?  Does GE have a fuel cell product yet? It would explain the statement in the Journal that headquarters would not be in NJ or Connecticut.  Kay 
 Shall I handle items #1 and 2?  Kay 
 I am waiting for a call back from MD Anderson concerning whether they were able to locate my information.  Their records go back to 1998, and I believe I gave at MD Anderson in 1998, but you know how that is.  Assuming that all goes well, I can go tomorrow at 930am (when they open.  I'll keep everybody posted.  The folks at MDA confirmed that they have Michael's consent forms ready to go, just in case that question should arise.  Bob, sorry to hear about the doctor, and the impact it must have had on Michael.  Kay 
 I'm going to guess that it depends on whether you are giving a direct donation (as in this case) or a replacement donation.  Since it is for a specific patient, they may want to make sure it works, especially since it will keep you from donating for a while.  Just a guess! 
 How's this? 
 okey dokey 
 Good idea.  I'll let him know. 
 I think Piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat.  He's a sly one. Roger's first story was ok ("I didn't think he was running, I was tossing the bat to our bat boy").  Second version was a little iffy ("I didn't know if I had the bat or the ball" - why the hell would he throw the ball towards the dugout?)  The Turner wedding was amazing.  Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the wedding. Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving. When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents)  the band was still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.  Unbelievable.  I wonder how late it went.  I'm out of town this weekend - Neil's officer's meeting at the Hyatt Hill Country, then up to see Paige on Saturday, back on Sunday.  Let me know if it reschedules.  Did you change jobs?  What do you hear from Ben?  Anthony called me last week, just to chat.  They are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here.  Kay 
 Did you hear Candy is moving to Holland?  She looked great.  I didn't know she was married until I saw her.  She seems happy.  Sounds like Ben found a good head hunter.  It can be hard to get positive after being in that environment.  Kay 
 I'm thinking you don't have anything to move.  Maybe it would help if you acknowledged that ENA might not be your final destination, but seems like a good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites, such as Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets - both new businesses with international aspects. Plus, lawyers at ENA move between groups without much fuss and bother (if it changes, don't blame me later!)  How does that sound?  Kay 
 Paul,  FYI.  This is the document which starts the move into the ABB facility agreements.  Kay 
 To keep you in the loop.  Kay 
 Is everyone available for a brief conference call at 830 Tuesday morning? Please let me know if you aren't available.  Dial in instructions will be forthcoming.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Do you want to generate one just like the rest?  That would be the easiest way to go.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Paul,  When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting urgent.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The attached is marked to show changes from previous draft seen by CRRA.    Kay 
 Hi Matt,  Sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by Global Finance for Turbopark (does this ring a bell?)  If you can get me the docs on this LLC, I'll see if we can pitch the angle Sheila suggested.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Marty,  FYI. Sheila mentioned that Mitch is one of your guys.  Kay 
 Ok.  I'll follow up.  The insanity continues.  I finally called Lee Johnson at S&S, who fortunately had called me, and asked him if he knew if Kent was around, as I hadn't heard from him.  He is going to get in touch with Kent for me.  I'm expediting Paul Pipitone re the ABB facility agreement, but haven't heard back from him yet.  Hope your trip is going well.  Kay 
 Hi David,  It is just us chickens, Gregg's agenda.  Kay 
 Hi Jeff,  I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted.  I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a friend's son who has leukemia.  I don't think it will take too long, but they don't open until 930.  Kay 
 In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with Peoples.  It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.  Gas would be a plus.  I've used Jones, Day  (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad experience).  Any suggestions?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Kathleen,  We have forms for confidentiality agreements.  All CA's are processed through Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.  Kay, could you point Kathleen to the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft? By the way, I've assembled the emails I received on changing the form.  I'll be happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start with.  I know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll get the draft working, but it would probably be a good idea to discuss this a bit.  Kay 
 Is this a PIG deal? 
 Remember when the biggest accounting issues were mark-to-market?  Ahh, the good old days.  Kay 
 Please prepare a fed ex package to go out tonight, as described below.  Also, please prepare a transmittal letter to Heather for me to sign.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Janet has already signed Change Order #2, so adding value to this one will required that change order #3 be revised, then we would have to go back to ESA for their approval. It would be easier on this end if we could pick up the new stuff in this one to a subsequent change order?  I spoke to Lee Johnson yesterday about all the change orders, and a couple of outstanding issues.  I am having difficulty getting GE's attention on the facility agreements, and would prefer that the change orders not be given to GE until I at least get a call back on the issue.  If this is a problem, please let me know.  Kay 
 Hi Kathy,  Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6  Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and replace of business days for Business Days.  1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the tests listed on Exhibit E.  The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of the installation option when I did a search.  3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?  4.3  Delete "Each".  5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm interpretting it incorrectly.  5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"  6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller would be charged interest if not timely paid.  10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.  I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back option. You should have it today.  Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be appreciated.  As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Bob,  My donor number is 1181819.  Let me know if Michael needs more.  As you know, I can go back in 56 days.  Here's hoping all goes well.  I'll have your family in my thoughts and prayers.  Kay 
 Joe,  Here tis:  C. Kay Mann Sr. Counsel Enron North America 1400 Smith, Suite 3841 Houston, Tx 77002-7361  fax 713 646-3491  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sheila,  I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can we adjust the time of the GE call?  I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market stuff, but I could be wrong. I just don't get the feeling that it is directed to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture. Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?  I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.  A & K really dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.  Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish (Honeywell).  I heard it increases their size by a third.  So I guess the 800 pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla. (ok, I admit I used the calculator).  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 To all,  As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB. I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you are aware of any others.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Can you send me a copy of a professional service agreement?  I need to prepare one. 
 Stephen,  Wanna go ahead and print the tasking letter and I'll initial it?  Kay 
 Thanks for the help.  I'm sure more questions will follow!  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 I did not authorize anyone to initial any version of the document.

 YEAH!!!!  Something I can put on the list and take off!  Shall I send it directly to Tracy?  Talk to you at 1100.  Kay 
 I thought you would enjoy this.  And I didn't make any comments about being right about not going to a MEGA university. 
 Ok.  When are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues we need to address to get this wrapped up?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Let's aim for Thursday am.  I'll get back to you later today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kathy,  I know I owe you a phone call.  I'm home with a sick kid today.  Please email me your number and I'll give you a call.  I can't believe I've forgotten it.  So how are you doing with the EECC changes?  Kay 
 Hope it is going well out there.  Michael is sick (I'm guessing strep), so I'll be calling in from home today.  Kay 
 Hi Scott,  It is a sick kid day (I'm guessing strep, with the 102 plus fever). Fortunately, I have most of what I need to get a draft of the equipment contract turned.  I'll email it later.  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I'm home with my sick son this am.  (It was one of those 102 plus fevers at 430 this morning.)  I've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff sent out so we can get some work done.  Talk to you later,  Kay 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Hi Scott,  I have some questions:  The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?  Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard foundations (as opposed to a credit).  On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some monitoring ability.  On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.  Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact payment?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi.  Don't forget you can reach me by email.  Good catch on the fever this am!  Love,  Kay 
 Maybe it is viral.  I haven't really looked because I want Rey to see him since we are leaving town, so my opinion isn't as important.  He is starting to slow just a little.  He ate a good breakfast, but he is getting quieter.  ckm 
 If it is ok with you I'll let you know in a little bit. 
 More questions:  We have two different levels of guarantee values.  We have the specific performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.  This includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and discharge).  Will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that FCE will have to work to try to fix?  I'm assuming there are no sound issues.  Thanks again,  Kay 
 How's Annie doing?  Has she seen her regular (sigh) orthopod yet?  Do the girls (and I guess you grown ups can probably go, too) want to go to SU? Are the young ladies interested in spending the night?  I'm home with Michael (the 102 fever drill), working at home.  Hi to all!  Love,  Kay  PS  Thanks for the traffic tip.  Do the games last about 4 hours?  I can't remember. 
 Why not.  You can tell how much Michael seems to be enjoying school. 
 Please print and fax to me at 713 973 0287.  I'll forward a couple more I need faxed.  Thanks  Kay 
 Please print and fax to me at home.  Thanks 
 Here's what they suggested (yes I'm working, I can do two things at once)  There is a rule of halves - you can give half to your kids, you get medicaid when the retained half runs out.  There is probably a time period you can do this.  Kay 
 Stan,  I have one minor question.  Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following y event?  I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this EPC different terminology is used.  Kay 
 Here's a redline against our previous draft.  There are lots of holes, in large part due to the significant commercial issues still open and some of FCE's input due on the language to be used.  I'm also not finished with the project management/scheduling stuff, but I wanted you to get a chance to look at it forthwith.  Scott, I've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input.  I don't know when we want to give FuelCells a draft, but I'm going to keep working on this one.  Kay 
 Good.  That lets me massage it, review my notes, and perhaps even read it!  Kay 
 I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician, so it depends on how long that takes.  I'll find the instructions and email them to you.  If I'm not on there but Kent is, could you let him know I really need to talk to hiim?  Thanks  Kay 
 888 285 4585  host code 121970 
 The appointment with the pediatrician is at 1100.  I catch up with you later today.  Kay 
 you can open it and hold it.  I know what it is. 
 Hi Barbara,  I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.  I'm familiar with the people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.  Kay 
 I'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as I have strep throat (Michael and I got a group rate at the peditricians' office.) Who should I contact?  Kay 
 Claude,  Could you please fax this to Heather?  You might want to call her to make sure she is still at McCary's office.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Heather,  Here's a form of LOI we can use.    Nancy W. called and is ready to discuss the PPA.  We can call her after our meeting, or before if you have the time.  Kay 
 Scott,  Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is optionality.  I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC instead of messing with an assignment later.  I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what we need to keep in mind.  Kay 
 Poor Carlos.  He is almost pitiful.  I think it is a great idea to watch for a good networking opportunity.  I'm off on Friday, too.  In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and spent the day at home.  I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow. Is Norman still out of town?  Will you have the house ALL to yourself?  Kay 
 SZ really grows on you, doesn't he?  Just like Carlos.  Neil leaves tomorrow.  He was out ONE night last week.  I am encouraging him to get a hunting lease.  He thinks I'm very supportive. 
 Sounds good.  I'm home with strep (mine and my son's), so I'll catch up tomorrow.  Kay 
 Sc ott, I'm planning on taking your emails and revising the current draft to create a new one.  Your points were very well thought out, so I would like to have the day to get a new draft.  It looks like I will be at home tomorrow since I'm still not feeling well, but I certainly feel well enough to work on the contract.  Perhaps we will get some input from our team in Conn. gang by noon.  How does this sound?  Stephen, Feel free to weigh in with any comments/suggestions.  Your  input is welcome.   Kay  PS I can now print at home. 
 Peter,  Thanks for the update.  By the way, is the new version in Word?  Kay 
 Sounds like a good plan.  I can't wait to hear how it went in Danbury. Sounds like the CRRA meeting went well.  Kay 
 Hi Charlotte,  I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.  Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at all.  Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.  We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.  Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.  Kay 
 That would be great.  We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.  I know he will have things he wants to bring to show you.  Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ("Mom, I have a problem...").  He now has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.  He was torn.  He decided to stick with Ashley. Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!!  Michael is very excited about the weekend.  He just doesn't think it will be long enough!!  Thanks for everything,  Kay 
 He hasn't left yet, but I'll remind him.  Michael gets his school picture taken tomorrow.  Carol Junell takes the pcitures there.  She did our first family portrait after Michael was born.  Kay 
 Ok.  So basically all bets are off if we don't give NTP by September whatever.  Sounds good. 
 Will do. 
 Hi Stuart,  I'm home sick (and with my sick son) again today, but wanted to get this to you.  Kay 
 Hi Rose,  I'm home sick with a sick kid, but I wanted to make sure you got this little bit of info.  Kay 
 Hi Dale,  I thought I'd send this along.  It is the first draft of the "break out" contract for the ABB transformers which go with the LM's.  I thought Sheila told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the LM break out in shape.  This has not been reviewed with ABB yet (in fact, I haven't read it yet), but just in case you want to give it a look, I thought I would pass it along.  Kay 
 FYI.  I had previously asked Paul to revise the LM contract to remove all of the references to WestLB.  Kay 
 If Jeff is happy, I'm happy.  Kay 
 I'm still at home.  I'll be in tomorrow.  I have a fax machine at home, though, if you prefer.  Otherwise, we can see who we can scare up at the office, or you can have Laura sign and I'll initial later.  Which do you prefer?  Kay 
 It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it.  I can print it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever you want.  Plus, I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer she hasn't dealt with initial it.  She is very conscientious about what she signs, and who initials what.  Is the attached form the final final form?  Where and to whom do you want it faxed?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm working on it now.  Maybe we (Enron) could review it tomorrow morning, then send it to FCE.  I can meet around 10:00.  That way, we can get it to them in time for weekend review.  Does that work?  Kay 
 Sounds good.  The email was a good idea, also. 
 Hi guys,  Here are some quick thoughts:  2.10  Suggest we delete "specific" from second line. 3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple of business days before date due. 6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.  I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover. Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.   Maybe "reasonable efforts, short of litigation", something like that?  That's all for the first quick read.  Kay 
 Any problem if I add signature lines on the last page of the document (prior to the exhibits)?  I can do that.  ckm 
 Here's the final final final.  I had to put in a page break before one of the exhibits because it wasn't printing right. 
 Michael probably won't be at school tomorrow, unless he really perks up quickly. However, I was thinking of bringing him up there to get his picture taken, if he feels up to it.  Do you think there would be a problem with that?  Any idea when and where I should take him?  Thanks!  Kay  713 973 6325 
 Charlotte,  Michael hasn't bounced back yet - still getting fever up to 102.  I spoke with Delores, and she said Rey said that Michael had a pretty good dose of strep, so it will take 6 doses of medicine to get it under control.  I'll see how he is in the early am, but I may not take him to school, just so I can watch him another few hours.  If you will be at your office tomorrow I'll let you know how he's doing.  Maybe I can leave on Saturday.  I know he will be very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend.  Kay 
 By the way, did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of? 
 Looks fine to me.  Kay 
 Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her. I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them to you.  Have a great day tomorrow.  Kay 
 Hi Charlotte,  Poor thing woke up with 101.6.  He isn't getting any worse, which means the medicine is doing something, but it  just hasn't done the trick yet.  I'll give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute.  I just can't take him to school until he is better. I would like to hold the option open to bring him in the am.  Once the medicine kicks in, he will bounce back quickly.  Kay 
 Karen Jones (in Portland) and Sheila Tweed have been working on just the same thing, so I'm forwarding your request to them.  Kay 
 FYI 
 Here's the new version with attachment. 
 Here's today's version.  Michael is still running a fairly high fever, so it would be a big help if we can talk via phone.    Kay 
 Yes.  If you called 713 973 6325, it is the number my computer is on.  I'll log off before 1000 so you can call on that number when you are ready.  Kay 
 Sorry to hear about this weekend.  It is kind of sad that Mary Susan doesn't have other options for her birthday.  Not that you guys aren't fun....  Michael and I've been home with strep since Wednesday.  He hasn't gotten better, but I have. So, I'm not going to San Antonion, just heading for GTown tomorrow.  I haven't decided whether I'm taking Michael. If he is feeling better, I'll leave him with his sitter, Charlotte.  Since he has been ill, I'll probably head back to Houston EARLY on Sunday, and won't wait for Paige to get up.  Sorry it didn't work out with girls, but I understand.  Love,  Kay 
 I changed the plant stuff around, swapping most of them for Facility.  I think it is a bit more clear now.  Let me know what else needs to be done.    I'll be leaving in around 1230 to buy a bribe, I mean pumpkin, but we won't be gone long.  Kay 
 Gloria,  I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded locally.  The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file, and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe rev 2).  The new document is the one below.  Please save the redline verision in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll, Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Never a dull moment!  It is hard to get deals done at Enron, which as shareholders we should probably be glad. Chicago is only slightly more difficult because of the utility angle - and mind set.  Michael's temperature STILL hasn't gone done.  And of course, now the weekend is coming.  I guess it is time to call the doctor again.  And you!  Kay 
 This is suitable for framing. 
 Thanks.  Who was able to do it?  Kay 
 Neil left town yesterday.  I can't really complain since he rarely travels. However, he is welcome to pamper upon his return!  Kay 
 She compared the wrong versions.  I'll try again. 
 Here's the latest version:    Kay 
 Sorry I lost my temper.  I guess I'm not accustomed to being transferred to someone else to get things done.  No reason to lose my temper, though.  Kay 
 I had heard that the big E bought out the minority investors last summer. Hadn't seen this coming.  So what's next for Azurix? 
 I'm just now printing it out (takes about 15 minutes), but I'm fine with sending out the redline.  Kay 
 Water is just as liquid as gas.  So to speak. 
 You'll be happy to know that it didn't take long. 
 You might want to request ComparRite, just in case it comes up again. There's isn't any problem getting - both Suz and I have it.  Have a good weekend.  Kay 
 Dear Mr. Schrum,  I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her Tri Delta friends.  I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing to tell you how much I enjoyed it.  I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.  Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university which prides itself on "encouraging contributions toward the well-being of humanity".  My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me in this request.  Thank you,  Kay Mann 29 Inverness Parkway Houston, Texas 77055 
 I'm checking your desk for pom-poms.  ckm 
 Carlos, you have much  wisdom for such a young buckeroo.  If Debbie can't decide and if you can't use the PaperCity photo (it realy is a good pic), I'd go with the first one.  I must say that all of them look pretty, well, serious.  Kinda Gore-like, you know.  Ok, that was a low blow.  I was just kidding!!  Kay 
 I was out sick Wed-Fri, but now I'm back.  Kay 
 I'm waiting to hear from Ben on the buy back, and I need to incorporate some changes which were given to me by others.  I noticed the paragraph headings duplicated themselves on this last draft. Odd.  More to come!  Kay 
 Hi John,  Sorry I missed your call last week.  I was out ill.  I'll give you a call once I dig out from under the paper.  Kay 
 Mr. Keffer,  Asking this crowd to vote was like throwing chum to sharks.  Kay 
 I didn't get your fax last week.  I was out sick so I didn't call Shirley. Could you resend it?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Paul,  I would like to  change my previous response to this email.  I would like to get a cleaned up version of the GE contract (without WestLB references) so that I can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the references to WestLB.  The intial read from GE was positive, but the devil is in the details, of course.  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  Is the Peoples confidentiality agreement moving closer to the top of the list?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Charlotte,  I'm not sure what we are doing at Thanksgiving, but at the most we might go to Palacios, which means that we would be gone no  more than Thursday and maybe Friday night.  I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet, but I know we need to get organized. Also, I think Michael is out of school that Wednesday.  Again, I need to check.  More to come.  As for tomorrow (BOO), we forgot to watch for sundown.  I know, that is hard to believe.  We will update tomorrow!  Kay 
 Well, once again I'm messed up on my calendar.  I thought you were going to be in FW a couple more days.  Michael tried callling yesterday (I think it was yesterday), but of course we missed.  I think I'm in town this week (cross fingers).  I was home with Michael three days last week - we both had strep, but he was worse.  His fever didn't break for a couple of days, so I had to cancel my trip to San Antonio to join Neil at his officer's meeting.  I did make it to Georgetown, and had a nice time with Paige. We are hoping for cooler weather soon.  It is muggy!  Tell Dad hi, and happy fishing.  Love,  Kay 
 I may be able to back up Bart if he has a problem.  I have a conference call scheduled but it is likely to reschedule until later in the day.  Kay 
 SU was fun, but there was  a little incident with a streaker (more like a stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she was front and center for most of their act.  I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course. It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.  Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday night.  Hi to all!  Love,  Kay 
 Did you get this?  The address for you looks odd. 
 Gentlemen,  Here's the most recent version of the equipment contract.  I am including a ComparRite redline version, comparing this version to the Oct 11 version sent by Enron.    I look forward to speaking with you soon,  Kay 
 Ross,  The email was sent last night, with no indication that it did not go through.  Must be the cybergoblins.  I will resend PLUS attach the documents to this reply.     Kay 
 Once again.... 
 They have received it but not opened it yet.  Kay 
 What does your schedule look like Wednesday am?  Thanks,  Kay 
 They should now have at least 3 emails with the contract.  I suspect they may have 4.  I'll know next time!  Kay 
 We've swapped voice mails.  I suspect I'll hear from him this am.  Kay 
 Kinda spooky since they are a technology driven company! 
 FYI.  I'll send a copy of the executed original change order once I get it.  Kay 
 I'm not sure I understand it.  I wonder if they mean payment in full has been made as of the time of the assignment.  I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this, hopefully this afternoon.  Kay 
    Gore good for health-care, fuel cells     By Deborah Adamson, CBS.MarketWatch.com Last Update: 9:36 AM ET Oct 31, 2000 NewsWatch Latest headlines  NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - As Election Day nears, a key question confronting investors is how each presidential candidate will affect the stock market. At no other time in U.S. history is such a question so pertinent, with about half of all households owning equities. In this article, CBS.MarketWatch.com identifies sectors that will get a boost under an Al Gore presidency. On Wednesday, we'll examine the impact if George W. Bush wins. See our full election coverage.            Today on CBS MarketWatch Nasdaq stages early rally; Dow gains NTT DoCoMo said eyeing AT&T Wireless stake European bourses bouyed by chemicals, industrial shares Calandra: Broadband's luster dims Stocks in broad advance across Asia More top stories... CBS MarketWatch Columns Updated: 10/31/2000 9:37:46 AM?ET     First, a caveat: Despite the campaign rhetoric, analysts said, a president has less direct impact on the stock market than do the economic cycle, the stock market cycle, the oil cartel, the global economy, the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates and many other influences. As such, giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear market would be misleading. Where the government has greater influence is in such things as military spending and, more critically, the choice of Fed chairman, said Arnold Kaufman, editor of the S&P Outlook, an investment publication published by Standard & Poor's. Investors also should remember that campaign promises don't always work out. That said, analysts have identified sectors that either could benefit under Gore, or that historically have done well under Democrats. Capital goods If Democrats live up to their "big spender" image, Kaufman said, expect a rise in infrastructure spending. That means an impact on the communications and transportation, among other sectors. His favorite stocks here include Sanmina Corp. (SANM: news, msgs), a maker of electronic components for equipment makers, and Tyco (TYC: news, msgs), a diversified electronics and industrial company. Sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets. Last week, Merrill Lynch chose Sanmina as one of top 10 tech stocks that are expected to outperform in the next six to 12 months. In the fourth quarter, Sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than doubled from the like period in 1999, beating Wall Street's consensus estimate by 10 cents. Revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion. Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial goods and fire and security services markets. Tyco recently completed the acquisition of Mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its position in the respiratory care arena. Fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by 40 percent to $1.1 billion, or 64 cents a share, from a year ago. Sales went up by 25 percent to $7.8 billion. Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Earlier this month, Legg Mason raised its rating on Tyco to "buy" from "market performance." Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns, includes Tyco on her recommended list. Mortgage lenders A Gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these lenders' lines of credit from the U.S. Treasury, said Erik Gustafson, senior portfolio manager for Liberty Growth Stock fund. The argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders. In addition, the SEC's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost companies with reliable earnings growth, according to Bear Stearns. Stocks expected to do well in this environment include Fannie Mae (FNM: news, msgs) and Freddie Mac (FRE: news, msgs), Bear Stearns said. Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., buy conventional home mortgages from banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities. Fannie Mae: Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Freddie Mac: Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Health care providers An increase in government spending on Medicare should boost stocks in this sector. Warren Isabelle, president of Ironwood Capital Management, likes nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises (BEV: news, msgs). Last week, ING Barings raised its rating on Beverly Enterprises to "buy" from "hold." Beverly Enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, reversing a loss from 1999. The company's business is improving because of increased revenue from Medicare and Medicaid. However, Beverly has taken a hit lately because it's adding $50 million to its reserves for patient liability costs for 2000. Alternative energy sources In his book, "Earth in the Balance," Gore called for the gradual elimination of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs. As such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, specifically fuel cell companies, said Jim Lowell, chief portfolio strategist for Adviser Investments Management. One stock he likes is FuelCell Energy (FCEL: news, msgs). FuelCell develops electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion. Last week, Friedman Billings Ramsey raised its rating on Fuelcell to "accumulate," following Chase H&Q's upgrade to "buy" earlier in the month. FuelCell also has allied with Enron (ENE: news, msgs) to develop and sell FuelCell's Direct FuelCel products. Enron has invested $5 million in the company. Company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings. What about tech stocks? Here, analysts have mixed feelings. Kaufman believes both candidates would be good for the sector in general, but Gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust action against Microsoft (MSFT: news, msgs). Lowell thinks Gore's impact would be neutral to negative, but analyst Safa Rashtchy of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray said the Democrat could be good for Net stocks. Gore vs. Bush portfolios Thus far, Gore is ahead of Bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each candidate's possible presidency. Since Sept. 1, Lisa Kammert, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising 12 stocks each that would do well under Gore or Bush. As of Monday, Gore's portfolio has outperformed Bush's by 4.43 percent, based on a simple average of each stock's return. In 1992, the same model accurately predicted a Clinton win. In the Gore portfolio are Amazon.com, Yahoo, Citigroup, Bank of America, Disney, Time Warner, BellSouth, Duke Energy, Tenet Healthcare, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Waste Management. In Bush's basket are IBM, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Transocean Sedco, Merrill Lynch, Bristol Myers, W.R. Grace, Beazer Homes, Philip Morris and Boeing. Going into the last week before the election, Gore has outpaced Bush most of the time since Sept. 1. As for job growth, a study by executive recruiter Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that a Gore administration would boost employment for the mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial banking and forestry.? 
 1)The cybergoblins ate the attachment. 2) OK 3) Which Peoples is it?  Also, I think enovate should sign at CA. 4)  I sent Heather an email re her availability.  There's a bunch of construction near downtown, so I would hesitate to commit to an early call, but I know I'm free after 300 tomorrow.  Kay 
 Suzanne is going to track down Heather, then will call you to confirm if 330 works.  Kay 
 The loan documents you prepared. 
 We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron commercial/financial team.  I don't know the substance of the comments.  Kay 
 I forgot about the fence.  I'm still planning on leaving early - maybe 430 or earlier. Can you leave early, too?  Michael wanted to do something with the spider web.  I would offer to pick Michael up, but I'm not sure that I would beat you if I left at 430 and you left at 500.  Love,  ckm 
 Kinda of like a Mary in a Bathtub, only different.  ckm 
 I'm going to write a $50 check to charity (juvenille diabetes) if that's ok with you.  Kay 
 I left a check in the top drawer (the one with the key)  Kay 
 Kathleen will be bringing it to you, if she hasn't all ready.  Kay 
 Hi Nancy,  It seems we may be scheduling a meeting with VEPCO to discuss the PPA.  July 20th is the current date being discussed.  I don't know how we want to staff the meeting yet, but I do want to check your availability. How does that date look for you?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here are the form exhibits, as we discussed:    Kay 
 Here's my little bit of info:  GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but have not received it yet.  ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it, but haven't connected.  The contract is more straight forward, so problems are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been prepared.  Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on it.  If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the GE contracts.  Austin - this is Stuart's project.  Kay 
 Suzanne,  Please call (not email - he doesnt check it) Paul Pipitone (Andrews & Kurth) and see if he is available for a meeting (or conference call) to discuss the GE facility agreement sometime tomorrow - either am or after 300.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gregg,  Sorry, I thought Suzanne had confirmed it. We are on for 330.  I can call you.  Kay 
 At 330 please get Sarah and Heather Brown (Bracewell) on the phone for me, then I'll get Gregg.  Thanks,  kay 
 Hi John,  Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.  I don't know the status.  Kay 
 I don't remember this one.  Kay 
 Rusty,  You are going to have to refresh my recollection as to this piece of land. Kathleen, could you please get with Rusty or Fred to see what's up.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI.   Kay 
 Let me tell, that is one 225 pound pitiful soul when he is sick.  He has a head cold, so he is going home to go to  bed.  He will sigh and  moan, and carry on like you wouldn't believe.  He will be incapable of discussing anything other than how he feels. 
 Is the October 13, rev 3 the final version?  Kay 
 A call works.  It will be the Enron commercial lead (Ben Jacoby), Stuart Zisman, the GE commercial lead and the GE lawyer.  It is about the contract he prepared (although now I wonder).  If he prefers to have whoever will be doing the drafting, that's fine, too.  Kay 
 Gentlemen:  Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB. It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.  It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.  Kay 
 Per my voice mail 
 Please print the blackline for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 CST.  That was right, right?  I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning the revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection (objecting=volunteering to turning the next draft!)  Kay 
 Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM    ?Mail this article to a friend  (Corrected 1:59 pm)  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said. The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator projects with the California Independent System Operator. The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from the public, or it could be modified. Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for installing the new generators, which the power companies will own. In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered CalPX. "There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap," Enron's Mark Palmer said. Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects. FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights on.

 I see Ben keeps calling me.  Any idea what's up?  I probably have another 30 minutes on this call. 
 Probably wouldn't hurt.  Tell him I'll be on for another hour.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sheila,  I believe I can help Lisa with this information, at least confirming some of the stuff for her.  Kay 
 Your list is very close to mine.  I'm making a list as I go back through the draft, so I'll update when I get through.  Kay 
 Hi Dale,  We are meeting with GE tomorrow to talk about this.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.  Ditto on the ABB agreement which I forwarded not too long ago.  Kay 
 Do you have Thomas Heatherington's card (Bracewell guy)?  Thanks,  Kay 
 This looks like it belongs in the specs.  What do you think?  Kay 
 Hi Scott,  I have these questions:  What do we mean by configuration?  We are telling them that we will give them the configuration by date x, but I'm not sure what we mean.  What was decided on spare parts, if anything?  I know it is repetitive, but could you email me a basic timeline of what you see as the key dates for site designation, shipping, anything else you can think of?  I've started a timeline but would like to cross check.  I was hoping to have it done before noon, but the 930 conference call will impact that.  I have a meeting this afternoon from 230 until 500 or so, so I'm trying to get done before then.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please call Ben Jacoby and see if we can push our meeting to 230.  Please advise Stuart that I'm planning to meet with Ben at 230, and invite him to join.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sheila went to these. I believe they cover the activities related to the development of the various site.  I'm on a conference call or I would have called.  Kay 
 You don't need to re-number the definitions yet.  Thanks,   Kay 
 Ben,  This email has the prices in Exhibit N of the current draft agreement.  Are these the correct numbers?  Kathy and I discussed your comments, and she is making changes to the contract consistent with those comments.  She is not available this afternoon, but is free tomorrow am to discuss the contract. Please let me know if tomorrow am works for you.  Kay 
 Perfect. 
 Sounds right.  I'll tell Barbara.

 The word Suzanne heard is that they are moving everyone to the Enron Corp book in the somewhat near future.  They moved me there from EI when I transferred last March.  Kay 
 Kent,  There isn't anything attached that I can open.  Am I doing something wrong?  Kay 
 I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good. 
 Gentlemen,  I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any substantive comments:    I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or technical.  We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Kay 
 You have to admire the initiative!  Suzanne is adding your changes to the purchase agreement now.  Kay

 Off the internet:   FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free. "The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades," said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. "This application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions." According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion market. "The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in benefits for all concerned," said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of FuelCell Energy. "Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users." Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. "This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment", said Walt Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center. "We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems." "In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells," said Leitman. Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process. About FuelCell Energy, Inc. FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation. FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and industrial applications. 
 I accept the terms & conditions of this Pilot Participation Agreement.  Kay Mann 
 I just completed a lengthy call with A & K concerning the form facility agreement.  A revised draft should be out mid-day today.  I have once again called ABB, but haven't heard back from them yet.  Kay 
 I think it is a great day to work! 
 I asked Paige what she was doing for Thanksgiving.... 
 I could nap in this weather.  Maybe I'll leave early. 
 Hi Kathly,  Note addition of word "Purchaser".  Guess the haul and install stuff is up in the air.  Kay 
 Hi Jordan,  I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.  Peoples and Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.  Each of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.  It is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah Wesner has been involved in the process.  Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to run this transaction through your group for blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.  I can give additional information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll send the blackline when I get it.  Kay 
 Any word? 
 I'll have to check.  I haven't heard of any problems.  Kay 
 As requested, I went the abbreviated route.    Kay 
 Please print this monster.  Kay 
 Have you noticed that almost all my documents are monsters?  Kay 
 I believe I was told Richmond. 
 Hi Kent,  I believe this to be blacklined against the original document.  Please note there are some comments/questions included.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Gregg,  Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.  Since Corp will be loaning the money, I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, so to speak).  Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate is priceless.  Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...  Strange choice for a company name!!!  Kay 
 I got a draft of the CA from her this am.  I'll give it a look and get it to you today.  ckm 
 Please confirm the version of the document which was the basis of the compared version.  Thank you,  Kay 
 When I run a CompareRite redline I get a different number of changes, so I was unclear as to the compared documents.  Kay 
 Scott,  I ran a redline comparing the version we sent last Thursday and their new clean draft.  It shows a different number of changes.  Here's the Enron redline:    Too much paper!  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  FYI.  Kay 
 I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal.  When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!  We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll probably figure things out in the next few days.  We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans. I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.  Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way today.  Love,  Kay 
 Joel,  Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.  As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as possible.  If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.  Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate most of their legal issues now.  I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 Here's what I can give you without talking to anyone:  I am not familiar with the Goldendale turbine (#7 on ENA long list). ENA's CTG group lists #7 as being an EECC turbine for Goldendale, not an ENA asset.  I don't know the 2 used GEC turbines (#8 on ENA long list).  On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew this).  I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal; I don't know about the Choc. Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA projects.   Maybe these are sleepers.  I can chase down more info, and Sheila probably has  a great deal she can tell you just from looking at the list.  Kay 
 Sheila,  I should have sent this to you as well.  Kay 
 I'm just about half done with the chart, so I thought I would share it with you for comment. 
 This doesn't have the latest from what you sent.

 Please print the attached on letterhead.  I'm leaving for Connecticut shortly, and will be back in the office on Thursday (or so I exepct).  Please handle the following  Call David Runnels at A & K and tell him thanks, but I can't use the opera tickets this weekend.  Cancel my RSVP for Carrin Patman's lunch tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please call him. 
 Latest version. 
 I don't have it. 
 She's making them now. The trip just came up 30 minutes ago. 
 Here's a redraft of one letter, second to follow: 
 Remarketing. 
 Ross,  The only thought I have with respect to this request would be that it should not apply if FCEL has failed to comply with its warranty obligations, or has declined to service the modules after the warranty period has expired.  Kay 
 Lou,  Did someone do a PUHCA analysis in connection with the Peoples/Enron LLC formation?  Kay 
 Joel,  I didn't work on the deal, so I'll have to check around the Legal Dept.  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I'll check around here to see what I can find out, but I thought I'd ask you if you know the answer. I'll also check with B& P.  Is Sarah off of this?  I hope I didn't open a can of worms.  Kay 
 Evidently GE feels that we already have an agreement based on something Brian signed before the agreement was reviewed/approved by Tax and Legal.  The internal process is not working.  Kay 
 I'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the VEPCO deal.  I've limited it to the land in Edgecombe County, changed the initial period to 90 days (with 3 x 90 day renewals).  The price is changed to $137,600, as have the option payments ($3500 for each 90 day period).  Is there anything else which needs to be changed?    FYI, I've left a message for Dutch Bumgarnder, VEPCO's lawyer, concerning the interconnection agreement, and who is doing what.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  Was there a PUHCA analysis done?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her. do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.  On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.  Ta ta for now,  Kay 
 I'm HERE!!!  How about the reorg?  Mark H looks like he came out great.  Kay 
 Could you please print this, and put in a big binder?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Looks good to me. 
 Here's the agreement I would like to get in front of Mike.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print the black line and put with the binder you are building. 
 Another for the book.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Any practice area preference?  ckm 
 Rusty,  Let's meet at your convenience.  We need to identify some of the tripping points and critical path items, especially since our goal (I assume) will be to keep equipment, EPC contracts, land (?), etc off Enron's balance sheet while things are developing.  Talking through the process should help.  Kay 
 Attached are two letter our commercial lead on the salt soaked unti wants to send.  Kay 
 Ben,  As a retired trial lawyer, I prefer saying less whether than more. I'll bring the letters down and we can discuss specifics. 
 Jeff,  I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume along.  I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly. He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied transactional background.  As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.  EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to ENA (or EA, whatever we are called). He discussed this with Vicky, so she is aware that he is checking out opportunities here.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I thrive on pressure.  My birthday is January 11th.  Is that close to her due date?  Kay 
 Hi Guys,  We don't expect to deal with the facility agreement until around 130, so there isn't a need for Lee to listen to the rest unless he wants to.  Lee, you are more than welcome to come in person, in which case I can give you some exectued change orders.  Kay 
 Oh well.  Jeff is in London, but will be here on Monday.  Kay 
 I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.  This week I stayed at 52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison. Madison is close to 5th.  I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.  The weather is beautiful here.  Hope it lasts a couple of days.  Neil loves his pig.  I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.  Have a great day!  Love,  Kay 
 De nada. 
 Due to the sensitivity of the information, we'll be specific.  Also, should this be addressed to Bill or Curtis, or someone else?  Kay 
 I know the feeling. 
 We can discuss this am. 
 Please call Paul Pipitone (Houston) and Peter Thompson (he's in DC) and ask them to call in at 130. I'm not sure Paul will be joining us, but Peter has confirmed.  If we are delayed we'll let them know.  How long did you reserved the line?  I can see the call going until 330.  Kay 
 As usual, the lawyers are the last to know.  Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days. Please review the attached and give me a call.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks for the info.  I'll give it a look.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jackie,  Would it be possible for you to mark up the list of comments, highlighting which are outstanding?  Marked by hand and faxed would be great.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I just opened it.  It came in last night. 
 I wasn't sure from your email if you wanted to review it now, or wait until Jackie and I sort through some things.  Kay 
 Here's a rough draft of a different approach to assignment.  Do you think it fits with the possible structures?  Kay 
 Hi Mike,  Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.  Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.  Thanks,  Kay  713 345 7566 
 Scott,  As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access the resources in their group, however.  FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for you to look at.  As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent. Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.  Kay 
 I don't have a problem with not back dating it. I'll see if there's a sesitivity to it from ABB's side. 
 Gentlemen,  Attached are GE's comments which I just received.  They are concerned that we tried to improve the contract.  Oh well.  I hope to get this resolved today so we can wrap it up early next week.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 I can assure you that no improvement in the relative risk allocation was intended.  They pointed out what appeared to be some disconnects, and in some cases I ok'd them putting the suggestions in for discussions purposes.  I wasn't trying to play games.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 As I fix I was going to offer to let GE pick up 1/2 their bill....  Kay 
 Hi Mark,  I thought I was in my "final" office.  Where am I moving?  Kay 
 FYI,  I expect to be on vacation that week.  Kay 
 Hi Jeff and Barbara,  I would really like to stay where I am, if possible.  I like being close to Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall.  Thanks,  Kay 
 We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the break out contract.  We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be close to final as far as the form goes.  I have also asked A & K to prepare a memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the document.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Barbara has asked that I submit a weekly report about what I'm working on.  I haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket items:  Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.  Enron owns equity and holds warrants for Fuel Cell stock.  We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the benefit of the warrants.  The commercial team is  working on a deal to place 50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.  I have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently completed the LOI with CRRA.  We need to move to more definitive docs with CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete. The decision about whether the state will fund the project is expected in December.  This deal is likely to continue to take up a large amount of  my time, and requires a fair amount of travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.  This transaction is on Dave D and Janet D's radar screen, and  Mark is familiar with it.  The potential upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.  Turbopark.  Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects. Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.  This requires a series of contracts with GE (at least 6) which I am working on. We also have to move transformers into this facility, so I have been in contact with ABB concerning same.  GE general.  ENA is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with GE. I've been working with Sheila on this one.  We are committed to finish this project by the end of this year.  Westinghouse warranty issues.  ENA has two significant disputes wiht Westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines.  I'm riding herd on resolving the issues.  VEPCO.  We were attempting to negotiate a PPA with Virginia Power, but ran into some problems, so it won't close this year.  Theres' some miscellaneous follow up work to do.  Illinois development.  I'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power plant sites in Illinois.  Enron/Peoples joint venture.  I'm working with the Enron commercial team in certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running.  This gives at least an overview of what I'm spending most of my time on. . 
 If it says Austin, it must be yours....  Kay 
 Lisa,  Thank you for the timely comments.  Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.  Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make the effective date a current one.  Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since the data sheets have changed.  Hope this was helpful.  Kay      Enron North America Corp. 
 1100 is just fine.  We are all so dependent on our computers, I can hardly remember what we did in the "old days".  Kay 
 so please let me know if you can't get them printed soon.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Mitch,  My suggested changes are highlighted.    Please let me know what else I can do.  Kay

 Hi John,  Thanks for your call the other day.  The team is currently focused on getting the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.  Also, we have had some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the equipment.  I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.  It may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.  The next big item will be the project development agreement.  The tax credit monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.  Again, thanks for checking  in.  Kay 
 Here's how it is shaping up:  We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation. Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate open.  We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20 consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it. The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.  If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.  We should be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be home on Tuesday.  Kay 
 Hi Peter,  Do you have a new ETA yet?  I need to manage expectations on this end.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Geneva,  The instruction sheet mentions a gift bag.  Do I pick this up at drop off?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Peter,  If I can get the clean version, I'm happy to run a blackline here.  Maybe getting out of your system would help!  Thanks,  Kay 
 Blackline to follow.  Kay 
 No problem. 
 Here's the blacklined version.  Kay 
 Most recent (but not final) Turbopark/GE contract.  More to come...  Kay 
 ABB WestLB agreement.  Kay 
 Print job. 
 Greetings,  I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might find interesting and/or helpful.  You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Thanks! 
 Not today.  Let's get feedback from GE today.  Plus, the document has a lot of formatting glitches and it looks terrible.  Does that work?  Kay 
 Hi Peter,  When do you  think we will have a pretty compared document?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Scott,  Here are letters to Westinghouse, as revised to reflect our comments.    Kay 
 For your reading pleasure... 
 I got lots done Saturday, but I can't remember what!  You know how that goes.  I bought a few Christmas presents, which felt good.  I went to the grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing.  That felt decadent.  We didn't get hit too badly.  Jack ran off during the worst part of the storm, scaring Neil and I horribly.  A  neighbor brought him back.  We are having an electronic fence installed soon, so I hope that will help.  I'm glad Michael got to see Uncle Bob.  He was very impressed that his name was so close to Uncle Bobby's.  I'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week.  Sorry I can't get organized.  Hope you are enjoying better weather today!  Love,  Kay 
 I thought I had sent it out on Friday, but I had just saved it as a draft. Must have been the full moon.  Kay 
 Hi Heather, Jeff and Ozzie,  The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are "extremely quiet".  At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a facility is to their house.  You may have determined that the noise level will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not reflect the expected noise level.  Kay 
 Need a sitter.  I'm working on it!  Any idea what time it starts?  Kay 
 A que hora?  (what time?) 
 Looks like they have a rats nest to figure out.  ckm 
 Your suggestion is probably cheaper for Enron! 
 FYI. 
 Ok, I'm almost done forwarding emails. 
 Hi Juan,  Some strange things happened when I restarted my computer.  This little screen came up, saying "installation aborted".  I chose ok, which was my only option.  I'm obviously on it now, so we'll see how it goes.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Heather,  I think the clean one is ok to send to Bob Wright as is.  Kay 
 My recollection is that I gave it to Sheila around the time it came in, but I wouldn't swear to it.  I'll check around here.  Kay 
 Peter,  Do we have a good clean copy?  If so, please re-send it to me, along with the best of blacklines.  I have so many versions that I want to be clear that we are looking at the same documents.  I also want to send the best of the best to GE, the Enron commercial team and the 4 other Enron lawyers who have received the defective versions.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Here's the blackline I prepared, so you can see which looks better.    Here it is as a Word file, just in case: 
 Hi Kent,  Hope this is helpful.  Kay 
 Hey Suz,  Is Sheila still planning on having the GE call tomorrow?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Don,  I'm not connecting this with anything on my "to do" list.  Were you looking for someone else?  Kay 
 fyi 
 Gentlemen,  Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I know it is short, but I thrive on lists.  I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues for that document as well.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI. 
 Mike,  I've been trying to figure out what is meant by the last sentence. Can you (or Dave) clarify what is wanted?  Does it mean that payments must be current for the guaranty, etc, to be acceptable?  Thanks,  Kay 
 okey dokey 
 fyi 
 Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone.  Here are the issues which need to be addressed to keep things moving:  1. Which transformers go where?  2. How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?  3. ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the contract allows for them to request payment security.  Unless they are convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment security.  The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except retainage) to facilitate the assignment.  Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break out contracts closed. I'm available any time.  Kay 
 Are you going to get a Palm Pilot? 
 Paul/Peter,  Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments from the text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version against the original master contract.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Here's something to look at.    I'm heading out soon for Master Whalley's birthday party at the Houstonian, but I'll check messages later today.  Kay 
 fyi.  I'm pr
