 Could you email me the list of issues you have encountered thus far.  Ben really wants me to check with you. (I'm so proud!!)  Kay 
 Both of these are capitalized terms in rev 23.  Is there a difference?  Load Projection Model is in definitions, but Load Forecasting Model is used quite a bit.  ckm

 Hi Nancy,  I am planning to make the changes which arose out of our meeting with VEPCO. When we met with them, we agreed that we would accept all the changes in this draft, then blackline against it.  I tried to do this to this document, then realized that this is a compared document as opposed to a draft marked with changes.  Can you email me unmarked version which contains all these changes, and I'll start from there.  I apologize if I already have the clean draft, but I want to be certain that I am working from the correct version.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes, however, I could use an electronic version if one is readily available (I have the PDF).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Anytime which works for you is fine, as this is more important than my other meeting. 
 Chris,  The docs you sent me that I asked about are titled: Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Midway Grove, and Articles of Incorporation of Midway Grove Property Owners Association, Inc.  I'm a bit unclear as to how the attached relate to those docs, but I must confess to having not read all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email.  It would help if you could connect the dots for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 for calendar, especially 930 
 How's Glenn doing with my binder?  Lots of Midway activity this week.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Quien es mas macho? 
 Hi Doug,  I hear you are working on the Midway deal.  Me, too.   I want to go back to the restaurant  you suggested with the remarkable decor and wine list (was it Burns, something like that?).  I look forward to working with you on this one.  Kay 
 Muchas gracias! 
 Wanna come up? 
 Allyson,  Thank you for your prompt response.  Can you describe the process and timing for filing a project update?  Thanks,  Kay 
 200 is late enough for anyone to be out.  I'm all for the limo taking people home at that time.  I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.  Are you taking Friday off?  Kay 
 If it were me I'd go for the standard limo, mostly because I've never seen the other kind. 
 I'm desperate.  HELP!!!!!!  We have a meeting with Duran et al today, and I really wanted to brouse through this before then.

 I'm not doing a good job of time management, so yoga is looking doubtful. 
 fyi 
 I would like a copy of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Site Plan Approvals, please. Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.  I just wanted some extra quiet time. 
 Here are my initial comments:  There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.  Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing.  Kay 
 How do I get on the list for the form?  Could you pretty please check for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.  We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.  I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?  I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.  I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just in case you are sending anyone else's today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes, because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking. 
 So where are you kayaking this weekend?  ckm 
 I would mention Carlos in the email, or have it shown as sent by him.  If it were me (and not him), I would have you send it under your own name, but explain that you are helping Carlos. 
 Thanks, but I'm throwing away junk all weekend.  Neil will be gone.... 
 Maybe it is on the development phone list.  I don't have it at hand. 
 I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last name?  That would be cool.  I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!  ckm 
 I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive commercial direction.  Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough.  Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff?  Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to combine the two at once, given the short timeframe?  Has Dave signed the extension, by the way?  Kay 
 The agreement and notice are fine with Enron.  Kay 
 Absolutely.  Morning is better for me, as I have a meeting at 230 this afternoon.  I spent some time with Rose and Humberto yesterday, discussing the logistics and options in connection with this and City of Austin.  Kay 
 It should be signed and on its way.  I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a chance to send me the preamble stuff?  I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/  Thanks,  Kay 
 That reminds me.  There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such things.  I don't remember where it is - PR?  I wonder who would know? 
 How cool is that. 
 I can't locate the electronic version of Costs that David prepared.  Can you resend it to me? 
 What about this?  Is this the QSE defn?  =01&Scheduling Entity=018 means an entity contemplated to be recognized by = SPP, and=20 fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmissi= on=20 of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities. 
 Thanks. 
 That means it is recognized, not  "contemplated to be recognized", then?  I= s=20 there such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just schedu= le=20 on their behalf? 
 Please fill in the blank: =01&First Contingency Transmission Outage=018 means

 Hi Kathy,  I'm in the office today, if you want to finish up ABB.  Ben Jacoby and Jody Pierce will need copies, if you will be making copies for distribution.  We can talk about the LM6000 change order #2, also.  Thanks,  Kay 
 yes, thanks 
 Yes, I'm officially in Elizabeth's group.  I need to ask her for a flat screen monitor. 
 I just like to make Margie work.  So do you think they'll fire Dierker?  I guess you heard Lima is heading to the bullpen. 
 You know ES doesn't work Fridays, so that takes away one day of opportunity to approve them, plus she hasn't had an assistant.  Maybe things will improve.  She is very excited about her new assistant. 
 Here's where I am.  I haven't finished all of your changes.  Please look for bold stuff, that's where I have questions.  If no question is given, I'm looking for your confirmation. 
 Good afternoon,  I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal.  Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have sent this out without the usual internal review.  We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 YIPPEEE 
 Have I signed this yet? 
 Hi Greg,  I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option payment credited to the purchase price of the land.  As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.  Hope you get email!  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on certain tasks.  Here goes:  Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.  Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's review.  Here's the draft:  Gregg and I need to review it.  Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list. Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing the task.  Here it is:   Policies - Gregg "Policy Man" Penman has been working on a credit policy, cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of others I'm forgetting.  Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) has a form of credit facility we should use.  Miscellaneous: Decide about services agreement Confidentiality agreements Transfer pricing documentation Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master) Board resolution appointing officers/managers Budget and marketing plan Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)  Hope this is helpful.  Kay 
 Hello.  The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any desired changes.  Thank you,  Kay    PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability to do so. 
 Hi there.  Is the site plan approval a different document than the development order?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please calendar for me. 
 I give up.  How in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion? 
 hey, you're on vacation.  NO WORKING 
 I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, which should help expedite matters.  Kay 
 Steve,  Merchant Energy Ventures doesn't have auditable financials, but NorthWestern Corporation will give GE a corporate guaranty for MEV. Let me know if you run into difficulty verifying their financial status, as I'm sure we can get you something. In addition, Enron North America will have the responsibility to make the future payments to GE as these payment obligations exist as of the closing.  Kay

 okey dokey.  I'd let Marissa mess with sending it out.  Kay 
 Hi there,  Could you please print these for me?  Thanks.  FYI: I'm going to antitrust training from 230 to 430.  Bet you are jealous.  Kay 
 Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if he objected.  John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.  Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I haven't heard anything from David or Scott.  Have you heard anything from Marvin or Bob?  Is there a meeting confirmed for Monday?  I'm on another conference call re landfill.  Yikes.  Kay 
 Elizabeth,  I would like to have a flat screen monitor, if possible.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Well, let's try someplace else.  What can you think of in walking distance? It is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group.  Kay 
 attachment contains overview 
 Ben,  I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we didn't do it with the turbine stuff)  Kay 
 You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?  I'm not asking him to do anything on the LOI.  I haven't spoken to him in person.  I'll address it when we connect.  Are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me?  Kay 
 I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it. 
 FYI.  Please read. 
 I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John can clear conflicts. 
 Attached is a recent version of the VEPCO PPA, which is currently be revised.  Hope it is helpful.  Kay 
 I can't open the form, but I'm good for $50.  Is this something Enron can match? 
 Enron is trying to buy some GE turbines to use in projects. 
 FYI and Ken's review (no offense, John). 
 Good luck! 
 Hi Billy,  Can you take a look at this since the Hermanator is out?  Thanks,  Kay 
 As requested, here is the current draft of the Midway LOI.  The counter party has not seen this draft yet, so this is still preliminary.  I'm reviewing the term sheet re toll.     Kay 
 David,  Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?  I haven't heard the final word.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  John Keffer, Bill Parrish and Andy Schifrin need access to Midway on Deal Bench.  Can you handle this for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll work on them over the weekend. 
 if you insist... 
 I haven't heard a word about this deal lately.  This is why I never throw anything away.  Kay 
 Very out of date, but indicative of the current structure.  Stay tuned. 
 Hmm.  Not typical.  Reorg? 
 I hear Oz will be there, too.  How fun! 
 another puzzle piece 
 much grass 
 I vote for you. 
 Any first class upgrades available? 
 Opps. 
 David,  How about 400 this afternoon? I have another call at 230, but it should be over by then.   Kay 
 I'll be there, too. 
 fyi 
 Attached are draft of more of the exhibits for discussion purposes.   See you tomorrow,  Kay 
 I believe I land in Memphis around 930 Central.  I'll try to call in if my= =20 cell works.  Kay 
 I can't find any call in info for the conference call on Monday.  I may  be reachable on 713 304 8716, or maybe someone could leave me a voice mail message at the office if there is a dial in number.  Thanks,  kay 
 Took about  8 months.  A new record. 
 I was in Clarksdale yesterday, and have a dr's appt this am, but will be glad to give you what I have.  In fact, I could use some help with the EEI if the offer is still good.  Maybe you could just talk me through it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Wilson,  We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter? Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?  I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Just a reminder that I have a drs appt this am.  Nothing special, just one very overdue check up.  Kay 
 Very good.  I was in Miss yesterday and have a doctor's appt this am.  I'll call later.  Kay 
 I go back for more tests this afternoon. 
 Thanks for the info.  Rest well. 
 Is this for the escrow or other docs?  I know Citibank does not require a corporate seal.  What BS!  Kathleen is out sick, so it will be a day or two.  Kay 
 Gold Rose today? 
 Nope.  Only the new ones. 
 I can't make the call on Thursday.  I'm not sure that Sheila can either. I'll leave the go/no go Enron vote to Sheila.  Kay 
 Next time you vote for me, please copy me on the email.  Kay 
 I haven't read this yet, so it is not ready to be sent to TECO.  Just wanted to give you a look as soon as possible.  Kay 
 Sometimes John forgets that he is not a lawyer. 
 I'm available for one hour, so long as I can call in from off campus.  I'll need a new cell phone battery first!  My old one finally died a tragic death.  Kay 
 FYI.  As I'm sure you've figured out, this is VEPCO. 
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals. Kathleen would know. 
 For something that doesn't matter, it seems to matter.  I wonder how well the auto approval works when you are backdating something? 
 How much involvement has A & K had on Midway?  I have other counsel engaged for the sale, but this falls into a different category.  Kay 
 Ben,  If Christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement, I ususally don't have outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason. She's the queen of interconnects.  I suppose that after I review it, next stop is Finance/Accounting.  Carlos has given me a couple of comments.  Kay 
 Please advise which comments you are willing to accept (skipping the nits and legal stuff).  One response from the group, please!  Kay 
 It is Father's Day and we will do what you want. If you want to go there, that's great.  I'm happy to tell Tom, his wife and all the world that what we do that weekend is 100% up to you.  It sounds like he has the impression that I'm the hold up.  Kay 
 Got it 
 Wilson,  We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?  I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.  Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?  Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.  Kay 
 Yes,which is what prompted my email this am. I'm looking for a way to simplify the process since closing is less than a week away.  I'm in 825-925; 1000-1230 today.  Kay 
 Hi Ken,  I have two tickets available for Saturday night if you still want them, at $25/each.  Just email me back, and I'll bring the tickets tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print two copies.  On the stuff you had copied for me, please have the copy sent to John Keffer at King & Spalding.  I'll keep the originals.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I should have sent this to you.  Sorry.  Might save time if you got financials from Mike re: NorthWestern Corp.  Kay 
 fyi. =20 
 Amazing that they stayed afloat.  50 year history probably helped that happen.  Kinda sad, though.  I liked those guys. 
 I received a fax in yesterday, so I'll review it.  Kay 
 Billy,  It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it could be immediately prior to that time.  Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed this agreement before she left.   Kay 
 yes  Cant miss those boxes! 
 Awaiting test results.  You know how that goes.  I give you details later.  I may go; I'll let you know. 
 Figures. 
 No, he thinks he is God's gift to contracts. 
 For your review. 
 Sounds good to me.  I'm in EB 3850. 
 Neil,  I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets nothing at school.  She has no independent information on the rest and shouldn't worry about providing that info to them. 
 Sounds like it, but it is in southern Florida. 
 I didn't think you were being difficult. 
 fyi.  One of AE's. 
 GE wants a letter outlining the structure of the deal (at the 10000 ft level), who owns which companies, and who has payment obligations to them. Could you draft a letter to that effect for my review?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Attached is the master gas agreement, ready for  Clarksdale's review.  We haven't had any feedback from Yazoo City.  When can we expect their feedback?  Thanks,  Kay 
 6 months goes by quickly. 
 How polite. 
 Life being what it is, I've received a mark up of the tolling term sheet, which crossed in the mail with the mark up you sent.  Kay 
 Looks fine to me.  Will you accept the changes and send out?  I would like to receive a  bcc of whatever goes out, if possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  I want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being provided by Piper Rudnick, so that there won't be any surprises when the bill comes in.  Could you give me a brief outline of their scope?  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Lloyd is a good guy.  He is head of the Services Group.  He probably does other things as well, but that's how I know him.  I can send it to Lloyd if you want.  Kay 
 TECO tolling, with my comments: 
 Could I get a copy of the revised LOI which was sent to TECO?  I want to update my electronic file.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Greg and Ben,  So is it about time to get Lisa, Herman and Rose involved in the PAD stuff?  Kay 
 Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.  I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I might remember the names.  Kay 
 Don't know how I missed this.  Must have put it in my Midway file without looking.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I've answered all their questions, and have suggested to Chris that he ask NorthWestern for audited financials.  Marissa is preparing a letter which briefly outlines the deal, since GE had requested a letter identifying the parties, the payment obligations, etc.  I've given them all this information previously in phone calls and by email, but I think they want something official looking.  Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter.  I don't think they will trade payment for a consent, but I could be wrong. It just isn't enough money, and GE isn't strapped for cash anyway.  I'd want to be careful that we don't trip up on E - Next obligations.  Kay 
 When you ask a question you usually have heard a rumor.  What did you hear? 
 Don't know if I'll participate, but please put on calendar anyway. 
 Here's the Risk Management Policy Gregg has been working on for MEH.  Jeff, I don't know if you have seen this, so I thought I would float it by you.  David, I'm sending it to you so that you can comment about any concerns you might have relating to the LLC agreement.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the Cities?  Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.  Kay 
 I'm working through the "agent for" issue, and thought I would share the info.  I've asked our local counsel for  a bit more direct answer (ie, his opinion).  Kay 
 As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet impact. 
 Why would you ask a question out of the blue? 
 Harlan Murphy started last week.  Nice guy from Dynegy. 
 Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the balance sheet.  Kay 
 I think asking David the question is a good idea.  Kay 
 Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality. 
 I'm no oracle, but there would be no current balance sheet impact. 
 Sheila,  For your information.  ckm 
 David,  Is it possible for MDEA to purchase power from EPMI as an agent for the Cities?  This will obviate the need for any type of security.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Whatcha think? 
 Hi Gerry,  I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.  If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very disruptive of my self-perception.  Ciao,  Kay 
 please calendar. 
 I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?  Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?  Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.  Kay 
 There's nothing special here.  Just cloudy.  I took Roscoe in to get neutered.  Neil just couldn't handle it.  Men are so funny like that.  Now I'm going to run some errands.  I hope the weather gets better for this evening.  They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, and it looks like it is getting better.  Still more of a deal south of here.  Kay 
 Since I'm "off" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND without you, I'm not in much better shape.  You know I've kept all my files on email.  I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of something.  Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing - highly inefficient.  I can't do it here, though.  Kay 
 Shepherd, near San Felipe.  Very close to Peggy's house. Peggy should be there, also. 
 Good news. 
 Gregg,  330ish looks good for both David and me.  If you would like to call me, we can conference in David.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Huh? 
 Being revised currently, but lays out the deal: 
 Sorry to ask, but when do you expect to have a draft of the GE letter?  I need to manage Ben's expectations.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email?  I'm on endless conference calls and need to contact him about a matter.  Thanks,  Kay  PS, not a vacation day 
 Keneally's,   We'll be there by 630. 
 It is Paige's 21st today (YIKES)  I'll be back Monday 
 No news today.  I don't want to know today, as I'm drinking champagne and ignoring the issue,

 Works for me.  We are leaving to check in to the hotel, then back.  I had to cancel manicure/pedicure ( and charged for it)  A hint that a gift certificate for same would work might be appropriate. 
 Plse  have fax delivered home.  Today is the day.  I have been a mom for 21 years.  Can't be true.  Still on conference call.  Ben has been very nice. 
 fyi 
 At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs. 
 Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.  They had Mon/Thurs available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.  Besides, Delmis may be able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on Friday.  Our driver's name is David.  His cell phone is 713 545 4186.  We can call him if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.  He will leave us a sack today.  How's that for cool?  Kay 
 Please compare this new document:    to this old draft, and create a redline:     Thanks,  Kay 
 Both are in VEPCO, names under the Word icon on the email.  I'll try to remember next time. 
 Here's the most recent version of the document formerly known as the PPA:    Kay 
 Stan,  Could you please me send me the electronic file of the executed EPC contracts, including the consolidation agreement?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I got my hair cut - it feels so good to get it cut.  I'm planning on going as scheduled.  Do lots of people go to this? 
 What was I thinking?????? 
 Sounds good.  I'm on a conference call that won't end.  I received your fax and will try to call you this afternoon. 
 Hi Mike,  Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.  I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language. Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the "financial wherewithall" to make the payments. This is a big change from where we were in the last contract.  I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary purposes.  This is in connection with the buy back arrangement.  Can you give me a guesstimate?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Allyson,  Will the certification of necessity be specific to ENA?  I ask this because I suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be involved.  This provides us with the option of selling the equity of the entity developing the project.  Your advise is appreciated.  Kay 
 Damn.  How do I find out what it is if I deleted the STUPID email? 
 When do you leave next week?  Kay 
 fyi 
 Do I have original, initialled documents to which I can add the signature pages?  You may have given this to me already...  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the clean version (no redline) of the most recent draft of the PPA.  I have no idea what happened with the redline, but I'll try to get a decent one done. 
 What can I say?  Here's the tubine torture possibilities as they exist at this point in time. 
 I am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known as the PPA.  This is compared against the August 7 draft.  I am sending it without anyone else reading it (a gutsy and foolhardy move), so it is subject to further Enron review.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This is HILARIOUS!  And so true.  We are doing fine here in the sauna, despite the heat and horrible pollution.  No big news to report, which is good.  Hope all is well with your bunch.  Give Lou a howdy and a hug for me.  Kay 
 Please email the signature version of both documents.  Thank you,  Kay 
 From Bev.  Pretty good stuff. 
 Hi Dutch,  My email did not go through to Jeff or John.  Could you please forward it to them for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I  may be on the road tomorrow (won't know until later), so something early afternoon Friday would be best for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 In speaking with Allyson, she believes we need to have the responses the Public Staff's data request no later than sometime next week.  The Staff wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during the week of August 28th.  Therefore, Allyson suggests that we have a call this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together. Sounds like a good idea.  Please let me know when you are available for the call this week.  I suspect it will take between 30-45 minutes.  Also, please let me know if you have NOT received a copy of the data request, as these should have arrived via company mail.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there, ? When I was at Monday's Astros' game, I thought I heard them say that Enron is sponsoring some type of kid's book drive at next Sunday's game.? I have quite a few gently used kids books I am looking to give away, so I was wondering if I could do it in connection with that program.? I will not be at the game Sunday, and I didn't locate a reference to the program on your website. ? Is there a way for me to donate kids books for whatever program Enron is sponsoring, without going to the game? ? Many thanks! ? Kay Mann 
 Hooray.  If I'm paid up with Hays McConn through the month, I'll continue with it until the end of August.  If we  move Michael to public school and save a $100  on parking, things may start to add up!!!  We could pay for a nice little trip somewhere.... 
 Will you be in Friday?  If so, could you help me remember to pick up my parking card.  I FINALLY got a slot at the Met.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm flying to somewhere (probably DC) tonight, returning on Friday.  Ozzie is making the travel arrangements, so you don't need to do anything.  I'll let you know what else I find out.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Jim,  Per Gregg's request, I am forwarding ABB's wiring instructions.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Kay 
 Virginia Power has raised a question about wanting some type of guaranty or other form of performance security should an Enron LLC sign the contract. What can we propose (or exclude) under the contemplated structure?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Attached for your information/review is the latest draft of the VEPCO contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm headed to Virginia tonight, and should be back Friday am.  Could we push back the conference call to the afternoon?  Heather will have the same travel schedule.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'll keep in touch! 
 My copy printed completely.  Let me see what's up. 
 Thanks for the input.  I'll see what we can figure out. 
 fyi 
 appt is at 430.  i wanted to leave at 345 
 suzanne,  Please resend the August 15 redline to the Virginia Power people on the list I gave you.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You know how Remote Control!!!!!!!  How fun!!! 
 John,  The price includes shipment to the site and installation, but not connection. Therefore, there is no additional freight charge.  Kay 
 fyi 
 NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?  I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.  Kay 
 Kathy,  Could you please accommodate Karen's request?  If you would like, you can just send it to me and I will get it to her.  If you have delivered my original to me I can make make her a copy.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project.  We are currently working on the mechanics relating to that.  It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and I'm currently in meetings where I'm using my hard copy.  How soon do you need it?  Kay 
 I don't know if he has the financing docs. 
 Hi Mike,  In a meeting Friday afternoon with Ben Jacoby, he mentioned that he didnt want the change order signed quite yet. I suspect he wants to review it before it is signed, and he's on vacation this week.  Kay 
 Kathy,  I believe Ben needs to initial the change order, and he's on vacation this week.  Kay

 HELP!  What's my R/C number?    Is it 00406373?  Does that look like an RC?  We need to get an invoice from the travel agency Heather and Ozzie used for my flights last week.  I know the travel agent's name is Julie, but I don't know the details.  The agency is something like Vitol.  I suspect Claudette can give you the telephone number, etc.  I would have gotten a receipt from Continental, but the E ticket machine wasn't working.  I have the rest of the receipts. 
 I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.  It seems that we could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out of their scope under the agreement.  I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve out. I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with industry standards. 
 Just to catch you up a bit...

 Hi Rob,  I think we would prefer if you would route the document back this way, and Sheila or I will send it to the folks at GE.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on O.  It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.  It should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.  Please go search and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.  I started making the changes, but got distracted from the task. Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm scheduled to be here.  Tomorrow and Wednesday are pretty bad, but Thursday and Friday are wide open.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Karen,  Please forward the revisions once you get them.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI. 
 John,  The executed signature page has been faxed per your instructions.  Kay 
 I'm going to miss you really badly. Are you sure you want to go to the cool air, unwind, sip wine and eat delicious food?  And miss all this??????? 
 I shouldn't have looked at that when I'm so hungry.  What an incredible menu - and in a relatively small town.  You better take a wad of fatburners!!! 
 Just being out of this nasty smog will be great.  Plus, I bet it is nice there when the sun goes down.  What a great time of year to make that trip.  Can you hear my heavy sighs?  It is time for me to plan something fun, even a short trip.  Planning and looking forward to it is 1/2 the fun. 
 Here's where we stayed on our honeymoon  www.whalewatchinn.com 
 http://www.whalewatchinn.com/ 
 I have an extra I can send you today.  Kay 
 Thursday afternoon would be best for me.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Just a reminder to send me the description you gave the school. 
 Hi Brian,  What a great surprise!  Life is pretty good.  To see a summary, you might want to check out Paige's website: http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/  (I tried to copy that as a link, but I think I messed up.)  I guess Peggy told you (or you figured out from my email address) that I'm working at Enron. I like it.  I enjoy being back downtown after being a suburban lawyer.  Home life is relatively calm, which has always been a goal of mine.  I'm dealing with my folks getting older, with the health problems which come with that process.  Overall, I'm very blessed and happy.  How about you?  If you are spending time at HM, you must still be doing the law thing. I might have lost a bet on that one.  So how's your life?  Paige completed her minor in German.  Consider it a Wunder legacy!  Her brother, Michael is a real charmer.  You would get a huge kick out of him.  Thanks so much for writing.  I can't wait to hear what is going on with you.  Kay 
 Hi Guys,  Is the 501D in storage?  If not, when will it be delivered?  I'm asking in connection with information to be provided in the CPCN process.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Jeff:  Here's a draft for your review:    I suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the intial payment to be made within 7 business days of execution.  That way, we can sign this up next week.  Kay 
 Could we benefit from an internal meeting prior to the call?  Kay 
 We are at the MOU stage.  Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday.  Commercial leads at ENA and Global Finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment.  The information I was given is that we want to get it done by the end of September.  How does this sound?  Kay  PS  Also includes 2 transformers. 
 Heather,  Did you want to send this?  Anything else you want to add? 
 LM's # 1-6, 19-20, plus a couple of ABB transformers. 
 Bill,  I'm attaching an electronic copy of the letter we sent to Westinghouse.  If you email me your fax number, I'll fax you their response.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  Paige is still here.  I think she may leave tomorrow.  Have you ever visited her website?  Here's a link: http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/  You might trying clicking on the link to see if it takes you directly to her web page.  She will have the same email address again this year.  I suspect she will have the same mailing address as well, since it is a box number.  Michael slept well this weekend.  He had a great birthday.  He takes his dinosaur everywhere.  It is so funny, because the button gets pushed accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.  We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.  The smog is horrible.  I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.  Neil and I have a birthday party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again. She should be off of most of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.  We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.  Sammy Sosa hit a home run harder than any I've seen before.  Even some of the Astros fans clapped at the sheer force of it.  The pitcher said he watched it, just because he had never seen such an awesome hit.  Too bad about the heat, but what the heck can you do about it anyway?  Love,  Kay 
 Just a reminder about tomorrow's call.  Enron participants, we will have a conference room on the 38th floor of EB available.  Kay 
 If it didn't come up when you put your cursor on it and click, then you'll have to type in the address in address space when you are on the internet. Or, you can search Paige Record Southwestern University on the web and find it.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.  Thanks,  Kay  Here are the most recent comments from VEPCO:    Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against what we last sent them. 
 Gentlemen:  I have been advised by J. Nassos that Peoples (through WestLB) will be exercising the ABB option today. I have asked that they send me a copy of the notice of exercise of option, and I left Mike Sandridge a voice mail telling him to expect it this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Please make sure Sheila has the host code. thanks 
 yes 
 Sheila said her assistant arranged for one.  Could you check? 
 At least drinks and coffee. Thanks for thinking of it. 
 Hi, my name is Kay, and I'm a Diet Coke addict. 
 Suzanne,  I left the response (which is a letter from Siemens Westinghouse) on the part of my desk which is next to the window.  I MAY have put it in a file folder labeled "Westinghouse".  The letter references a letter we sent to them in the first line.  Please find the letter and fax to Bill.  Thanks a bunch. 
 It would be very helpful if you could participate, or have your designee participate.  Sorry for  the short notice (what else is new). Perhaps we can also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement.  I'm out this am, but will pick up voice mail.  Thanks,  Kay  PS  I can't wait to hear about St. Lucia. 
 fyi 
 I assume that this is in lieu of the meeting we had scheduled for tomorrow afternoon?  Just want to make sure...  Kay 
 I've scheduled the conference room for 2 hours.  We are also looking at Friday am.  Is Friday better for you guys?  Kay 
 Jeff,  I'll focus on the consolidation agreement today.  It seems to me that the time GE has to remit the payment to ENA should remain  3 days.  I don't see a reason to stretch it to  7 days, since it represents a double payment.  Your thoughts?  Looks like the tax issues are completed.  Kay 
 There's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the Westinhouse warranty issues.  It is tomorrow (Thurs) at 1230.  Do you have any interest in sitting in?  Kay 
 What did Heather tell you? 
 Couldn't tell if you saw this... 
 Sounds good so far. 
 This replaces the meeting scheduled for 400 tomorrow. 
 I have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule.  To be honest with you, I'm a bit unclear on who is doing what with this.  Any advice/insight?  Kay 
 The room is 3AC5C1, according to this email.  I didn't check to see what it was before. 
 jeffrey keenan 
 CR [aka conference room] 5C1.  I know they are in the Allen Center.  I'm just damn smart, that's all. 
 You are a BIG HELP. 
 Team Vitro:  I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.  Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms, etc. as the other 2 contracts.  He also provide alternative language which appears to be close to what was in the previous draft. Since I didn't know the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I would check with you first.  I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination. 
 Not finished yet. 
 Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to discuss the VEPCO PPA. The meeting will be held in EB38C1.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Kay 
 Yikes.  Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon tomorrow?  I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.  Otherwise, I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.  You pick a time (the earlier being better for me).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here is the latest version.  Our meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 300 in EB38C1.  Kay 
 Here 'tis, and I'm a yes. 
 I'm going to visit with the Hermanator briefly tomorrow.  Would you like to join me?  Kay 
 Done!  See you then.  I've asked Heather and Jeffrey Keenan to join me.  Kay 
 FYI. 
 I hope to go, at least Friday/Saturday, assuming we have a sitter for Michael, of course.  I met Mrs. Kerekgarto yesterday.  Chris Duerr (duerrc@spring-branch.isd.tenet.edu/).  Maybe you should ask to visit which ever classroom Chris thinks Michael would  be in assuming he started at VO on September 5.  Just a suggestion.  Or maybe you can visit more than one class.  You might want to ask to visit a class during an academic time (as opposed to when the kids are in centers). 
 Here is a rough draft of the Fehr option.  Herman, you will be happy to know that this one is much shorter.  It needs some clean up, but this should be enough to get comments going.   Kay 
 This time I'll include the attachment.  It must be Monday.    Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Just a reminder that until the finance arrangements are fixed and the rules are clear, Enron can't incur any hard costs related to the Virginia Power deal.  This means Enron can't obligate itself to purchase any equipment or materials, or enter into any services agreements except for studies, etc.  I will try to get some clarification on what can be done at this point, and will pass it along as soon as possible.  Kay 
 Hi Jo,  I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you a note as well.  Our son, Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten, which we have decided may not be most suitable for him.  We discussed it with Vivian Shudde, and she suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School.  My husband and I would like to visit Grace.  We are wondering if it might be possible to visit tomorrow.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks,  Kay Mann 
 Don't forget the progress report.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi John,  Looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before.  Thanks,  Kay 
 yes. 
 Jo,  We had some unexpected complications with scheduling today.  We'll have to reschedule.  Thanks for such a prompt reply.  Kay 
 He's doing great today.  He's here with me.  He just attended a meeting with Ozzier, Heather, Herman and Sheila. 
 Sounds good.  Early in the week is better for me. 
 Here's a suggestion for the equipment question:   ENA and its affiliates have contractual rights to numerous turbines, several of which can satisfy the technical and scheduling requirements of this project, and some of which are already manufactured.  In the case of turbines still in the manufacturing process, ENA has firm commitments for delivery, backed by liquidated damages clauses and other financial incentives. 
 Hope this helps.      FYI, if you are doing the deal with EECC or NEPCO, I would just as soon them not see these docs. 
 Hello again,  If these contracts are going to be assigned immediately to Mitsui, isn't the issue of a guaranty a Mitsui issue? Is this addressed in the EPC contracts?  If an Enron entity must give a guaranty, I would think we would want ENA to give it, to be replaced by a Mitsui guaranty unless we have some safeguard against the possibility of paying Mitsui and Mitsui not paying GE, so that we would have to pay twice.  Kay 
 Here are my comments to the draft response:  4.  I'm a bit troubled by the first sentence, since I really don't know what may have been on the drawing board earlier.  Maybe someone else can vouch for this statement. Otherwise, I suggest deleting it.  17.  The reference to NC Power utilizing the plant should be Applicant (third sentence).  18.  I would change the second sentence to begin "It is intended that the plant will be designed, constructed and operated...."  Kay 
 Hi there,  We've had about 15 minutes of rain, I think.  Just enough to keep the mosquitos happy!  Kay 
 That would be great.  Kay Mann 29 Inverness Park Way Houston 77055  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Dina,  Do we have a CA with Teska Associates?  Thanks,  Kay 
 One more CA question.  Pollina Corporate Real Estate?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I believe this draft reflects Herman's comments:    Kay 
 I'll check on the geotech.  What is involved in the site development plan?  Don't give up! There may be a way to get this done.  Kay 
 Hi Gerry,  Enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position. In fact, I work with reformed engineers daily, in various capacities.  Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go through six month rotations in various parts of the business. In addition, there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.  If you see something that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get the inside scoop.  FYI, Enron North America, Enron Broadband, and Enron Energy Services are good choices.  ENA is the old Enron Capital & Trade, so it is the real heart of Enron (yes, it is where I now work).  Enron is also focusing on industrial development (paper, steel, and who knows what else). I don't suggest EECC.  Hope to see you soon,  Kay 
 I'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks (survey work, etc.).  I've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs until the financing/accounting treatment has come together.  That lead to the question of what is a hard cost.  I know construction/equipment obligations are problems, studies generally ok.  This leads me to the conclusion that a geotechnical survey would be ok.  Am I safe here?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Karen,  Both Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf are out of town this week, which means we don't have all the players from Global Finance available.  Humberto (can't remember how to spell his last name) from Global Finance/ENA may be available, and he has participated in similar discussions on two other projects.  At some point he will need to be involved.  The time is fine with me.  Kay 
 Hi Nancy,  This should do it. 
 Hi Matt,  ENA is selling some of the LM6000's to ESA.  Will you be the ENA Tax Man on the deal?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Back at cha! 
 Reagan,  Just to clarify, we intend to assign the land option to Rocky Mount, they buy it and lease the land to us once they own it/annex it/zone it.  Kay 
 Hi Gloria,  Could you please print these for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Just in case you haven't seen a copy, NCNG has filed a petition to intervene in the CPCN proceeding.  The reason stated is that it isn't clear who is providing the natural gas.  It has asked for the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses, to file briefs and argue its position, etc.  Kay 
 Allyson,  Please delete Stuart Zisman and add me to your distribution list.  Thanks,  Kay 
 No problem. 
 fyi 
 fyi 
 FYI. 
 I like this answer. 
 I'm going to have an updated contact list prepared.  Please email me with your telephone, location, email address, and cell phone number, if desired.  Please let me know who should be added to this list.  If you are receiving this vis a cc, I have your information.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's two more to add.  I suggest you put our outside counsel last on the list.  There are two firms: Kilpatrick, Stockton and Bracewell & Patterson. I would put Bracewell before Kilpatrick.  Thanks bunches. 
 Here's the current redline, incorporating most of the comments made last week.  Herman, the language to address your biggest issue is in 2.3, page 7 on the marked version.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 more... 
 For the Bracewell part of the list. 
 Another print job.  Please make me a Wheeling Pitt file folder for these docs as well.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm keeping this one.  Too cool! 
 Isn't it nice to know he is looking out for you?  You can tell how much he cares about you.  Thanks for sharing the stories.  I really enjoy each one of them.  Kay 
 This should be the final (or at least almost final) version.  The amounts are correct. 
 FYI 
 Chris/Ben,  We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan?  Kay 
 Per Ray's request... 
 FYI. 
 I'm far afield of my area of expertise, but Boyd's comments make a great deal of sense to me.  Gregg, did you/will you pass these along to PERC?  Perhaps it would help if Boyd could speak directly to the PERC person with the typewriter, so to speak.  Kay 
 Kevin,  Thank you for your work.  I especially appreciate the memo bringing me up-to-speed.  Kay 
 Here's what I have... 
 Otra mas.  Did I get that right? 
 What issues were invented? 
 Hi Ben,  I've started a draft of the ESA document, and I wanted to get your comments before I go much further.  Basically, I want to make sure  I'm on the right track.    I'll make it look pretty as we go along.  Getting the deal points are most important at this point.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sara,  Maybe a conference call with Gregg would be the most productive way to go.  Kay 
 Feels funny emailing someone so close.  I'm addicted to email, however,  I saw Gregg in the elevator lobby as the door was closing.  I'm going to see if I can corner him while he is in town to see what is going on.  I'm not up-to-speed on this one.  Kay 
 Good morning.  Here is the email you mentioned.  Have a great day!  Love,  Kay 
 I believe I have compared the ENA Aug 29 version to the VEPCO Aug 21 version of the Capacity and Energy Contract.  I'm no expert at CompareRite, but I believe it worked.  Here goes:    Let me know if you have any trouble opening this document.  Kay 
 The details for today's conference call are as follows:  1:30 CDT  Call in number 800 851 1766, participant code 685753  Rose is on vacation and Sheila will be calling in from Portland.  I have a 100 conference call, but I will step out if I can.  Talk to you soon!  Kay 
 Maybe spelling your name right will help this go through.  Sorry! 
 July 31st for Edgecombe.  I didn't prepare the other option, but I'll check to see if there is a copy around.  Kay 
 I'm looking at the Skelton option (Hart County, GA), and can't figure out when it was executed. (must confess I didn't read EVERY word) Can anyone help me with this?  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI.  Is there a conference call scheduled for today, and is Boyd available tomorrow?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Chris,  I would think that we would want to designate which units are affected by the provisions of the change orders, to the extent a the change is specific to certain units.  What do you think about that approach?  Kay 
 I am STILL on my 100 conference call.  I'll catch up on what I missed later.  Kay 
 Glad you wrote, since I need to send you this option agreement for your review:    I will chase down the fax and give it a look.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there.  I have a personal errand to run (nothing bad) Thursday am, so I  won't be in until around lunchtime.  Can't WAIT to hear about your trip.  I hope it was marvelous.  We're looking at a private school for Michael (St.Francis).  I think it is time for a change.  Kay 
 I need to talk to the commercial guy on the deal.  Got a name for me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark up/correct.  Here's how I understand the deal:  People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.  We have presented to People's a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel. Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to $25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.  We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:  Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and covered by our confidentiality agreement. Define term (5 years)  Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting the engineering work kicked off.  We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our methodology.  Please correct/supplement, etc.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I lost the email with the information regarding where to send donations in Gabrielle's honor.  Can you resend it to me?  Thanks. 
 No problem.  Can't wait to see what you get.  I may have to order some more, plus Silly Bob, and the large Klixx, and... oh my gosh, I may be a TOYAHOLIC.... 
 I'm at home this am (kid stuff) but will be in around lunch and all afternoon.  I'll find you.  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I'm looking at it.  Kay 
 I wanted to make sure that everyone is happy with the name Edgecombe Development CO, LLC as the project company name. We are going to amend our petition for the CPCN, and I want to get the name right. 
 I am also a notary. 
 FYI 
 Hi Kay,  I'm looking for CA's with Peoples.  I have one dated December 23, 1998.  Do you have anything else, especially one more current?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Cheryl,  I've been asked to see what I can find out about the status of the generator for the Westinghouse 501D.  I've heard stories ranging from it was on the Titantic, to it was in a rain storm.  Can you shed any light on its status?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is everyone available on Friday to discuss where we are and where we are headed with the CPCN process? We need to discuss whether the petition can/should be amended to allow for a broader certificate.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I never got the email.  Please send it again. 
 Here's a first draft.  It isn't quite done, but I wanted to let you have a look at it ASAP.  Kay 
 For comment, etc.  Thanks,  Kay 
 A little light reading.  Another will follow. 
 I am absolutely delighted.  Kay 
 Laura,  Here's a draft for your review.  If you find it acceptable, it should be ready to go to Peoples as a draft.  Please let  me know if you have any comments.  Kay 
 Hi Rusty,  Just checking to make sure you got this email.  Kay 
 This needs to be added to the Vepco contact list which Gloria started. Thanks, Kay 
 Here it is. 
 FYI 
 It is OURS, all OURS.  So what's the whopping balance now?  Kay 
 As promised... 
 Suz,  Please cancel the 930/Wednesday conference call, as we are changing the time.  Please confirm with Sheila what time we will have the call this week.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gregg Penman was ready, but I couldn't get David Tucker at Bracewell.  Did he forget?  Thanks,  Kay 
 We had a wonderful, quiet weekend. The wine was very good.  I drank it without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.  It would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.  How do I find out how much vacation I have?  I know there's a system on the intranet.  I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.  I know how difficult it can get the longer I wait.  Thursday I won't be in until around noon. More Michael stuff.  Kay 
 I just spoke to Sheila and she told me 130 Central, on Wednesdays. 
 That's it for now.  Kay 
 For your reading pleasure, I'm sending a copy of the infamous 97-10.    Kay 
 Hi Nancy,  I need to bring you up-to-speed on where we are, and share some comments from Virginia Power.  Please let me know a good time to visit.  Thanks,  Kay 
 For future reference, Brian Barto does not participate in these calls.  No need to retract the invite at this point.  Kay 
 GE form contract, 1 1/2 hours. 
 I'm going to be on this conference call (the David Tucker call) for a long time.  Would you mind getting me a Diet Coke?  I have the money in here, but I can't leave my desk.  I should have thought ahead.  Thanks!!!!!!  Kay 
 Hello again,  Makes sense to me.  I would add "on behalf of MEH" after "Transaction" on the first line of the second paragraph of VII.  I don't have the MEH Operating Agreement.  Do you have an electronic copy of it?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is he availabe tomorrow?  Once you get a picture of availability (maybe you have it all ready), ask Sheila what she wants to do. She may want to re-schedule for tomorrow morning.  Kay 
 Thanks.  And thanks for the drink. 
 That's it, just HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  Hope no one is picking on you too badly today.  Kay 
 Hi Ben,  Hope Day 1 of your daughter's illustrious academic career went well.  We are hoping to meet tomorrow at 130 Central in 38C2 to discuss GE issues. Sheila says you won't be here quite that soon, but it would be very helpful if you could join us once you get here.  Time permitting, we can discuss the ESA transaction once we are done with the GE stuff.  See you soon,  Kay 
 We have scheduled a meeting to address the status of our discussions with GE, and develop an organized approach to some issues.  The meeting will be held at 130 in EB 38C2.  See you then,  Kay 
 FYI. 
 FYI. 
 Not dead yet.  Ozzie and Heather are looking at some other possibilities. They don't want to lose momentum until it is clear that there aren't other viable alternatives.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 If these are men's sizes, I'm a small.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Fred,  My understanding (which I will verify) is that Enron would still be at risk from an environmental standpoint with a lease.  We could try to lessen our exposure as much as possible with the lease, and get indemnity from PGL.  Kay 
 Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM    ?Mail this article to a friend  By James Covert Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. "Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation," Skilling said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is "absolutely not" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired "peaking plants," which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, Skilling said. Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. "The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe," Skilling said. "The market there is more fractional, and that creates more opportunities for someone who's playing across the board." Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. "We are not interested in building base-load plants," Skilling said, referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities around the clock. "Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated commodity," Skilling said. "But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape of the market of that commodity." Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on any one geographic region as opposed to others. "There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's possible," Skilling said. "There are just too many variables to approach markets like that." -By James Covert, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; james.covert@dowjones.com Quote for referenced ticker symbols: ENE  , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 I'm ready for another trip to Chicago, to work on the details, the transfer pricing, the Manlove monetization, etc.  Would a day next week be good?  It would probably be helpful if Laura had some availability as well. Tuesday is bad for me, but Wednesday or Thursday looks good.  I'll look over the list and give you a call after lunch.  Kay 
 If anyone asks, I would prefer to have Gloria for our temp.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please hang on to this for future reference.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  It looks good for tomorrow.  I prefer not to schedule anything later than 300, if possible, just to give myself a chance to handle the end of the week details/crises.   Kay 
 Hi Bob,  Does this have anything to do with the Wisconsin site you mentioned in the staff meeting?  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI.  I'm talking to Gregg on the phone now.  Kay 
 I saw something on the intranet which says you can check all your benefits, etc , including vacation time.  It called for a password.  Did you receive a password for yours?  I wonder if it is the same as the password when you submit benefits.  Any ideas?  ckm 
 I wasn't sure if you got a copy of this.  Kay 
 Laura,  Here's the revised version:    Here's a compared version so you will know what I did:    I'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will have something to discuss.  I'm planning on being in Chicago on Thursday if you would like to discuss any of these matters.  Kay 
 Per your request. 
 Ok. 
 Ben,  Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA. One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle back with Lisa.  A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't been addressed with GE.  I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.  I look forward to your comments.  Kay 
 I'm reading it now. 
 David,  Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the prior drafts.  I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and accept the transaction.  In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".  In (y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc]  Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...;  3.3  Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the redlined section on refunds.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's what's hot, what's not:  Virginia Power - don't know how hot it is.  We should know more on Monday.  Chicago - just finished commenting on the Hub Agency agreement.  I would like to visit there next week. As you know, the Manlove monetization is still on the list.  Laura sent me her comments to the LOI yesterday - relatively mild, so the LOI should be going to Peoples in the near future.  You have the list that Gregg prepared on commercial/legal to do's, and he and I will work on those things next week.  LM stuff.  General consulting business; form 97-10 EPC for affiliate, form GE contract (drafted by AK) on the list.  ESA/ENA turbine sale.  Sent Ben a draft MOU.  Not a time hog.  Miscellaneous development stuff - land options, etc, for Fred and Rusty.  Not very time consuming.  Opps, I'm late for a meeting!  I can give you whatever details you need.  All things considered, I'm in pretty good shape.  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  I will try to take this one it.  There is a charge for it (I think) that the department picks up.  By the way, have you been invited to the ENA law conference at the Woodlands?  We need to get you in on that one.  Talk to you soon.  Kay 
 Great idea.  By the way, do you know if Kathleen has been included in the law conference stuff?  Kay 
 Today is kind of bleak.  Tuesday is good should something change for you.  Kay 
 Hi Richard,  I'm working on a form EPC contract.  Do you have a favorite arbitration clause you would suggest be included?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks.  I suspect I'll be in the loop on this one way or the other.  Do you want me to send you emails so you know what's up?  Kay 
 Do you want to keep up with this, or pretend you never heard of Chicago? 
 Here's what I know about this deal so far. 
 Please print, place in folder (surprise, not a binder!) labeled CRRA Fuel Cell Agreements.  Thanks!! 
 Thank you for this info.  Sounds like this is getting a fair amount of attention in the region.  I have your name written on a piece of paper.  Do I owe you a call?  Kay 
 small green pressboard like you order for me 
 Hi Nancy,  We are getting geared up to look at the interconnection agreement and work on the land lease.  Just thought you might want to put it on the list of fun things to do in the future.  Kay 
 Sorry Reagan, I just opened this email.  Kay 
 FYI.  We had a conference call this am.  I'll catch you up later.  Kay

 Who is authorized to sign on behalf of this company?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Just in case I forget to mention it, I need to move our SF visit to Friday am, due to travel plans.  Is this still ok with you?  Kay 
 I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  Here are the issues I see:  Indemnity issues: They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors. Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence. What is a cognizant government?  Limit of liability issues: They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price. They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible. They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Comments?  Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Kay   They should have to 
 Hi Allyson,  What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office (or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the confidential information we file?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Calif Pwr Woes Tuesday, September 12, 2000 08:15 AM    ?Mail this article to a friend  (This article was originally published Monday) WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday. The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel. "If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, we will do so," Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring "as some have alleged," he added, "we will respond accordingly, by revoking market-based rates or otherwise." However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under the Federal Power Act. "The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities," Hoecker testified. The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers "until we have a record supporting such action," he said, referring to the results of the pending staff investigation. Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base. Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago. State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price controls don't apply. FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange. Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market volatility. And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the power-supply problem. FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were "less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate," Hoecker noted. Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, "the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets," he said. "Large regional markets can be made to work effectively," Hoecker told the lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example. Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market structure. By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news, msgs). California's market structure "placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers," Reliant's John Stout testified. "San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumer's Action Network. Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets. "California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last," said Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president. "Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market," said Edwin Guiles, Sempra's president of regulated operations. "This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem," said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing. "We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace," Bilbray said. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-6647, bryan.lee@dowjones.com Quote for referenced ticker symbols: EIX, ENE, PCG, REI, SRE  , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 Can the gas company also make the same requests? 
 Hi there.  I changed our SF appointment to 900 on Friday.  We have not been successful in getting a hotel room anywhere close to where we are going.  There is some big fashion convention in NY, and the rooms are booked as far away as Danbury, Connecticut.  Wild, isn't it?  Heather says there is a chance that we will fly out tomorrow, spend tomorrow night in NY, then I can fly to Chicago Thursday am.  I still plan on flying back on Thursday pm so that I can make that 900 appointment.  That may mean taking the midnight flight, but what the heck.  I'll keep you posted.  Kay 
 I won't be in Friday am, as I have a 900 appointment out of the office (another school visit - I hope we are almost done).  I don't know my travel plans yet.  I may ( or may not) be leaving today.  If not, I will be leaving tomorrow.  I don't need you to make any arrangements yet.  Kay 
 Please note. 
 Allyson,  What is the proceedure for objecting to a request (either the intervenor's or the Public Staff's)?  Is our position weakened in resisting an intervenor's request if we have given the same information to the Public Staff?  Thanks again,  Kay 
 I guess you are having some kinda fun over there, hitting the forward button.  Actually, I appreciate the info. 
 Gentlemen,  I have made changes to the consolidation agreement, which I hope all will find acceptable:    (It does need a date or two.)  As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:    Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?  I would suggest that we make the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the contracts immediately.  That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if necessary.  If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.  Sorry I missed your call.  It was a day of meetings.  I will be on the road tomorrow, but will check my voice mail.  Kay 
 It currently appears that I will be on the road Wednesday and Thursday. Figures!  I am going to send you a copy of the marked up interconnection agreement, which has comments from various Enron people. I thought it might help you think about which way to head.  I would appreciate receiving an electronic file of the IC you prepared.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Is there a time limit for lodging an objection? 
 Here's a draft.  More names are being added, so feel free to suggest more that we forgot/overlooked, including those external to Enron.  Please send the info directly to Suzanne Adams.  Lisa, Mitch and Chris, you will be on the next draft.  Sorry for the oversight this time around.  Thank you,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Please add Lisa Bills, Chris Herron and Mitch Robinson.  You have Lisa's info on the GE list.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This is the VEPCO contact list, as far as I know.  Do we have another one? (opps!) This is the one Gloria did while you were on holiday in the West. (Doesn't that sound good?)  Kay 
 Hi Neil,  Looks like I'm headed to the Big Apple today, then Chicago tomorrow, back on Thursday.  I'll fill you in on the details when I have them.  Love,  Kay 
 Please add this name to the Virginia Power part of the list. 
 Please check with Mike Barnas,Kent Shoemaker (GE contact list) and Rose Engeldorf and see if they are available at either 1100 Central tomorrow or 100 Central.  If that works for them, please reschedule the conference call, send a confirming email to Mike, Steve Swift, Kent, Marty, Scott, Rose, Sheila (and leave her a voice mail -she is on the road), etc.  Thanks!  Kay  PS.  I have a 330 flight today- Heather arranged.  I'll let you know the details when I have them.  I'll travel to Chicago tomorrow, returning to Houston tomorrow at a decent hour. 
 I'm either losing my mind or my email.  Did you send me an email re GE?  I thought I saw one, but now I can't find it. Is that a trick, and if so, how do I do it?  Could you resend it, please?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  Here's the notice we discussed.  Kay 
 Ben,  We have a draft of the VEPCO "standard" interconnect, which has been internally reviewed by Mitch Robinson and Christi Nicolay.  Would you like a copy? Nancy Wodka (Bracewell & Patterson, DC office) is outside counsel working on it as well.  We have had no substantive discussions with VEPCO about this agreement at all.  Let me know how you want to proceed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Important question...  Where should I stay in Chicago?  Thanks,  Kay 
 flying to NYC at 330 on CO.  Don't know flight number.  Don't know where I'm staying in NYC.  WED: Fly from Newark to Chicago tomorrow at 645 pm.  Don't know where I'm staying in Chicago.  THURS: Fly from Chicago to Houston, leaving at 200pm, arriving at 428.  That's all I know for now.  Kay 
 Hey Ken,  I'm so sorry.  I'm not trying to hide!  I just found out I have a 300 flight to NYC on a deal I know little about, then on to Chicago, no hotel rooms in either city but GOTTA GO, not sure of the return. In short, I've been Enronized. I picked up your number on a scrap of paper instead of the travel agent's number (different scrap of paper I still have not found), and when you answered I couldn't figure out who I called. At least your email helped me get back to reality.  I apologize for the confusion, for not getting back to you, etc.  Please don't read anything into it other than your glimpse into Enron. My sense is I'd better not commit to anything this week, since I literally don't know whether I am coming or going.  Thanks,  Kay 
 One of them is essential to the call.  If they can't change the time but 130 Central is still ok with them, then leave it as is.  Please leave me a voice mail of the outcome.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Laura,  I'll be in your offices 1st thing Thursday morning.  Is that a good time fo= r=20 you?  Kay 
 Just to complete the picture. 
 fyi.  No hotel in NYC yet... 
 Ben/Mike,  Did you guys work out anything on the 12th slot?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Julie,  Do I have seat assignments on the last two legs?  Many thanks,  Kay 
 Laura,  Here is a draft transfer price agreement:    I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a beginning point.  I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft. We can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any additions, etc, you think are necessary.  I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a change.  My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile. I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.  Kay 
 I'm walking into the lion's den on Thursday (a/k/a Chicago) to discuss various matters.  I know Laura is anxious to move forward on the Manlove deal.  I thought it might be really neat if we (Legal) could have a game plan for this deal, described by Laura as being "like the Bammel deal".  If I can get Laura to commit to a time, how about a conference call to discuss where to go with this?  I'm taking the long way to Chicago (via Connecticut), but will be checking voice mail, etc.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hello from Chicago.  I'm in Enron's offices, so I can pick up email.  Once I figure out what is going on with the ENA Legal reorganization, I should be able to figure out who to ask about hiring needs.  Then we should talk about how to get John into the program.  Maybe EECC has too many lawyers now.  How ironic, considering how busy we were this time last year. Things change!  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Hey there.  I don't think I've been fishing since July.  Geez, it is half way through September.  I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).  A whirl wind tour.  I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.  Two weeks later the owner died.  We need to find a "new" dive.  Kay 
 I gave Ben a very preliminary draft recently, then I left town (I'm in Chicago today, NYC yesterday).  I want to make sure I've addressed his concerns before drafts start floating around.  He and I are trying to get coordinated so that we can widen the circle a bit.  Hope this answers your questions.  Kay 
 Sheila,  Just want you to know that I am thinking of you as I amuse myself, waiting for my meeting to begin.  Kay 
 Sounds good to me.  Next week, that is, not St. Louis. 
 I should be in the office after 1100 on Friday.  Are you available?  Kay 
 Could you please email me the names of the officers of Enrow MW, LLC?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I thought I recalled you suggesting that changes we used on the LM 6000 deal be incorporated into a "master".  Maybe I misunderstood (not the first time!!!) 
 You are my hero.... 
 Revised draft.  Da Bulls toner is low, so the draft doesn't look good, and I don't know where the others print.  Guess I could just listen for it... 
 Let me clarify.  She sold the place when the city put in bike lanes because it screwed up the parking.  I've heard wonderful, divey things about the Roll-in.   A top prospect. 
 The real deal: 
 Deb,  Could you please check with the state of incorporation (I believe Delaware) and the Corp Secretary's office to see if the papers have been processed in both places?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi guys,  Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, destined to be 97 10 compliant?  I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's standpoint.  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi  Kay 
 Scott,  I'll give you what we got from FCE when we meet at 300.  Remind me if I forget!  Kay 
 For your information. 
 Christi,  I'm so glad you wrote, not just because the information is so important, but also because I've been meaning to return your call.  I look forward to working with you on this and other issues. I'm sure I'll be calling with questions soon.  Kay 
 Hi Sheila,  When you have a moment (ha ha) could I get a copy of a couple of power project risk memos?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Today is not a good day for me to go out after work.  I'm planning on picking up my sweetie (Michael) from school, since I've been out of town.  I would vote for the Roll-in.  No question.  I would buy just to see Keffer there.  Kay 
 Can you tell if the documents have been filed in the state of incorporation?  Could you send me an email with a description of what you learned about how this done?  I know the procedures weren't followed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is John there?  What do you want to do this weekend?  Should I thaw sausage for tonight?  ckm 
 How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?  I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.  Details to follow...  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please see if you can get a conference room, allowing 2 hours for the meeting.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I should mention 900am as the time!    Enron North America Corp. 
 Russell,  I don't believe we intend to qualify in all of those states.  Kay 
 FYI 
 Please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank.  I will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there.  Hope you've had a great weekend.  The weather was PERFECT!!!!  Kay 
 Hi Reagan,  Is a conference room available on 29?  We are having a hard time finding a meeting place.  Thanks,  Kay 
 What could be better than a meeting on an interconnection agreement?  I know I need to organize another turn of the C&E agreement.  I'm going to give it a look and see what open issues we might have.  Kay  PS  Isn't the weather perfect?  I thought of our friends in VA and NC with the hurricane remnants headed their way.  Hope it isn't too bad. 
 If I show, it will be only to lend support to those with real input, AND to show legal department solidarity (ie, avoid later lawyer shopping).  Thanks for the info.  Kay 
 Please calendar.  Also, Thursday is my mom's birthday, so I need to remember to shop for her at lunch tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Sheila,  Shall we try to get the Enron groups together to discuss the approach we want to take with GE in our next phone call?  If so, please advise of any time you have available on Monday, and I'll get it set up.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Just want you to know that I should be getting an EPC  form to work on from EECC re 9710. I didn't get to discuss this with J. Schwartzenburg on Friday, since I didn't see him for after work on Friday.  I opted to see Michael instead since I had been out of town.  I've got the form break out contract for the LM 6000's.  I'll get it ready for you to review re the ESA deal.  It will probably take me a few days to get it in shape to let it go.  Hope you've had a great weekend.  I don't  think the weather could have been better.  Kay 
 fyi 
 I'm trying to avoid a two elevator ride, if possible.  God forbid I should take the stairs!  I'll let you know what he comes up with, if anything.  Kay 
 I haven't opened the attachment yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap. 
 FYI, Reagan is a man, a developer in Ben Jacoby's group.  I checked the paper for an obit about Don.  Was there one?  How was his mother?  Are you going to Jillian's on Thursday?  Can't wait to see pics.  I'll be by soon.  Kay 
 Power Assets is currently Sheila's group, pre-reorg. 
 http://www.ots.enron.com/~legal/ADDRESS.HTM 
 Long conference calls make me happy about having email.  Do you want Brian/Lisa/anyone else commercial?  Kay 
 How about meeting in advance of tomorrow's 130 phone call to discuss the approach we want to take with GE?  I'm suggesting 400 this afternoon.  Please let me know how this works for you.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I should have included you also.  Are you available?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Lisa,  I inadvertently left you off the list.  Hope you can come.  Kay 
 Lisa Bills and Brian Barto are also invited.  I haven't heard from anyone yet.  Please call the list around 200 to see if people are available.  Also, can you find a conference room?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Karen,  I'm looking at a version which was faxed on Sept 13.  If this the final version?  Expecting the answer to be "yes", I am reviewing it now.  Kay 
 I suppose a location would help! Location TBD, I'll make sure you get a call.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 This is the most current information I have on specifications.  I sent Ben and Mike an email about the 12th slot, but haven't heard from either one of them.  By the way, I was asking about whether the changes I had suggested for the transformer contract had been included in the Calumet equipment purchase terms, as I was confident the changes are in this agreement.  Kay 
 I can come! 
 I'm looking at it right now.  Could you please email it to me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 My understanding is that Illinois is the only one, unless enovate will have employees or inventory in any other states.  It is my understanding that it will not.  Gregg, Russell, Matt, please speak up if I'm missing something.  Kay 
 I'm going to work really hard this week to see if I can catch up a bit, and take a day off soon. 
 No surprises with CW.  She's very nice to me, but she does like to keep very specific hours.  I get the impression that leaving 15 minutes past 5 really bothers her.  Just watch, and see. 
 Karen,  I don't run across many people without email these days. Big hassle.  It is so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy.  I'm looking for the Fehr option, but the latest I have on my computer is the version I emailed to you on August 30th.  Is there a more up-to-date version, and if so, could you please mail it to me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 This makes me crazy.  I ask her to send me a document, and she copies TWO partners on the transmittal, plus Fred and Rusty. 
 Good.  I feel better.  I just don't think we owe them enough yet. 
 It is mainly a tax issue (whether we have to pay franchise tax), and ENA Tax says we don't need to register.  At least that's how I understood it.  I'll double check.  We can do the name change and register later.  That's no problem.  Kay 
 Here's the attachment. 
 Here are my observations:  I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second, there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement. We'll need to run this back through Accounting.  I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.  I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this parcel.  Kay 
 Due to a last minute conflict, we need to reschedule this meeting.  How does everybody look for Wednesday?  Sorry for any inconvenience.  Kay 
 Karen,  Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects Rusty's suggestion. Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.  Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to meet their request.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Viola 
 As soon as I get a redline, I'll get it to Accounting and we can go forward quickly.  I will also process the Virgil and Joan Ledford deal at the same time.  I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow, which will help.  Kay 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.  Ozzie had to leave town, and he wanted to participate in the first meeting. I'm sure we will get something worked out.  Kay 
 Allyson,  Here is a very recent version of the PPA:    Kay 
 Hi Sara,  I believe we still have an interest in using an Enron form as a go by for the Enron/Peoples activities.  If you can give me what you are comfortable with, I will make sure it is transmitted with the appropriate caveats, confidentiality restrictions, etc.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here tis.  We'll be turning a new draft to Peoples today or tomorrow, but I figure it needs to go to Allyson now.  Kay 
 Hi Cle,  We need a revolving loan agreement between Midwest (now enovate) and Enron. Please call me at your convenience to discuss (713 345 7566).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Any time is good for me. 
 Hi there,  Any luck with the form to work with on the affilate/epc/97 10 compliant contract?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Allyson,  Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?  I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once again, your assistance is appreciated.  Kay 
 Hi Kay,  I hate to admit this, but I need another copy of whatever confidentiality agreement we have with Virginia Power.  Thanks again,  Kay 
 This may be our best bet. 
 This information is helpful.  Is the draft of the PPA submitted by VEPCO confidential?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Heather,  The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows:  Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the status thereof.  -------------------------------------------------------------  We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss amending this agreement.  Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.  Kay 
 One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore, please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.  I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were submitting as confidential information, specifically including the responses to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the specifics at this point.  Thanks again,  Kay 
 I don't know what I have in mind.  Austin?  Palacios?  I'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a holiday, we have to include your mom, or vice versa.  That just wasn't how it worked in our family growing up - we typically spent holidays with one or the other, rarely with both. I'm trying to figure out the rules.  I haven't heard from St Francis yet.  Kay 
 This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.  As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.  Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our forms allow this.  I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors" whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or effective solution?  Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the issue.  Kay 
 Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:  1. Advantages to the single contract:  Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one. Better from a liability standpoint. Easier to administer.  Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?  2. Repayment/prepayment  I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.  3.  Assignment to Mitsui  Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence. Peggy is checking on this, also.  4. Parent guaranty.  GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if necessary.  Kay 
 Will do. 
 HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth. Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for bandwidth trading and broadband services. Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still basically "an energy and broadband company," he said. While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses. Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary. In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said. In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news, msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made. Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a telecommunications network. Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later. The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of 13 pooling points. Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, facilitating bandwidth trading. Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom carriers. The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company handed out at the conference.

 Hi Guys,  I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine contracts.  Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to Allyson?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gregg,  Sheila was telling me that Enron has an ISDA agreement with Peoples, and there's some guaranty language there, also.  I'll try to track this down.  Kay  ps I've asked Sara for the ISDA agreement.  I'll let you know when I get it. 
 My fax number is 63491.  FYI, I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality provisions of those contracts.  In fact, I would  like to get a copy of the 501 D contract (I have the GE contract).  Do you have a copy of the entire thing?  Thanks,  Kay 
 So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?  Maybe we can track down the rest.  I have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may not be the correct one since the delivery date is last June.  I think ENA needs a complete copy of the contract, including any executed change orders. Do you think someone in your group might have that?  Many thanks,  Kay 
 I think it would be a good idea.  We really need the ENTIRE executed contract, with change orders (opps, said that already), and I only have an electronic copy. 
 No good deed goes unpunished. 
 Hi Karen,  Our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 100, so it would be helpful to get this information as soon as possible.  It would also help if you could send a redline against the version I had sent you, as this was the last draft reviewed by Accounting.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Nancy,  I knew you were thinking about it, so I didn't worry.  I'm monkeying around the PPA, only because I had a meeting with Ozzie and Heather late last night.  Will you be picking up emails in the next day or so?  I can forward you what I've done for your review.  We need to get a Enron/BP dialogue going concerning the lease with the City of Rocky Mount.  When do you want to discuss this (or have us discuss it with the right B & P person)?  Thanks,  Kay 
  Speaking of options.... 
 I don't think I saw that happen. 
 I need to set up a conference call with the outside lawyer who will be drafting the lease (and other docs).  Who would like to participate in the call?  How about Thursday am?  Thanks,  Kay 
 viola 
 Thank you for your response.  It is always refreshing to get good news! 
 I'm at home this am trying to get it finished up.  I just couldn't get 15 clear minutes at the office. 
 Here are my comments:  Revise  "whereas" clauses to make it an option for an easement, not a current grant of an easement.  Should we be able to enter all of Parcel 2 for due diligence, as opposed to just the easement area?  (paragraph 7)  Matt, I wanted you to be aware of paragraph 17.  Kay 
 I'm at home this am, working. 
 Hi Sheila,  I'm happy to take care of this, I just want to make sure I'm not stepping on anyone's toes. Is anyone else working on this?  Kay 
 What do you think of this? (sorry it isn't redlined yet)  (b) Intra-Day Scheduling.

 I called in for the Finance meeting.  I'm trying to finish up an important document and could never get a half hour without interruption.  I should be in after lunch.  Kay 
 I've returned the Staff's phone call, but got voice mail.  It would be helpful to discuss this before I talk to them.  Could we schedule something around noon (or later)?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Now you know why I'm at home. 
 I just checked my messages.  Nothing from SF yet. 
 How close did I get?  10.2 Effect of Force Majeure.  In the event of a Force Majeure event=20 affecting Seller=01,s ability to Deliver Scheduled Energy from the Facility= , the=20 following shall occur: =20 (a) Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable use commercially=20 reasonable efforts to fulfill its obligations to deliver Scheduled Energy= =20 from Market Sources until notice is provided pursuant to Section 10.2(b)=20 below.  do we want to delete this?

 Maybe we give it a couple of hours.  I'm getting nervous, but I tell myself that whatever works out will be for the best. 
 No problem.  I got some comments from Accounting, but I'm fine if you want it to go out with the caveat that Enron has a couple of minor administrative points to clear up.  Kay 
 I know I'm repeating myself...thank you, thank you, thank you.... 
 Hi again,  I accidentally deleted the emails you sent me about Gleason.  Could you resend them?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm working as fast as I can.  Things connect together, so it takes a little while.  I think I'm about done with the hard stuff. 
 Herd cats.  That's what we do.  I've just tightened up FM a little.  I'm trying to make it easy to=20 understand. By the way, we don't suspend O & M, so I guess they still have = to=20 pay it.   10.1 Force Majeure.  If either Party is rendered unable by Force Majeure to= =20 carry out, in whole or part, its obligations under this Agreement and such= =20 Party gives notice and full details of the event to the other Party as soon= =20 as practicable after the occurrence of the event, then during the period of= =20 such Force Majeure but for no longer period, the obligations of the Party= =20 affected by the event (other than the obligation to make payments, other th= an=20 the Demand Charges under the circumstances described in Section 10.2) shall= =20 be suspended to the extent required.  Without limiting the foregoing, any= =20 hours during which Seller is unable to deliver the Scheduled Energy by Buye= r=20 due to an event of Force Majeure shall not be included as hours during whic= h=20 Seller has failed to deliver Energy for the purpose of determining the Forc= ed=20 Outage Rate under Section 4.6. The Party affected by the Force Majeure shal= l=20 remedy the Force Majeure with all reasonable dispatch; provided, however,= =20 that this provision shall not require Seller or Buyer to (i) settle any=20 strikes or other labor disputes or (ii) deliver or receive Energy at points= =20 other than the Delivery Points. 10.2 Effect of Force Majeure.  In the event of a Force Majeure event=20 affecting Seller=01,s ability to Deliver Scheduled Energy from the Facility= , the=20 following shall occur: =20 (a) Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable use commercially=20 reasonable efforts to fulfill its obligations to deliver Scheduled Energy= =20 from Market Sources until notice is provided pursuant to Section 10.2(b)=20 below.

 I still have to fix the liquidated damages/termination stuff, but here's a redline for you to look at.  I picked up the comments from others (Terry, Christi) and these should be lined as well.  I should be done soon. 
 I'm losing it.  GLAD YOU LOOKED!!! 
 I need to provide the NCPUC a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as I can. How long will it take?  Kay 
 I spoke with Bob Henson.  His questions were: ownership of LLC (I'm getting the documents) and status of PPA.  Kay 
 Yikes.  I think I'd still rather be a woman, although now I can't remember why I feel that way. 
 Got anything?  Should have been signed this year.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think the LLC agreement would be a big help.  Thanks! 
 Yes, and please add me, too.  I can't remember if I mentioned that before. 
 John,  Probably safe to assume it is me.  Kay 
 This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at  St. Francis, which may be his new school (so far, so good).  I'll be in around1000  Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, which means leaving by 445 or so.  October 4, ENA orientation in the am.  October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school (leave at 430)  October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.  Neil has a meeting in San Antonio (usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year). It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.  This means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing. Figures, of course.  Thanks for asking.  I'm watching for some good vacation days, also... 
 We are staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, which is nice.  There will be a private party as SeaWorld, which could be fun. They usually do everything first class all the way, since it is the officers shindig.  I get to see some nice people I only see once a year.  Everyone parties hard, too.  Diet time!  I've done ok so far, considering the travel.  This means I've lost the weight I gained when I was on the road every week.  ckm 
 fyi/review/comment 
 I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:  We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.  Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?  Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?  I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.  Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?  I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet).  If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Forget the ONE or more contract questions.  I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project.    Enron North America Corp. 
 On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed.  Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Remarkably clear explanation. 
 Here's a draft letter for CRRA.  I didn't send it to Jeff since he is out today.  Kay 
 Hi Cle,  FYI.  Kay 
 An update... 
 I think you and I may have different documents.  Maybe we should compare.  Thanks,  Kay 
 What time? 
 FYI.  Meeting is at 100 
 Per your request. 
 FYI, no action requested at this time. 
 Being first is overrated.   IS IT TIME YET??? 
 Allyson,  You should receive some formation documents relating to Edgecombe Development.  The name is not spelled correctly (missing an "e"), but that is being corrected at this time.  Bob spoke to me about wanting Enron to send a letter concerning the financing arrangements for the project.  I would like for us to discuss this as well.  Kay 
 This is a comparison to their version.  I think I have a comparison to ours as well.  Kay 
 A comparison to ours.  Kay 
 I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about the tests, etc.  Do you still have it?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I was out of the office on Friday, so I just now heard your voice mail.  I haven't been through all my email, but I haven't seen anything from Stephanie on email.  I do have a hard copy version which is too long to fax with confidence.  I'll give the forms a look, and fax them your way with some type of disclaimer for Peoples benefit.  Kay 
 I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit, mostly regulatory- they are so so.  It is my understanding that the Atlanta office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them. I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office (multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results. I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up with the right folks in Atlanta.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Okey dokey. 
 713 751 3255 
 Wanna go?  Sounds like fun to me.  Michael will love it.  Kay 
 Sounds good to me.  I'll check with Neil.  I know Michael would love it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi John,  Question. Can we agree that a form contract will work for both EECC and NEPCO? Sure would make life easier.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Mike,  Here's a revised version of the option agreement.  I changed the shipping dates, quantity (10), Outside Exercise Date, and the amount of the option payment.  I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work.  Have there been some changes to the data sheets?  It appears to me that there might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.  In the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option.  Please call or email me if you have any questions or comments.  Kay 
 Pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.  Perhaps the sky is not falling. 
 Gentlemen,  I've recently become involved in the "cell sale" side, meaning the transaction to sell the Fuel Cell equipment cells to CRRA.  I've met the Fuel Cell folks, but have not met anyone with CRRA yet.  Currently, I'm preparing a letter of intent for Enron/CRRA for the purchase/sale of the cells, have a development agreement prepared by outside counsel to review, and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for FCE to review. I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he cares to read.  I've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase the equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase), but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.  I would like to chase down that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded, however.  I'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol, as I know Dave is very interested in that aspect of the process.  Kay 
 Per your request.  Kay 
 This is an internal draft, which has not been sent to CRRA, as far as I know.  Kay 
 Here's my suggestion:  27.3   Consequential Losses.  The Parties have agreed to liquidate certain= =20 direct damages and have provided for these damages as Liquidated Damages an= d=20 Cancellation Fees.  For purposes of this Section, Liquidated Damages and=20 Cancellation Fees shall not be deemed consequential losses.

 I have in mind a contract that EECC and NEPCO will agree is the ENA form contract, so that there isn't a need to come up with two different contract forms.  Is that too high of a mountain to climb? 
 I hope this didn't sound flippant, cuz I didn't mean it that way.  Kay 
 This is the one you looked at and left me comments.  Your comments aren't in this draft (timing), but I want to pick them up in the next go round.  When we get together to discuss stuff, maybe we can review this.  It is difficult to get your comments over voice mail, as I'm  just not that quick!  Kay 
 fyi 
 Karen,  Could we have the option of using a letter of credit versus a corporate guaranty? (8) 
 Hi Rusty,  Just wanted to check to see if  you can get me a copy.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Matt, Since so much of this related to tax, I thought you should have a look at it.  Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the information.  Is this something which is going to the public, or to the governmental entity involved?  If there is something which will be distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group bless it.  Kay 
 Hmm. 
 Hi Dan,  One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA. I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.  Kay 
 You made me laugh. 
 How about meeting in Sheila's office (3879) at 1030? 
 Hi Stephanie,  Thanks for the hard copy of the ISDA docs.  Would it be possible to get an electronic version of what you gave me?  Thanks again,  Kay 
 Mark/Karen,  I received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the LOC. The reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing structures, depending on which entities own equity in the LLC at the time of the posting of the security.  Perhaps language such as  "an appropriate payment security" or other similar language can be utilized. Please be assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a corporate guaranty.  The draft responses have been forwarded to the Enron tax department, due to the discussions concerning certain tax issues.  I believe it is appropriate to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released.  Also, I don't believe I fully appreciate the context of these questions and answers, and how and to whom these answers will be given. A brief explanation would be most appreciated.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Here's the latest info I have. 
 Other than that Mrs. Lincoln... 
 Brian,  I'm not sure I understand their objection to the wording about the guaranty. Do you think that there is going to be a problem with them accepting the Mitsui guaranty? I don't know what the arrangements are with Mitsui, and perhaps there isn't a real issue due to how this is being handled in the EPC contracts.  My understanding is that Peggy will be giving legal sign off on these agreements for ENA.  Kay 
 fyi 
 I thought it was an excellent synopsis. 
 63491 
 Has anyone given any thought to the creation of a new company to enter into the CRRA/Fuel Cell purchase/sale transactions?  Any names to suggest?  If Enron is going to be the contractor as contemplated by the PDA, I would expect to use a limited liablity company and not ENA.  Please advise.  Kay 
 I can call you when I get out of my meeting, but it might be awhile.  Or, it might be 600.  Dunno. 
 Que lastima. 
 FYI.  I'll bring you the ONSI confidentiality agreement. 
 Got anything that looks like a confidentiality agreement with a company called ONSI?  Should have been signed this spring.  Thanks.  Kay 
 Hi Sarah,  Thank you so much for your efforts to get this scheduled.  However, it doesn't look today is going to work.  Since spoke earlier this week, Michael has been accepted to private school, where we believe we will move him.  However, we still haven't determined what to do about speech therapy, and would appreciate the benefit of your evaluation and expertise, especially since Michael is eligible to receive services at VO.  Is it possible to schedule a meeting with that in mind?  Thanks again,  Kay 
 FYI, and for us to discuss. 
 fyi.  I faxed it to David, originals being sent to you. 
 Brian,  Could you please email the electronic version of the GE contracts which are ready for execution?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Just a reminder that the Enron team is planning to meet a half hour before the call (330).  Kay 
 In connection with the attached, please note the highlighted language at the end of the document.  We couldn't decide what it means, so it needs to be re-written or deleted.  The party we are contracting with is Virginia Power, not NC Power. If we misstated this previously, we would like to clear it up now.  Thank you,  Kay Mann 
 Karen,  It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to Enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction.  It would seem that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a result of the construction.  Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill. What is the intent?  Thank you,  Kay 
 Here are my observations:  I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk for a performance problem.  Is the reference to the "State" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?  As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.  Kay 
 I'm good anytime after 900 am on Monday.  Kay 
 Here's a marked version of suggested changes.  Would it be preferable to be consistent with the use of the names VEPCO and Capacity and Energy Agreement?    Kay 
 Good afternoon,  Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I wanted to introduce myself.  I hope we will get to meet in person soon.  Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition easier?  I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight. l won't ask any questions until I do my homework.  I look forward to seeing you soon!  Kay 
 1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through Corp (vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.  2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an exhibit. I will resend the email for your easy reference.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 Hi Heather,  Don't have the answers to your questions, but I wanted you to see the attachment to Gregg's email.  It outlines some of the commercial aspects of the loan agreement, although it might not be in a form you can easily decipher.  Kay 
 So do we now have an Enovate/enovate?  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI. 
 I had the definite impression he was going to call you.  I also know he is working on a different deal on an impossible schedule. You know the drill.  Bart is a Washington & Lee guy.  He is older than Ned, so he didn't go to school with him.  Just a little trivia...  Kay 
 Sounds like progress. 
 No response required - fyi. 
 Heather,  This is a rough cut of a services agreement.  Since the loan agreement, services agreement and LLC agreement are all pieces of the same puzzle, I thought I would send it your way.  Kay 
 Hi Fred,  I will check with Herman again to get his final comments.  Kay 
 Can Legal be far behind? 
 I'm headed to a lengthy conference call, but I wanted you to have this info.  Anything going on with Manlove?  Kay 
 FYI.  I don't think it will take long to get a draft.  I'm happy to coordinate with Sarah and Accounting.  Is it Mary Lynn that I should talk to?  Kay 
 I have not dropped it off yet.  Can he be set up for Monday? 
 FYI. 
 I working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.  She (outside counsel, Heather Brown) has summarized the information I have given her as follows (see below), and I would appreciate your input as to whether it is accurate.  Once we get a draft we can sit down and discuss it, and make sure we are on the right track. I believe Gregg said that this needs to be in place within 2 weeks.  Thanks,  Kay -------------------------------------------------------------------  Thanks for the information.  If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an "autoborrow" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people.  Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement. 
 How could I resist such an opportunity?    Enron North America Corp. 
 With a typical contractor a tight schedule usually increases the cost. You might check to see how much a delay in COD to, say Aug 1,  might lower the cost of construction.  Not to say that it will, but it might. 
 BUSY, as usual.  Kay 
 I thought Tom wanted to change the time.  Did he get with you on that? 
 Hi Heather,  Any idea what the analyst starting salary might be?  If not, can you point me in the right direction?  I know you don't have anything better to do, but I really appreciate it.  Kay 
 Heather,  Just go to your DASH form file and pull out language from another deal just like this one.  That's how we handle things on the 38th floor.  Kay 
 A more lucid explanation of the issues. 
 Lee,  Can you see me a Word (or WordPerfect) file for this letter?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Per your request.  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  I haven't seen the 501D contract yet.  Is it on its way or perhaps been misdirected?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Paul,  I've been reviewing the draft facilities agreement, which is now getting to be a hot topic.  One thing to keep in mind is that we would really prefer that the facility agreements not refer to the May 12 agreement, if this is possible.  Could you please give this some thought and review the document with this in mind?  I look forward to discussing this with you soon.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Paul,  This will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the GE contract we are working on.  Thanks,  Kay 
 3841 is my office number. 
 I've made a stab at revising Lee's letter. 
 Heather,  I haven't heard back from anyone on the single lender issue, but I say go for it, assuming a single lender deal.  At least that gives us something to work with.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Allyson,  Here's a suggestion on the language to address the issue of termination "for any reason".  On page 3, line 18, insert after "limits", deleting the remainder of the sentence:  Applicant's requirement to notify the Commission to instances where the Agreement is terminated as a result of Applicant's default.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Are we good to go?  I forgot to show  my husband your pictures.  If it is ok with you, I'll bring them back on Monday.  Have a great weekend,  Kay 
 For those who don't have these numbers, here we go:  Home    713 973 6325 Home fax  713 973 0287 Cell   713 304 8716  I have Ozzie and Heather's contact numbers as well, but don't see any reason to take up their time unless something commercial arises.  Jeff, I'll be glad to hold you numbers in trust as well.  I have nothing special planned (there goes my wild image), so I'm available anytime.  I'm going to read over the latest versions, keeping in mind that the commercial deal is done.  Kay 
 Good luck, and fire (release, shoot, fling) straight!  Kay 
 For your information. Please call me with any comments.  Thanks,  Kay 
 It took place.  We made some progress in indemnity and LOL.  The carve outs from the LOL remain an open issue.  We had some helpful discussion about assignment, but I'm not sure how much progress was made.  You were assigned NO tasks this week!  Kay 
 Stuart has finished his review of the PR invoices, and not the massive pile is on my desk. 
 Here's the VEPCO version. 
 Much grass. 
 Please start me a Fuel Cell notebook, beginning with the clean versions of the documents listed below (don't need the redline).  The binder needs to be at least a 2 inch binder.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Scott has given me some comments on the LOI, which I hope to discuss and incorporate today.  Does anyone else have any comments?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there.  I made changes in accordance with our meeting on Friday.  Please let me know what other changes you would like to see.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes. 
 fyi 
 fyi 
 FYI.  When do you think you'll be done?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a certain specification.    I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the warranties apply.  Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the units utilizing these stacks?   Kay 
 Always! 
 FYI 
 I thought someone from Trading should give this a look.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm out October 9 and 27. 
 I'm trying to pick a favorite. 
 Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.  I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.  However, I wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all the way down the line. This is a very tall order given the contracting environment.  Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.  Kay 
 I'm just afraid to say anything about anything because of what you said the other night about, gee you can't do anything right.  I guess I'm a little upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold clothes, pack the car, unpack the groceries, load the dishwasher, etc.) but if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you can't do anything right (so I should feel guilty about saying anything about anything).  Gotta go.  We can talk about it later if you want.  Love,  Kay 
 Here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers.  Is it ready to go to GE?    Scott, payment for change orders is addressed in the contract. 
 We seem to missing the termination agreement.  I'll check with Brian.  Kay 
 I would think cocktail attire.  What time are the receptions? 
 Just a small piece of internal discussions regarding the revolving line of credit and how it ties in with the enovate bank account. 
 Roxanne,  Thank you for calling last night. We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate his first day at SF, and missed your call. Michael had a great first day. All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.  I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.  We live on Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.  It is nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.  Again, thanks for calling.  Kay 
 Tough time of day to dress for, but I think  you have it figured out. 
 I don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now - I've gained weight in the past 18 months.  I may do a little shopping. 
 Hi Scott,  Here's a revised draft for your review and comment.  I've taken out the balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing what BOP entails.  So now it is just a warranty. I've also been more explicit about our fee.  I think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the uncertainty about who is doing what, but I haven't come up with a simple fix yet. 
 Sorry, didn't mean to forget you. 
 That's a good one. 
 I knew you guys would hit a home run!  I have a conference call at 330, then I'll come see you.  Kay 
 Brian,  The termination agreement needs to be signed at the same time.  Here is what I have as the latest draft:    I never received a copy of the assignment and assumption agreemen, and the legal assistants have not been able to locate it.  Has anyone found it?  If not, we need to get a copy from GE.  Kay 
 Please print for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 More to go with that other print job. 
 Warning: I have not even opened this to see how it looks.  The goal is to delete the reference to WestLB and the master agreement, so I know there is work to be done along those lines.  At least this is a start.  Kay 
 This is for the PSCO project, and Ben wants Chris to sign it.  I'm thinking that this is Dale's project, so I'm sending him a copy.  If it looks ok to you I will clean it up and send it to GE for their review.  Kay 
 Maybe I'll get your address right this time. 
 Jerry,  Thanks.  I'll give it a look immediately, and will discuss the game plan with Heather.  Congratulations on wrapping up the alliance and associated agreements.  Looks like an interesting and exciting opportunity for both companies.  Kay 
 Kent,  Here's a revised change order #2.  Please let me know if you have any comments:    Thanks,  Kay 
 Kent,  Here's a revised letter agreement.  It is being reviewed internally, but I wanted to get it to you today anyway, as I will be out of the office beginning tomorrow around 1100.  Kay 
 FYI, I am attaching the current term sheet for the Rio Gen EPC contract which is has been approved by AA and I believe Global Finance.  Kay 
 Peoples stuff. 
 Here is the current rev of the EECC "standard" form which I am reviewing/massaging in connection with the 97 10 exercise.  It includes the exhibits, where I think you can find something useful.  If this doesn't help, please let me know and I will check elsewhere.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Mark,  I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land Development the Owner?  Will it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the relevant land options and the commencement of construction?  I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.  Kay 
 Please order me a 3 hole punch and more letter size red ropes.  Thanks!!  Kay 
 The water could be 100 feet or more away from the dock, depending on how long it blows that hard.   I hope our shrimp come back. 
 There's a rumor going around that you are signing up people for the pilot= =20 program. If true, I would love to volunteer, as I work at home frequently.  Thanks, Kay 
 Gregg,  It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use. Peoples has forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.  Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting point for discussions.  Since these are forms, there will certainly be aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and Enron.  These documents should be treated as confidential.    Kay 
 Hi Ben,  Janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for development documents.  How do you want you name to read on the corporate documents?  Thanks,  Kay 
 We are very early in the process on this one, so you haven't missed out on any opportunities!  Kay 
 I volunteered to be a guinea pig. 
 I've already discussed this with Mark H. and he thought it had already been done. I haven't found any indication that it has been done.  I'll follow up immediately.  Kay 
 Deb,  I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea. I'll have to check on the expense account stuff.  Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address those, as well as ENA?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Lisa,  I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an offsite, so I might have missed something.  I'll get you a copy of CO #1.  CO #2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.  I'll have to confirm the status of the MOU and CO#3/#4.  These have bounced around a bit, so I need to nail it down so I don't give you bad information.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Not this week.  Maybe next week. 
 Hi.  Just checking in.  Michael and I are having a nice morning.  I've got my computer plugged in to my home line, but my cell phone is on.   Michael has an appointment at 230, so I will be out of a while.  This is great stay home weather.  I have fires in the fireplaces.  All I'm missing is the smell of bread baking!  Kay 
 I thought the conference was pretty good.  I had a great room, with a HUGE jacuzzi tub.  Did anyone get promoted?  No one said anything about promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.  I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got out some clothes to give to the maid.  It all feels good.  I'm going to do email now.  See you tomorrow!  Kay 
 Make that cleaned out my purse, not my person.  Geez. 
 I'm not at the office today, but I probably have a copy of the Option.  I don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase.  Do you have a copy of it to see if it gets my memory working?
