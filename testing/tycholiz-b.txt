urther to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.  BT 
 you are up early....  This Friday, Monday a.m. or Tues will be fine. Mark is in San Fransisco... who were we going to see in Sacremento.  BT 
  Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like. The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation... other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.  Pls coordinate and let me know.  BT 
 There is a cool screeen saver here that I want to save.  BT 
 Mark, Good Morning.  Any updates on Crestone structure ( re-price of deal), also, Paul discussed the Northern Border deal with potentially the producers underpinning... pls keep me posted on status.  BT 
 Didn't you trade uranium at one time.  BT 
 That was pretty funny.... he is doing research on NW utilities, however that is not their mandate to market to them... so I say, then why are you doing research... he say's ... " I'm not... who said I was"... it was about that time I started to laugh... oh well. 
 Can you find the gas daily article from Yesterday ( related to DWR purchse practices ) and e-mail or fax to jeff please.  Thanks, BT 
 Don't forget to drop the software box back to me.. I need to install my printer.  	Also, the roadrunner e-mail address seems to have disappeared off of my mainframe.. do you now why and do I have to re-install or talk to roadrunner.  Thanks, BT 
 Louise, I presume that this note was for Thurs A.M. Is it still scheduled.  BT 
 I need to get paid out for this years efforts first... if that isn't forthcoming.. then I can start tommorrow.  otherwise Q1/02.  BT 
 Ozzie and I are going to the Front porch after work... 5:00 PM..  I thought I would invite you, I know we could all use a couple.  I will buy.  BT 
 Jeff, Just looking at teeing my a schedule.. any feedback from either/ both.  BT 
 Make sure Fuller pays up..... I know he has some money hidden somewhere.... thanks. BT 
 I have put down 2:00 - 2:30 on Nov. 6/01.  Pls come by 3206b.  If this is not a good fit, just let me know and we can re-schedule.  BT 
 yes but can you spell... 
 I am not waiting for the stock... just cash now.  Don't know if I will get enough of that either.  I don't mind working for a few more years.. just don't want it to be 20 more.  I don't think I will be in Denver that early.... What's going on?  Calgary, Who knows?????  Stock meltdown is a long story... perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment.. we are in preservation mode right now.... but I believe things will be fine. All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.  Better run, let's talk soon.  BT 
 Is there an action item with regards to the preparation of agreements?  If so, I would like Dave Fuller in Portland to work on the creation of the appropriate gas contracts and the discussions with Puget.  Please advise. BT 
 Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?  BT 
 Lorelie, I had sent to you last week a amending doc regarding a one month extension that the customer was looking for in order to exercise the option on some of that small volume.  They have contacted us and I beleive they will be exercising and would like to get the paperwork back in order to get this process moving.  Can you please have document signed and returned to me soonest.  Thanks, BT 
 Hi there... can you do me a favor and get me the Home, Cell and work numbers of the following people in Canada.  Milly, Peter Keohane, Eric Ledain, Derek Davies,  Thanks. BT 
 pls load into my cell phone. 
 thanks mike. BT 
 what about a contract position.... 3 months or something. I was talking to Steve South.. I know steve would like to pick his brain for a while.  BT 
 Oz,.... i am going to pull the shoot early today (3:00) .... sorry about that... as such, drinks is going to have to wait.  BT 
 Guys.... as discussed, I am going to be tight on time tommorrow as such, I am going to take my own car up... and would suggest you two carpool together....  I am leaving houston at 8:00 AM and need to be back by 3:30... thanks.  BT 
 has there been a big run up in the pricing on this metal.  BT 
 Mark, I have reviewed this file and believe it is accurate up to the end of Q3.. Can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance.. I am not worried about 10 or 20,000 either way because I don't think we will manage down to that level anyways.  BT 
 Thank you for meeting with us this week. Speaking on behalf of Enron U.S. I know there was some very good clarification, information and hopefully action required by all the parties.  I look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss.  I have also met with our legal team to discuss the commercial and legal issues related to the GISB ( under 30 day firm agreement ) and need to discuss the details with you to see if we can get the proper paper completed. I have also raised a draft Master Firm agreement ( to handle term structures) and will begin to review this for early next week also.  Thanks in advance,   Barry Tycholiz Vice President Enron North America 
 Same.... 
 I think I had the wrong address for you Veronica... trust this finds you this time. BT 
 Mark, I was talking to Jay on Friday and he was telling about Kerr McGee shutting down their operations. Is there any play here for you guys.?  BT 
 Let's try to get together today.  BT 
 Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?  We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.  BT 
 Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.  Pls keep me posted.  BT 
 I am out of town tues, weds.. pls schedule for some time on thurs.  BT 
 Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.  SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues. Don't know if there is a deal here or not?  Thanks, BT 
 I am track you down on more details or your ability to get them... stay tuned. Thanks, and please disregard spell check comments.  evn I mak misstackes ounce and a wile!! 
 Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento... I can make that. Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city. Any word from SOCALED.  Give me a call this a.m. and we can figure out travel plans.  BT 
 Mark, let's discuss letter to BP prior to it going out this a.m.  BT 
 Faizal,.... did you ever get a refresh of numbers from us for gas supply on the new IPP you were working on?  If you have time, give me a call and you can update me on things you are looking for.  regards,  BT  713-853-1587 
 Can you get me a map / printout to get to this location and also to SMUD 6301 S Stree, Sacremento.  BT 
 Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight. I have a car and will talk to you enroute to Sacremento.  I am staying and meeting with SMUD at 11:30 - 1:00 and then probably meeting with PG&E on tues at 3:30.  I will either leave for Houston tues night or weds a.m. pending any possible meeting with SocalEd in L.A.  If we cannot meet with them this week, then I may reconsider that trip for next week.  Thanks, BT 
 Jaime, thanks for setting up last weeks meetings... I thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties.  We will follow up directly with Pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals.  Did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters?  Is there any specific action required by west gas at this time, if so, pls contact me to coordinate?  regards,  BT 
 We need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations Pemex believes they will have in the next 1 - 5,10 years.  The more obligation they have at the border, the better off we are..  What they used to deliver upstream of the border, we can replace for them synthetically.  Pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days.  BT 
 Jessica, pls schedule Chris for Thurs. BT 
 Dave, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.  Louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere!  Pls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with Karen Buckley ( et al ).  Let's re-visit program in mid-december.  regards,  Barry Tycholiz 
 Bill, as part of our conference call this a.m.... please have Debbie identify the top 20 companies that we have out of the money positions to and that we would want to assign in the money deals to. Included in this list we must know the contractual terms of these counter parties including, company name, collateral threshold limits, collateral posted, type of contract ( gas or power ...etc.) Physical or financial. Master Netting...  In addition to this, we must determine if we can cross pollinate agreements... I.E... a gas agreement is used to offset a power position or vice versa.  Lot's of questions but to start, let's get your list of " Co's who are seeking collateral from us today" and fill in some of these blanks.  Thanks, BT 
 Jeff, I believe that your total loss payable equates to $55.00. John and I netted out  so you can pay me directly.  Thanks, BT

 Jay, do we have copy's of all the executed documents... and if so, where are you going to put them. Also, did we change the counterparty names in the system and put in offsetting transactions with SOCAL etc.... and new positions with PG&E.  These need to go into the system. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS.   BT 
 nice to know that people care... thanks so much for the note... it is a bit crazy... hope to be able to talk to you soonest.   my home phone # is 713-667-9556 incase all else blows up, but it doesn't look like it is going to right at this moment.   BT 
 David, I just received a call from Mark Whitt and Paul Lucci.  They have been advised by there banks that the cheques being deposited today will take 4 days to clear.  Although you have indicated that there are no issues related to these funds..... I am contacting you to see if there is any way to either authorize the wire immediatly or provide for a faster solution.  Thanks in advance and if you are able to do so, communicate response and cc me as required.    BT

 Great Pictures of the kids.... 
 Mara, it appears that the PGE Topack curve is pulling in the wrong file in the swap spread model.... pls fix.  Bt 
 Leon, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect. This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to. However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.  As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines.  Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.  Thanks. Barry Tycholiz 713-646-2391 (Fax ) 713-853-1587 (Phone) 
 I tried to call you last night around 6:00.  I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.  Call me this a.m.  BT 
 Jim, stephanie will be in this morning, cannot do lunch, and we will be back to you by 12:00 our time to confirm the 4:00 pm conference call.  Thanks, BT 
 stephanie, I know that Ed McMicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our tran
