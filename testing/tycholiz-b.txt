 I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high.  BT

 Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent assignment of PGT capacity.  The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we will begin working on this immediately.  Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required.  ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or annuity amount. As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to be confirmed ). ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the Spark Spread proposal. Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review.  Regards,  BT

 I have the putter at home.. I will throw in my trunk tommorrow... and we can meet at lunch if you would like. I will not leave town without getting this to you somehow.  TIC 
 Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.  Producer Services Transportation Origination/ Middle Marketing Trading   Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new group.  The key subject items should include:  SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will we implement ?) SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?) BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc.   If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives.  Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  BT  Thanks,  BT 
 You are correct that the PRC is in Houston.... Is there a flight later than that.? 
 Sorry I could not pick you up.... Any format that works for you... This will end up in a power point slide presentation so I have been told.  thanks, BT 
 I am almost out of days, but on Dec. 8 ( friday) they are throwing a small party ??? for me at the Garage from 3-6 pm that I would love for you guys to come to...I hope that would work for you.  TIC 
 We will have to use that one as a back up plan.... 
 For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to Calpine for their consideration.  Action:  Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will discuss on Monday.  Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal.   Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves for a package out to the producers for early next week.  Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... overview... do we have anything available.  Talk to everyone on Monday.  BT
