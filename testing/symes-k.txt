cing purposes it doesn't matter whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower because that would mess with the routing.  Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and I'll talk to Sean.  Thanks, Kate 
 Re: 491609 - This is trade date 1/5/01. It's been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Tom checked with APB and they recognize the trade. Are they not checking out correctly in the back office? 
 Mike is still entering his deals. These are good, and should be seen in the system momentarily.  Kate 
 As per your request, here are the names and addresses of people Laura Wente and I sent maps to today:  Tim Carlberg Avista Corp. 1411 E. Mission P.O. Box 3727 Spokane, WA 99220-3727  Mark Ewbank Herrera Environmental Consultants, Inc. 2200 6th Ave., Suite 601 Seattle, WA 98121-1820  Let me know if you need anything else regarding these mailings. I'm sure I'll be back there soon to ask for another map!  Kate

 We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this carefully....  SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak  NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak  If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell him to do the same.  Thanks, Kate 
 Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.  Thanks, Kate 
 I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response - I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on these deals.  Kate 
 You're all set. Just to confirm, these are the deals I've approved and auto-scheduled.  483074 - 12/21/00 471891 - 12/4/00 through 12/31/00  Let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Thanks, Kate 
 This deal has been changed to MTWTFS, on peak hours. Mike Driscoll's mask in Deal Blotter was incorrect.  Thanks, Kate 
 Jeff had just noticed this mistake and changed CTPY to Sempra.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/22/2001 12:43 PM 
 To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning:  Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.  Bell, Alexander Graham  b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Can.  Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction, with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession. His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.  Alexander ("Graham" was not added until he was 11) was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell. Apart from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High School (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family trained and self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in Elgin, County Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.  In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their only surviving son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after settling near Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved.  In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching speech to the deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be known, showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture.  Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments with sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf, edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and tutor; in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University.  Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. Nevertheless, during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again suffered. On April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while maintaining his daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in Canada to recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone. On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number 174,465 covering "The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."  Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, the first of hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone--until then all too often regarded as a joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which persisted throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 1877 Bell married Mabel Hubbard, 10 years his junior.  The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in many ways it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone--transmission of sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.  In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs (roughly equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax cylinders and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording. Bell's share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau building--today an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf.  In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a summer home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories.  In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National Geographic Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his future son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world.  As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century, he experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an inspiration, Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group, soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization established and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell. At Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar detection, solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil craft, one of which weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per hour in 1919.  Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never lingered on one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at hand--reminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for aerial vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell.  Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal. During his last dictation he was reassured with "Don't hurry," to which he replied, "I have to." 
 I added a fee of 0.0075 to this deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 This deal has been changed to firm energy.  Kate 
 Mike Swerzbin just checked out with broker. Only one deal changed.  502391 Mid-C  502392 Palo Verde 
 Yes, these are two separate, but identical deals. Thanks for double-checking.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/22/2001 02:20 PM 
 The following attachment contains fixed prices for EPMI Short Term California sales to EES for 1/24.    Call me, 503.464.7486, or Chris Mallory, 503.464.3823, with any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Apparently Jeff thought this had already been changed , and it hadn't - I just changed it.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:  493989 Sell SCEM Jun-01 198.00 Mid-C  493988 Sell SCEM Jun-01 195.00 Mid-C  Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, they're good to go.  Thanks, Kate    Stephanie Piwetz   01/23/2001 01:14 PM 
 Bob is just entering these deals now.  Kate 
 Broker is correct - this has been changed.  kate 
 Both deals have been changed.  Kate 
 I've been working with Laura Wente to locate these documents for a couple days, and I think I've found what you need. If you could call or e-mail with your fax number, I'll send what I have over to you and expedite the process. If you'd like to peruse the EIS documents online, go to www.tis.eh.doe.gov/nepa/ and click the heading DOE NEPA Analyses.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. My phone number is 503.464.3748.  Kate 
 Joaner Boner - Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night. Wheeew!  Happy Sexy Body New Year, Kate 503.819.2181 
 Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient.  NP-15 On Peak - $273.50 Off Peak - $204.43  SP-15 On Peak - $216.53 Off Peak - $189.35  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the original one and leave it at that.  Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no confirm"? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 Diana Scholtes was the trader on these. She's not in today, but Sean Crandall said that a 1/8 trade date was okay. I've changed all the deals.  Kate 
 It's an Amerex deal. I've changed it.  Kate 
 Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.  Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 499-3234. I hope this helps.  Thanks, Kate 
 Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.  I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this "Rocky Mountain High" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this "normal" guy. You've got to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration with candles.  Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.  Love, Kate 
 PS - "Go Nuggets!" sounds like someone with a stutter saying "Go Nuts!" 
 I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. Here it is:  Ext. 7486 Cell phone 819-2181  And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I figured I'd let you know before I forgot.  Thanks, Kate 
 Please join me in congratulating Kate on her new position at the Deal Control desk. She will make the change from Origination to Trading effective Wednesday, Nov. 8. We wish her success in the endeavor, even as we are beside ourselves at such a loss.  Our new clerk, Theresa Villeggiante, will join the ranks on Thursday. In the meantime, please try to ween yourselves away from using Kate's services. Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative Assistant.  This will help us keep track of tasks and complete them in a timely manner.  Thanks for your help and congratulations, Kate!  Mollie 
 P.P.S. I just got Monica's number from Amber (for about the 30th time) and here it is: (303) 322-5035. Sorry that took so long. Call her now, though. She's excited to hear from you.  K 
 Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone.  Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.  Talk to you soon, Kate 
 Grace, you should be a mid-marketer - you've got that supply and demand thing DOWN, girl! 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes - I just changed the deal to reflect 0.01 broker fee.  Kate 
 Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.  Kate 
 505425 & 505427 have both been changed to Tradition for broker.  505431 has been changed to Coral.  Kate 
 Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept "sticking it out another month" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we know, or would like to know.  It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think you'll know if Denver is really "your kind of town." In the meantime, just take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a habitat, but you get the picture.  Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk - away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as "Brian's Trip to Portland." It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew it.....constantly.  Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile "the rest of our lives" are slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, "Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans." Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.  Love, Kate 
 This deal was in under the wrong broker - 505229 - it's been changed. 
 505434 - Killed.  505066 - Changed to APB.  505313 - Changed to APB. (505229 - Kept the same.)  Hope this all makes sense - for not trading much today these guys are screwing up left and right!   Stephanie Piwetz   01/25/2001 01:44 PM 
 Hi Stephanie -  I just spoke with Diana about this deal and she indicated she had already cleared it up with you. Let me know if there's anything else. Thanks!  Kate    Stephanie Piwetz   11/08/2000 02:42 PM 
 I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.  Kate 
 505118 & missing deal are Jeff Richter's - he's on a conference call and will get back to me in two minutes.  505223 has been changed to 300.00.  Kate 
 505118 has been changed to 1/26 -1/27. Still checking on missing deal. 
 Deal that matches 505118 is in - #504970.  Thanks for waiting, Kate 
 I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?  Kate 
 That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which NCPA shortname they're choosing.  Kate 
 I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.  Thanks, Kate 
 You're right - I've changed the deal to APS and e-mailed the Real Time group to let them know of this situation - they were unaware of the difference.  Thanks, kate 
 A Real Time guy mistakenly sold to Coral instead of using their established PGE transmission deal. 505750 has been killed and the transmission has been re-scheduled under deal #146517.  Kate 
 Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service Company." All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself. This should change sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. Let me know if you have any questions.  Kate 
 Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error message stating the following:  Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked (_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4)  Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my merry way. Just thought you should know. 
 This was under the wrong counterparty - it's 506051. 
 Broker is right - it's been changed. 
 This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa! 
 Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me good.  Thanks, Kate 
 Broker is right - deal has been changed.  By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.   Stephanie Piwetz   01/26/2001 02:25 PM 
 I can't believe you're leaving! I hope wherever you go next brings you joy and fulfillment, but you'll definitely be missed here. Thanks for all your help. Good luck!  Kate 
 I'm sorry - I totally spaced this one Friday afternoon. I did talk to Sean and he confirmed the price at 390.00. It's been changed. Thanks for the reminder.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/29/2001 07:28 AM 
 The contact name is Jack Wells, and his phone number is (281) 293-6030. Would you like me to enter this info into the deals?  Kate 
 I guess Paul Choi spoke with Melissa Murphy when she was up here and told her the language looked fine on this confirmation. He reiterated that, and I'll fax the initialed copy back to you.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/29/2001 10:58 AM 
 Thank you, Evelyn. I've back-dated Deal #456173 to 11/9. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Kate 
 Deal is 507436 - Sean forgot the broker - it's been added.  Thanks, Kate 
 This is Mike Swerzbin's deal - he's finishing up entering deals right now.  Kate 
 I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.  In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.  Thanks, Kate 
 Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, but our take is that these deals are separate.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily correction log. Hopefully this will incite everyone to pay more attention to the counterparty names they choose.  Thanks again, Kate 
 You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you know I'm not ignoring you.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty you're trading with?  We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between changing incorrect counterparty names!  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike just finished entering deals. Missing deals are:  509064 509063  Chris just changed 508224 to Prebon for broker.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 I checked with Sean, who said he's finished entering his deals. Mike is just finishing up with his. Jeff Richter, however, still has about 8 deals to enter. This should be done within the next few minutes.  Please let me know if these don't come through shortly.  Thanks, Kate 
 No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals were in under Prebon - 509009/010 have been changed to APB.  Tom does not recognize last deal.  K 
 508786 has been changed to 50 MW.  509085 was just entered: Enron buys Duke 50 MW Cal-02 PV 135.00  K 
 P.S. Tom had 509009 and 509010 in under wrong broker - they've been changed. 
 sorry i didn't respond right away - I was looking for the deal, and I found it. 508437 is the number, I've changed it to APB for broker.  K 
 Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct counterparty names.  Kate 
 I'm so sorry! You must have this a standard response e-mail for misdirected messages. Thanks for the heads up.  Kate 
 Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct counterparty names.  Kate 
 which book? and are you calling me a hen?  K 
 Now, is that any way to be treating a poor, unsuspecting beer? Didn't your mother teach you that grabbing is impolite?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Both of these deals were broker errors. Following are the corrections and deal numbers:  # 457428 Mike Swerzbin buying Transalta 117.50 25 MW Dec Mid C On Peak  #457432 Mike Swerzbin buying Williams 84.00 25 MW Q1 NP-15 On Peak  Thanks for the heads up. Let me know if there's anything else.  Kate 
 She did teach me to answer SOMEONE'S questions, but I don't even know who SOMEONES is! She also taught me to embrace my rudeness.  K    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 These volumes reflect Cal-ISO cuts. Fun! 
 Should have been CAISO - I changed it.  Kate 
 These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!  Kate 
 no way! you look MUCH better than that! 
 Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the counterparty could be either Conoco Pipeline Co. or Conoco Power Marketing. If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. There are five different names under Transalta.)  The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made the "error." This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be unaware of the difference between "Dynegy Marketing & Trade" and "Dynegy Power Marketing." I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the company.  If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who can, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks, Kate 
 FYI 
 I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the contact name in the comments section.  Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact for this or how we can set this up.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's a rough version. I think I included everything you mentioned. Let me know if you think anything needs to be added. 
 Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.  Thanks for your help.  Kate 
 They've all been changed. Sorry for the delay. Chaos!  Kate 
 No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having problems figuring out who they do and do not trade with. We're going to have a conversation about this in a minute when I come up for air from this whole California mess. In the meantime, I've changed this to Enron Energy Services, Inc.  Thanks, Kate 
 In all the excitement of the day, I completely forgot to check on this deal. I know I got a call from one of you guys about the "New Counterparty" Diana Scholtes put in here; but I'm not sure now what I was supposed to check on.  Give me a call in the morning and let me know. Sorry!  Kate 
 I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.  If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to get them in the system shortly.  Thanks, Kate 
 I guess the broker resolved this - I checked and it is APB's deal. Let me know if there's still a discrepancy.  Thanks, kate 
 I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.  Thanks, kate 
 I checked with Diana Scholtes, the trader on this deal, and she said the counterparty was supposed to be CERS - California Energy Resource Schedulers. I've changed the name, but let me know if your records still show California Dept. of Water Resources.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mark looked at the confirm and said it lookes A.O.K. Sorry I'm late in getting back to you - I was out sick yesterday. This weather is not helping!  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/02/2001 07:21 AM 
 I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole term of the deal.  404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index 512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index 512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index  Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Deal 456717 has been changed to reflect Pinnacle West Capital Corp, and the traders have been reminded of the name change.  Chris Mallory said he entered the index deal selling to Calpine at about 2:15 PST today. The deal # is 457473.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name "California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me know and I'll change those counterparty names too.  510867/860/857/853/775/774  509540/518/513/511/509/508/504/463/462  Thanks for your help on this.  Kate 
 Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and not eternal grayness.  Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.  I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?  Take care, Kate 
 These have been changed, and I'll send an e-mail out to the traders as a reminder.  Thanks, kate 
 Chris Mallory and the Prebon broker are currently debating this price. I'll let you know when they settle it.  Thanks, Kate 
 I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark Fischer deal?  Kate 
 The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day. But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away.  Kate 
 Both deals have been changed - 512924 has been changed to no confirmation. 512929 has been given a contact name. And thanks for the update on daily deal confirmations.  Kate 
 Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak. Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know.  Thanks, kate 
 512827 has been changed. I'm still tracking down Bob to find out about his deal. I'll let you know.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/05/2001 06:37 AM 
 Then it's in correctly - thanks. 
 Just FYI - The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as Enron Online deals. Oh joy!  I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning series. (How about "The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge"?)  Kate 
 Chris and the broker agreed to the broker's price - I've changed this deal to a price of 165.00. Thanks for waiting.  Kate 
 512927 has also been changed to .005 broker fee.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/05/2001 06:37 AM 
 513386 has been changed. 514418 - no such deal. 
 513386 - changed to APB.  514157 - Mike is checking with broker on this. 
 Mike is just finishing up entering his deals - should show up in a second. 
 514118 was changed to COB. 
 I'm sending a copy of the error message I received when I tried to enter our futures deals today. The application saved one deal, but would not accept the other two. The only difference between the three deals is the delivery month. Is there any way we can get this fixed soon? The clearing broker has had a record of these deals since Jan. 31, and the trader is getting a little antsy to have them recorded in our system. Thanks so much for your help....  ORA-20500: Unable to translate deal QQ0938.0 into ERMS system. ORA-06512: at "BIG.SP_XINSTR_INS", line 173 ORA-06512: at "BIG.TRG_XINSTR_AI", line 22 ORA-04088: error during execution of trigger 'BIG.TRG_XINSTR_AI'   No changes made to database.  Good luck! Kate 
 Both deals have been changed to offset -1.0.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/06/2001 08:19 AM 
 wussup wichu, brutha? just wanted to let you know i'm done with your book. it was a superior work of literature, by the way. i highly recommend it. if you want it back, send a self-addressed stamped box to 2505 NE 32nd Pl., Portland, OR 97212. just kidding....gosh! that's the address of my super-sweet house, by the way. next time you're in town you have to come over and have a civilized dinner in our DINING ROOM. that's right - we have one. and many other rooms too. it's an all-around great place to be, let me tell you. gotta go control your energy now. write back.  love, kate 
 Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this "project." Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here are all of the deal numbers that correspond with today's tie point, Cal PX, and Cal Imbalance deals. I erased the EOL transaction numbers on the first four, but I believe they were going in a sequence beginning at 627.  Thanks so much for your help on this.  458259 458260 64 65 66 Tie Points 67 69 70  458271 72 PX 73  458276 58 Imbalance 
 Willie - Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:  Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract  Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index.  Thank you so much for your help.  Kate (503) 464-7486 
 I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike just talked to the broker and told me it is Merrill - deal has been changed. 
 Broker is right - deal has been changed to .015 broker fee. 
 hey - how's your sexy body? don't have much time right now, but thought i'd drop a line to tell you that i'm so broke i'm considering picking up some unmentionable weekend job and therefore cannot make it down there for prezzy's day weekend. i'm so pissed! but it will happen soon - and anytime you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my absence with a bottle of wine tonight.  kate 2505 NE 32nd Place Portland, OR 97212 (503) 288-6546 
 Broker is correct - deal has been changed. 
 broker is correct - deal has been changed 
 looks like that's the price in the deal....am i missing it? 
 mike just checked with broker - it's 54.05. 
 Just for everyone's information - I've entered two buys from Seattle City Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868). The deals are as follows:  515404 STCA buys SCL 2/8/01-2/28/01 SP-15 Off Peak $115.00  515420 LTCA buys SCL 3/1/01-3/31/01 SP-15 Off Peak $115.00  I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal, the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc. The volume is shaped between 1 and 2 MW. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal #458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be changed, I'll follow up with those too.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/14/2000 02:16 PM 
 Attached are the EPMI-EES sale prices for the first week of February. I will resume responsibility for maintaining and sending the spreadsheet tomorrow, and you can expect to receive it daily. Thanks for your patience while we were working out the kinks on this one.  Kate 
 Diana is again not in today, but Sean Crandall is checking on it. I'll let you know any minute.  Kate 
 Checked with EES - Bob Badeer's deals are off peak. They've been changed.  515040 - changed last night to 275  Sean Crandall is entering the last deal right now. I'll let you know the deal number in a minute.  Thanks, Kate 
 This was entered before we had the option in EnPower to enter deals under California Energy Resource Schedulers - CERS. It's been changed.  Kate 
 Broker checked out incorrectly with Matt - deal has been changed to Nevada.  Kate 
 deal has been changed 
 mike's just getting out of a meeting - i'll check with him - has 25 mw in his trade log. 
 it's been changed 
 516626 Sell BP 25 mw 175.00/on peak q4-01  516627 sell williams 25 mw 175.00/on peak q4-01  And the last deal is in, according to Tom and Mike Swerzbin - Tom entered it, but it's in Mike's book. Let me know if it's still not in there.  Kate 
 516605 516606  should be in there. 
 Swerzbin just entered the deal - sells to Duke January Mid-C $118 On Peak Deal #458748  I changed Deal #457993 to Pinnacle West Corp. and reminded Diana AGAIN of the name change.  Thanks, Kate 
 516651 - Tom told me he had already put it in; then Mike just brought the same deal to me to put in - sorry about that! 
 The contact is James McFall - it's been added.  Kate 
 There is no correction report for 2/7; however, this e-mail was returned to me last night. Here goes again..... 
 515166 and 515167 have been changed to 50 MW.  Kate 
 I spoke with Sean Crandall, who told me that from his standpoint the deals ARE separate; however, John Malowney is the mid-marketer who works with Conoco, and he told me that this special language is fine to include in the confirmations for these deals. Turns out I was just asking the wrong person.  Let me know if you need comments added in these deals.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/08/2001 08:20 AM 
 Mike Swerzbin said okay to off-peak on these deals. They've been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Just to let you all know - the following deals have been changed per Mike Swerzbin -  516611 - from H01 to Q3-01 516618 - from 10 mw to 16 mw 516651 - from Mid-C to Palo  Let me know if you have any questions about these changes. (Most were due to my inability to read his handwriting!)  Thanks, Kate 
 It's just been changed. 
 I've changed these to Firm energy.  Kate 
 It was in - just missing broker, but it's fixed now. 
 Thanks, Laura. Today is the kind of day I need to be reminded of SOME reason why it's good to be me. 
 Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers along for reference. They are as follows:  TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01) QQ3837 (K-01) QQ7050 (M-01)  ENPOWER Swap Deals - 517925 (J-01) 517928 (K-01) 517929 (M-01)  Thank you for all of your patience and cooperation. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Kate Symes (503) 464-7486 
 These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have contact info.  Thanks, kate 
 517384 - price has been changed to $260 517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed to LTNW 517884 - price has been changed to $300 517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been changed to LTNW  Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three different desks at once gets a little hectic!  Let me know if you have questions.  Kate 
 508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal Mirant checkout)  All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry if I scared you for a minute there! 
 I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin, the trader on these deals. They're both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 475170 has been changed to .0075 broker fee. 
 changed 
 i'm just entering those deals. 
 this is a broker mistake - they didn't mean to put out this number, and called us to break the trade - they shouldn't be checking it out.  thanks, kate 
 All of these deals have been changed. We had a problem with Mark's defaults this morning.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/14/2000 02:55 PM 
 this is a tom alonso deal - he's just finishing deal entry 
 Deal number is 518995. Thanks for waiting.  Kate 
 Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.  Let me know if there are further questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 It was a deal with Pacificorp - new trader error. It's been changed.  Thanks, kate 
 Mike Driscoll just talked with the broker, and they agreed to the price Enron has - broker will change the checkout sheet now. Sorry for the confusion.  Kate 
 I just got out of a meeting and read your e-mails. I have no idea why she would have used this counterparty name, but looks like it's all taken care of. Let me know if you need anything further on this.  Kate 
 These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.  Kate 
 Just changed it - Matt's book had a .015 fee in it, so I changed it to that. Does Natsource agree? 
 We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal that looked like "no bro" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually ".015 bro." Anyway, that's probably more information than you needed.....sorry!  Kate 
 458406 has been changed to off peak.  458733 - Chris thinks this is with APB, but says it may be Prebon. We tried to check with Prebon or APB, but no one was at either desk. I'll try to contact Evelyn (who I think checks out with Prebon) to see if she's missing any deals.  Let me know if APB gets back to you.  Thanks, Kate 
 Diana says it's definitely on peak hours. Let me know.... 
 I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on for the past few weeks.  Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. Am I missing something?  As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do their jobs - do you know anything about that?  I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in any way.  Thanks, Kate 
 All of these have been changed, and the real time desk has been alerted. I believe Bill Williams is working on a list for his traders to refer to when in doubt of counterparty names. I'll check up on that and let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.  Kate  red = correct counterparty name blue = incorrect counterparty name 
 Great - that all sounds about like what I'd expected. Thanks for the multiple-terminal-server tip. Again, I'm more than happy to help get this forward obligation report up to speed and producing the kind of data we need - just let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other data you'd like to see in graph form? 
 Please note that there were cuts on 2/11 and 2/12, so there will be slight changes in the fixed price sale volumes. Call with questions.  Kate 503-464-7486 
 You're welcome. 
 Mike Driscoll just checked with the broker - it should be SP-15 - he's having the back office change it.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, it's been killed. Thanks for checking on that.  Kate 
 1. 458641 is correct.  2. 458801  3. 458802  And 458718 has been changed to a PM expiry time.  Thanks, Kate 
 No, thank you! I've changed it to CAISO energy.  Kate 
 Mike Driscoll is entering a bunch of deals for Swerzbin right now - they'll be done in just a minute. 
 changed 
 changed 
 521718 changed to Prebon 
 521620 - changed to Amerex  And Mike Driscoll is entering the Sierra Pacific sell right now. 
 521628 and 522087 - both are sells to Sierra Pacific - 25 mw each for a total of 50 mw sale to SP. 
 It's just been put in - Mike forgot about an EES sleeve. 
 The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones daily index price. And that's the long and short of it.  The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:  Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases Reported NP-15 Sales Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250 Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260 Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270  Now that's simple!  Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.  American Electric Power - Amerelecpo Avista Energy - Avistaene Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra El Paso Merchant Energy Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene PacifiCorp - PACE Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E Powerex Corp. - PWX Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) - SCEM TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt  So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free to come bug me with questions. Good luck!  Kate 
 I've added APB as the broker on 521454.  Thanks, Kate 
 I think I found what you're looking for:  www.ferc.fed.us  Once you get to the home page, click on the "gas" icon. From there, hit the link to the "FERC Gas Tariffs Page." Then it gives you a choice of viewing the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file.  I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.  If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking. 
 Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.  One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily calculation.  Thanks again, Kate 
 I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in just a minute.  Thanks, Kate 
 517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like to take care of it myself if I can.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks for the spreadsheet, Stephanie. Mike just stepped off the desk for about 15 minutes. I'll look over all the documents with him when he gets back and let you know, Kerri.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/14/2001 10:17 AM 
 You're right - 458802 is a deal with Constellation, but it's part of a sleeve Mike Swerzbin did for EES. Thanks for the spreadsheet, and for getting me on the mailing list.  Kate 
 missing broker - I added Natsource. 
 Checking with Jeff Richter on these - give me one minute to get a call back. 
 this has been changed. 
 sorry! that's a little vague - it's been changed to CAISO energy. 
 Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to be changed (i.e. "yes-agreement" or "yes-counterparty to send confirm"), and I'll do that right away.  Thanks, Kate 
 The following deals were changed to "Yes" confirm status and given contact names:  522892/522906/522916/522924  Kate 
 Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, who entered the deal with Valley Electric.  Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake.  Thanks, Kate 
 these are 50 mw - they've been changed. 
 Yes - this is Nevada Power - it's been changed. 
 Mike says it's 50 mw - I'll change it when Risk is done with the calc.  Thanks, Kate 
 1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me know. 2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals:  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected 2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added 3) 524482 - same terms - added  Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 Matt Motley deal 524143 Per Amerex the price should be $263 not $163 - price changed to $263  Mike Swerzbin deal 524171 Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300  deal 524172 Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300  deal 524267 Per Amerex the total mw should be 50 not 25 - MW should be 25 - other side of sleeve is 25 MW  deal 524310 Per Amerex the term should be March not April - term should be April  I am missing the following deal: Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 - part of a spread sleeve done with EES and El Paso - only one broker fee agreed upon - fee included on deal 524247 NOT 524248  Jeff Richter deal 523881 Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - on peak deal - does not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)  deal 523882 Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above  The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.  Thanks, Kate 
 These were entered late. 
 Jeff Richter - all deals are on peak - do not recognize Sunday off-peak hours  Chris Mallory - 523831 changed to Bloomberg deal  Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at $260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where they got that from...  Thanks, Kate 
 I'll have to ask Mike about this in the morning - he's in that conference for the afternoon. It says 25 mw in his trade log. 
 We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out though!  Thanks, Kate 
 This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?  Kate 
 453152   broker has .0075 - trader mistake/should be .0075 not .75  450710  broker has .0075 - trader mistake/should be .0075  451976  broker has .0075 - part of sleeve/either 451976 or 451977 should have .0075 fee  457489  broker has .0075 - no broker fee  457465  broker has .0075 - no broker fee  454511  broker has .0075 - part of sleeve/either 454511 or 454512 should have .0075 fee  Would you like me to go ahead and make these changes? Please let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thought I'd mix it up a little and send you a completely unrelated document yesterday....what fun! Anyway, sorry for the mix-up - I was on autopilot. Here's the updated EES spreadsheet through Sunday, Feb. 18. Call with questions.  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 
 These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports.  Thanks, Kate 
 Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?  Kate 
 Surprise, surprise - Mike checked with his broker at Amerex, who said he has April written down for this trade. Mike asked him to re-confirm with his back office. The contact in this deal is Bert Dunn, if you need to give them a name of someone to speak to.  Thanks, Kate 
 Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - price is $285.95) Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.  Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.  Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.  Let me know if this resolves everything.  Kate 
 It's been changed - and out of curiosity, when does Daylight Savings Time start? March, I think? 
 Mike verified it at 50 mw - it's changed. 
 525523 - Enron buys Duke, March, NP-15, 50 mw, $265 - MISSING BROKER - I'VE ADDED PREBON  Mike just entered his deal - 525558  Can't locate the last deal - left message for Diana - I'll let you know. 
 It's changed. 
 It's been changed. 
 I'm sorry for the delay on this, Tim. I've been in contact with Will Smith in Houston since yesterday to try to fix the problem of PX, Imbalance, and Tie Point deals uploading as Enron Online deals. Here are the correct statistics. 
 Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and we've got a chance at the championship!  I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so to speak.  In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)  Kate Symes (True Blazer Fan Contact) West Power Trading 503-464-7486  Mollie Gustafson (Contact by Virtue of Job Title) West Origination 503-464-3817 
 It's CAISO energy - and I've changed it. I guess some kinks are there to stay, huh? I will have a great weekend, thanks - I'm actually having a housewarming party at my new house! You have fun too!  Kate 
 How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.  Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her.  Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents on Monday.  Kate 
 I just found the deal, and as I suspected, it had the incorrect broker on it.  525180 Sell Avista Mid-C 2/19-2/20 25 mw 325.00 PREBON  Thanks, Kate 
 Please note an addition to the daily EOL summary. Two new tables delineate each desk's year-to-date trades, in addition to the month-to-date and daily trade tables usually included in the report. Feel free to let me know if you find this data helpful, harmful, or not even worthy of note.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey Dad - Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?  Kate 
 Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the urgent ones.  Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia story. We did watch two fabulous films - "The Virgin Suicides" and "Croupier," both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out.  Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure somebody lives there now.  I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll let you know when I hear from him.  Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that.  Take care, Kate 
 It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for you. Let me know.  Kate 
 FYI - I've entered a new index-forward per Paul Choi into Matt Motley's Long Term Southwest book. The sale is a replica of deal #501404, except deal term is March instead of February. All other terms are the same. New deal # is 526973 .  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kate 
 Changes have been made to deals 453152, 450710, 451976, and 454511.  Thanks, Kate 
 Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.  As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed.  Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night. I'd give it an unenthusiastic "mediocre." Rent it if you've exhausted all other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out "Traffic" - I've heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's "Cinema Paradiso" for the sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor will be money, and beer. "Traffic" will cost twice as much as "Cinema," but the theater showing "Cinema" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end up spending twice as much as I would at "Traffic." Do you see the moral dilemma here?  I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.  Kate 
 Wow! That's so exciting to see the words "clean checkout" associated with OUR beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the interest of accuracy I'm also trying to be thorough. So feel free to give me a nudge every once in awhile.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey there stranger!  Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail.  I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.  Take care, Kate 
 In all the confusion last week, I can't remember if we figured this one out! Let me know.  Kate 
 FYI 
 Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them.  And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system. Sounds pretty logical to me!  Kate 
 Somebody needs to remember to cover more skin in public..... 
 Yes - I got all your e-mails. Very cute. Are you ever going to say anything, or will I just continue to receive enigmatic and virtually anonymous messages forever?  Kate 
 Yes, this should be a purchase, and I've changed it. Thanks for your alert!  Kate 
 Prebon is right on this. Both deals are 25 MW. They've been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 This is done. Let me know if it shows up in your report.  Kate 
 So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.  Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.  So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.  Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?  I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.  Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.  Kate 503-288-6546 
 Whoo-hooo! 
 I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the index prices in order to run one of her reports.  I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. (I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's what I heard back from Tim. Do you want me to go ahead and save the Dow Jones data to a shareable file in the meantime?  Kate 
 I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know and I'll add you to the mailing list.  And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll let you know as soon as it's done.    Thanks, Kate 
 I'm sorry - I have no idea who Christer is - I'm assuming Chris Foster? Also, we have two Bill Williams - I assume you mean the real time manager, Bill Williams III. Let me know if I'm right, and I'll be happy to add them to the mailing list.  Thanks, Kate 
 I don't see a deal number.....? Is it a missing deal? 
 The expiry should be 2003, and it's been changed. Thanks for catching that.  Kate 
 This should be 214.00 - I've changed it.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/22/2001 01:50 PM 
 Jeff double-checked and Deal 459985 is with PGET.  Mike is checking on the others. 
 He checked with broker - it's $132 - it's changed.  K 
 Thank you, Evelyn.  K 
 I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.  Kate 
 Thanks, Neil. They're on the mailing list now. And yes, it's hard to believe there are not one but TWO William Williams in our office.  Kate 
 This deal has been changed to reflect beginning of Daylight Savings Time - now has total of 95,100 MW - down from 95,200.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've started to transfer my Dow Jones e-mails into five separate folders which can be found at:  P:\Scheduling\Dow Jones - Cob\Mead\Mid-C\NP-SP\Palo  You can already access February's files for each of these delivery points, and prior months will be coming in soon as I have free moments in the day.  Thanks, Kate 
 I would like to request information and application materials for your International Studies program in Bologna. I am interested in applying for the academic year of 2002-03.  Thank you, Kate Symes 2505 NE 32nd Place Portland,OR 97212 (503) 288-6546 
 I came, I saw, I viewed.....and now I will eat. Thanks for the update, Grace!  Kate 
 I would like to request information and application materials for your advanced studies program in Bologna, Italy, as well as for Master's Degree study in international relations at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in applying for the academic year of 2002-2003, but I'd like to gather all the necessary information as soon as possible.  Thank you,  Kate Symes 2505 NE 32nd Place Portland, OR 97212 
 We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the form we need.  Under the "Sort By" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two choices - "Deal #" and "Desk." As I run it now, the report displays megawatt volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data according to delivery point.  Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.  Thanks in advance for your help on this.  Kate 503-464-7486  Cara 503-464-3814 
 You're right, this was an Altra deal that was entered as Prebon. Only one deal.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/15/2000 02:41 PM 
 Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:  Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7. Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports - All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR) All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 980362/983837/987050 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE  Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.  Thank you, Kate 503-464-7486 
 Natsource is right - it's been changed to 263.00  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/23/2001 12:28 PM 
 Go for it! 
 All Matt Motley's deal JUST went in, so you should see those coming through.  Chris Mallory checked with Prebon - this is a sale - it's been changed.  Diana checked Bloomberg - they show 25 mw and so do we for a total of 800 mw....?? 
 I'm trying to locate Matt right now to verify - but he has two identical trades with TFS in his trade log. I'll let you know when I find out.   Stephanie Piwetz   02/23/2001 01:24 PM 
 Just heard from Matt - should only be one trade - I've killed 530557.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/23/2001 01:24 PM 
 Can I come at 10 a.m. please?  Thanks, Kate 
 Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal as soon as risk is done with their calc.  Kate 
 I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume reports. He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now, but has requested it from staff at the exchange. He's not sure of the exact day he might begin receiving this report, but told me it would be sometime next week. I'll let you know when I find out.  Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.  Thanks, Kate 
 I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a "natural healer" and he's also had "an experience with Jesus," so this one should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired this week that I've been spouting out sentences like "The red computer needs to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong." It's definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. Hang in there - and call me soon!  Love, Kate 503-288-6546 
 The delivery point was changed and the energy wasn't. It is CAISO energy.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks for the reminder - deal is changed and note is in comments section.  Kate 
 It's been changed - thanks for catching that.  Kate 
 Did you ever receive this signed confirm letter?  Kate 
 She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/26/2001 01:32 PM 
 Broker is correct - it's been changed.  Kate 
 You're right - thanks for checking up on us. This deal was actually done this morning before Credit came out with the updated watchlist. He checked with Tracy Ngo, our credit person, on the deal and she's aware of and okay with it. I guess Bob snuck one in there!  Thanks, kate 
 Done.  Kate 
 No problem. It occured to me, as the list of people I'm sending this to continues to grow, that maybe I should fine tune the format a little. If you guys have any suggestions about the layout of the spreadsheet, please let me know.  Thanks, Kate    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Just something to keep in mind - The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant County for the following three deals -  432854 420554 420563  I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.  Thanks, Kate 
 It was under wrong broker - 531847 has been changed to reflect Prebon as broker.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike Driscoll went in and changed this deal to match 458405. It should be correct now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Deal had no broker - 531846 has been changed to reflect APB as broker.  Thanks, Kate 
 So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.  How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through "alternative" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning.  As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in bed.  Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by the time he calls.  Kate 
 The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute them. So this includes term deals that are marked "no confirm." Please let me know if this is okay with you.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed on this. Please let me know how I can help.  Thanks, Kate 
 This deal was constructed by Holli Krebs in mid-marketing - she just put it under Bob's desk and trader i.d. She should be in the office shortly, and I'll have her look over the changes made to the deal. I'll get back to you soon.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   02/27/2001 06:34 AM 
 The NYMEX calendar shows that West Option expire on 9/24 - Prebon may be looking at the Futures expiry date. But it should be 9/24.  Kate 
 Prebon is right - this has been changed to 205.50.  Kate 
 I'm not finding anything in Enpower that matches that deal number. Is it something else? 
 The counterparty name saga continues.... 
 Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then feel free to change away!  Thanks, Kate 
 This is the last e-mail I received from Laura. Looks like she forgot the attachment the first time. 
 Disregard my other reply - I don't know what I was thinking. Prebon was right on this. Both deals were 50 MW (not 25 MW like I said earlier!), and they were changed accordingly.  Sorry about the confusion.  Kate 
 Did you want this deal confirmed? If so, it needs a counterparty contact name in it. Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it should be confirmed.  The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?  Kate 
 530608 - CDWR - Bob Floyd @ (916) 574-2768 531786 - Metro Water of SoCal - Jim Danielson @ (213) 217-6673  This should be the contact information in GCP. If it's not in there, let me know and I'll have it added.  Thanks, Kate 
 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy  WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. "I know energy is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but other than that, I'm in the dark," Abraham said. "I was hoping to be appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but that one was already taken." The former Michigan senator said he plans to go to the library Thursday to look up "Energy" in The World Book Encyclopedia. 
 I just spoke with Justin Rostant, who reported that ICE will begin sending him data tomorrow morning. So you can expect the ICE volumes to be included on tomorrow's EOL report. Let me know if you have any other specifications for the report.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm so sorry, gals, but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold once and for all!  Thanks, Kate cell phone (503) 819-2181 
 I'm feeling pretty under the weather today, so I'm going to sneak out of here early - but I haven't yet received the Dow Jones data for today. Instead, I'm sending yesterday's information. If you need today as well, let me know and I'll send it first thing in the morning.    Thanks, Kate 
 I've added the contact name of Alicia Izarraraz.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here they are, just in case....  Kate 
 Looks like Mike Driscoll's Deal Blotter defaults were wrong - this has been changed to firm energy.  Kate 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I'm still learning and it seems every few minutes we face another computer program meltdown. Following are the changes for these deals.  459985 PGET  459788 Salt River couldn't take the deal, according to Mike Swerzbin, so we had to go with Williams.  459789 Changed to PSCO  460001 Prebon is broker  460002 Term is Q1-01  458618 SCEM 25 MW of Mid-C Off Peak for Dec. @ $100 This deal was entered yesterday, according to Mike Swerzbin.  Thanks for your patience, Kate 
 same as 532917 
 This was changed last night to SP-15, but Jeff forgot to change the index. It's been changed to DJ SP-15 Peak Index.  Kate 
 Sharen had already alerted me to the first deal, which I changed, but not the second. That deal has been changed as well now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today. I've spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday. Deal number is 533916. Thanks for waiting.  Kate 
 Reminder.... 
 I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker know to change the delivery point on the confirm.  Thanks, Kate 
 Done. 
 Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?  Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match trade date on confirmation letter?  Thanks, Kate 
 Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who didn't notice it. Weird, huh!  Thanks for checking though.  Kate 
 I'd like to talk to you about the details of my offer letter if you have a chance today. I'll stop by your desk in just a bit.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here are a few examples of the summary I send out each afternoon. I've sent four as attached documents and one just pasted into the e-mail. Use whichever works best for you, and let me know if you need more.      Thanks, Kate 
 no problem! 
 Broker is right - deal has been changed to 230 
 Tom Alonso - deal entered wrong - 534494 is corrected to show sale now. 
 Chris just checked with broker - they have it wrong - should be NP-15. 
 Verified with Diana and Sean - these should be APB.  and the Williams deal should be resolved - deal # is 534497 
 Sure - no problem. 
 Yes - it's a Puget deal. I'm trying to contact Sean right now to see if he and Diana overlapped on these deals. I only see them written once in his trade log, but I'm auditing the second two to find out who entered them. 
 Sean and Diana just returned - found out they had doubled up on those puget deals - i'm killing 534496 and 534497 right now. 
 sorry - confusion - tom alonso had the williams deal with APB down as a purchase, but he's changing it to a sale just in the interest of checking out now. Deal # is 534492 
 Sorry Sharon. I just entered this deal for Matt Motley, and my deal entry defaults to all days. This is a peak deal and should only flow Monday through Saturday, hours 7-22. It's been changed to reflect that.  Thanks, Kate 
 534492 has been changed back to buy from williams through APB 
 I'm sorry - I have record of sending those volumes on Monday. I was out sick yesterday. I'll be sending them in just one moment.  Kate 
 Option terms are not reflected in the system. Trade date has been changed to 2/22 - reflects trade date in CDWR confirmation letter. I've left a copy of the confirm letter on your desk just in case. Let me know if you have questions.  Kate 
 Sorry for the delay - 
 I'm sorry, but your superior and omnipotent ruler, Bill, has asked that I copy all of his mignons on this e-mail. So I really don't care whether or not you care. Print it out and line your birdcage.  K 
 wait - i thought you weren't going to go there on corporate e-mail. where did this sudden attack come from? that's low - especially considering i'm deathly ill but still slaving away at work to band-aid the mistakes you guys spend all day making. and you are sadly mistaken in the rumors you've heard - i've never endeavored upon anything with anyone. my birdcage, if i had one, would be lined with your e-mails.  K 
 Beginning tomorrow this report will contain Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) trade numbers and volumes, in addition to EOL and brokered deal information. Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail. Also note that the ICE data is released one day later, so it will not correlate directly to the EOL data below it. (i.e. Daily EOL Summary 3/1 will include ICE data from 2/28) Enjoy... 
 Diana stepped out of the office for a minute, but I left the e-mail printout on her desk and I'll talk to her about it when she gets in.  Kate 
 Diana just told me that these deals are NOT supposed to be confirmed. She's taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if you'd like to speak to Diana directly.  Kate 
 This has been changed. 
 I've put a call in to Mike Driscoll to see which deal is correct. He "fixed" them yesterday, but frankly I have no idea what he really did, as they still look completely different. As soon as I confirm with him, I'll change the deals and let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 do you mean you changed it to PPT - it looks like that's what's in there already... 
 It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone. But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone. Could you check your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?  Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone: 534074 534072 534071 534053  Thanks, Kate 
 Will you be sending confirm letters on these Modesto deals, or just verbally confirming them? Could you let Sharen or myself know so we can get something on record with the Confirms group in Houston?  Thanks, Kate 
 I've forwarded this e-mail onto Diana and asked her to let you or me know what the status is on these confirm letters. We'll be in touch.  Kate 
 Tom said he spoke with his broker at APB and someone in Houston this morning - this was a good deal and he entered it. I'm doing a search right now for the deal number. Do you need that? 
 Deal number is 535228. 
 done. 
 Food for thought.... 
 should be Prebon - i'm changing it now 
 535144 - Enron sells to Duke - in system incorrectly as APB but has been changed.  And Chris is just finishing deal entry now - he has the mirant sale with Prebon. 
 It is with Natsource - part of a sleeve that Mike forgot to write down.  Thanks, Kate 
 Can you forward this information along to Kimberly in the Confirms group? Thanks so much.  Kate 
 Bob's out of the office now, but I'll check with him in the morning. This very well could be the correct delivery point, but thanks for checking. I'll get back to you.  Kate 
 Thanks for setting that up, Cara. I'll begin plugging the numbers directly in there.  Kate

 These have been changed to Firm energy.  Kate 
 Has Chris sent you a list, or do you still need one? (I sit facing these guys, so it would only take me a second to come up with one.)  Kate 
 When you guys do loss return deals like this one with PGE, could you include a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and "no confirm" status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 Would you let me know when you might have a minute today, or sometime this week, to go over the EES spreadsheet with me? I want to understand how the Real Time group uses this data so I can depict it more accurately and avoid making errors.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks! 
 This has been changed. 
 Please note slight changes in volumes at SP-15 on 2/5 and 2/22. Cuts were made to generation on these days, and deals were changed in EnPower, but this spreadsheet was not updated. Sorry for the delay....  Kate 
 Spreadsheet has been updated and sent to Neil Bresnan, Daniel Kang, and Jubran Whalan at EES. Thanks for your help on this.  Kate 
 Energy type is Firm in EnPower - is this correct? Counterparty seems to disagree. Please let me know when you get a chance.  Kate 
 I've forwarded both these e-mails to Tom. He's in a trading meeting right now, but we'll clear up the energy type when he gets out.  Kate 
 This deal also has firm energy while the counterparty says non-firm....? 
 Tom says this deal was firm energy, but it is transmission contingent. When Tom did the deal with FPL, he said he wouldn't buy it unless the energy was firm. The power has already been delivered, however, so Tom said it shouldn't matter what kind of energy the confirm has, so for the sake of getting it done, he said just to agree with what they have in their confirmation. Does that make any sense? And the same goes for deal 516506.  He is still disputing the price (where Enron shows $90 and FPL shows $95 in deal 517520), and he's expecting a call back from Jeff Wallace on that.  Thanks, Kate 
 All of these have been changed to CAISO energy and respective traders have been notified.  Thanks, Kate 
 All deals with NP-15 or SP-15 delivery points should use CAISO energy.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, deal should have zero volume. Looks like Jeremy just didn't have time to kill it so he zeroed it out. I'll kill it, but in the meantime, it's not a real deal and doesn't need to be confirmed.  Thanks, Kate 
 I take that back - the deal contains liquidated strips and cannot be killed - that's why it's zeroed out. 
 Jeff knows he has several deals off right now. He's fixing them as we e-mail. 
 waiting for Mike to come back from off-site meeting - out of curiosity, 537949 is a light load deal - is that it? 
 left message with sean - he's in offsite meeting right now - his trade log says simply balance of the month deal. 
 537948 & 537949  Also, Mike says 537948 should definitely be ON PEAK. 
 Just heard from Sean - says it should be 3/7/01 through 3/31/01. 
 Please note:  Dow Jones and fixed price sales will now be depicted as positive numbers; positive variance indicates EES long position; negative variance indicates EES short position. Call me with questions.  Kate Symes 503-464-7486

 I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?  Kate   (From 2/26/01) Just something to keep in mind - The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant County for the following three deals -  432854 420554 420563  I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.  Thanks, Kate 
 Please note:  Prices were not updated in last night's spreadsheet. Correct prices are in 3/6 worksheet now. Also, per Daniel Kang, EES load is shown in negative numbers, Dow Jones and fixed price sales are shown in positive numbers. Please call with questions.  Thanks, Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 Have you received any of these - I had notified Holli of four total missing confirm letters.  Kate 
 Done. 
 Thanks for checking. I entered this deal today and am still getting used to all the different variations of company names. You're right - it's El Paso Merchant.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike said to just enter a new deal with these terms - deal is 539032, and I've backdated the trade date to 3/1. He's going to double-check the EES spreadsheet to make sure he didn't miss something. In the meantime, the deal is in there now.  Thanks, Kate

 Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. Please call me with questions.  This spreadsheet includes a missing purchase for total of 55 mw @ 195.00 on 2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.   This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 on 2/6.    In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.  Thanks, Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 Voila! Have fun.... 
 Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to them.  Kate

 Mike just got back to me on this - these are good deals that he forgot to write down. I'm entering them right now, and I'll let you know the deal numbers in a second.  Kate 
 539859 - buy PGET 539861 - sell EES 
 It's been changed - sorry. 
 I will be attending an Energy Math training session today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST. Please direct all correspondence to traders whose deals are in question. I'm sorry for the inconvenience - but hopefully I'll be smarter when I come back!  I'll check in and wrap things up at 5:00, so if you have any questions you'd like to save for me, I'll be at my desk then.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm having Diana look into it - I'll let you know.  Kate 
 She changed it to price 360.00  Thanks, Kate 
 I know - it's amazing that in this age of technological wizardry we are forced to resort to some of the cheesiest hijinks known to man. Of course, if I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner.  Love, Kate 
 They've been added - thanks for reminding me.  Kate 
 I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however you'd like. We'll talk.  Kate 
 Yes - I've added it. 
 Have fun with these! 
 Okay, I don't know where Jeff's head was today, but he just checked with Prebon and found he had done this deal without even knowing it! So he entered it - Deal #461171.  Thanks a lot for your patience, Stephanie.   Stephanie Piwetz   11/16/2000 02:32 PM 
 Following are the deals we've changed -  536574 - from Firm to Caiso energy 537885/886/888/889/890 - from Yes to No confirm  And I'm looking into the status of the price on 538874. I'll let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike still has about 6 deals to put in, and those are two of them. It should just be a minute.  I'm killing a deal right now so my deal entry is tied up - who's the trader on 541368? 
 I'm killing deal 539968 at Sharon Cason's request - it was previously killed and she needed me to reinstate it so she could sort out the confirm. Then I had to re-kill it. 
 broker is right - this is changed to DYPMI 
 broker is right - changed to Coral 
 541226 - changed to APB 
 Amerex Sean just entered this deal - he says it's with Transalta, not TranCanada. Mark's deal should have been APB - it's changed.  Prebon Mike missed this deal - I just entered it - 541616 
 Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Fran - It looks like you either made changes or added legs to this deal today. Do they need to reconfirm this? Please let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm killing it now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Tom Alonso's deal has been entered - Deal #461177 
 Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.  Kate 
 It looks like only leg 4 had firm energy - I changed that to CAISO. Legs 2 and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?  Kate 
 okay - cool. 
 Questions about this deal -  1. Should energy type be CAISO? 2. Should trade date be 3/7? 3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?  I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the confirmation status.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm losing my mind. Did I already forward this note to you? Do you still need the confirmation information? I can print out whatever they have stored in Livelink, or you can contact Stephanie - it looks like she has what you were searching for.  Thanks, Kate 
 are they sweets of any kind? 
 you're kidding! that's ludicrous! what exactly is there? 
 I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 ludicrous = amusing or laughable through obvious absurdity, incongruity, exaggeration, or eccentricity  what is lexic?  and, oh my god, is it andy's birthday today? 
 To re-cap: I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.  Kate 
 Re: missing APB deal  tom a buying koch 20-30 25 mw 114.00 palo on peak  Tom Alonso just returned my call and verified that he had entered the deal. Jeff Richter had entered it, thinking it wasn't in the system, so I'm now killing his deal. The correct deal number is 461133.  Thanks a lot. 
 Mark's missing deal - 542424 - in at 50 mw. Mark said Pinnacle and he both know the deal as 50 mw - Prebon mistake.  K 
 what was the trade date on this? 
 this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or not it's a good trade.  thanks, Kate 
 This deal is in under Short Term California, not Long Term Northwest, and the trader is Phil Platter, not Mike Swerzbin, and there is no broker. Are you sure this is the deal in question?  Kate 
 Mike negotiated no broker fee on this - he just spoke to his broker and asked to have them stop asking for that.  Thanks, Kate  P.S. I know the feeling about needing a vacation - sooner rather than later! Hang in there! 
 This should be Amerex - Diana is changing it now. 
 in with wrong broker - changed 547680 and 547681 to APB 
 Prebon Mark Fischer Changed 547680/681 to APB  Chris Mallory 547716  Amerex Mark Fischer Killed 547637  Diana Scholtes Says 547287 is definitely only 25 mw 
 We think the broker's right - can't read Mark's handwriting - but I can't change the price until they're done with the calc - about 20 min. I'll let you know.  Kate 
 price has been changed to 207.50. 
 Bloomberg shows correctly. Computer defaulted to all days in Deal Blotter. I'll change this as soon as Risk is done calcing - about 1 hour.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/16/2000 03:18 PM 
 I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, I know it's not.  So how are things "down" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of '01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those perfunctory "news" stories begging the question, "Just how much will I ever care?" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the "urgency of the building's reconstruction" due to its "inability to be inhabited until 2003." Is it just me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?  Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.  I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling pieces of crumbling buildings.  Kate 
 Did you already settle this with Les? It looks like the deal is only flowing M-S, on peak hours. Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Bob - Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through Cal'09.  I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions regarding that time frame.  Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.  Kate 
 Mary Hain said she would get the paperwork going on this master agreement. Either Mary or I will be in touch to let you know when this is in place.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've been keeping track of this with Tracy Ngo, our credit gal, and the last thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a deal is "pending credit approval" it's a little vague as to when the decision will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top of it and let you know this afternoon.  Thanks, Kate 
 Done.  K 
 Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Prebon Sean Crandall 549048 - changed to NP  Diana Scholtes Prebon broker said our price (215) and del. point (Cob) are right  Jeff Richter 549013 - changed to APB  549010 - enron buys BP/Apr01/NP/peak/207.00 (in with Amerex - should it be Prebon?)  Chris Mallory - just entered Williams deal 
 chris - just finished entering deals  jeff - 549013 - changed to APB from Prebon  548756 - changed to 82.52 
 Just confirmed with Mike. Broker is correct - 25 MW. I'll change this deal when Risk is done with their calculation.  Thanks, Kate 
 Natsource is going to have to give you a trader name on this because I've asked all of them and nobody recognizes it.  Kate 
 This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought they were the same....???  Kate 
 Sorry - Sean just changed this deal from Mid-C to NP-15. I've changed the energy to CAISO.  Thanks, Kate 
 Then I guess we can safely say that Jeff is in la-la land.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thank you! I was so baffled for a minute there - when I said "April option" every trader just looked at me like I was crazy!  Kate 
 It's been changed to Prebon.  Kate 
 549052 - del. point is already in as Mid-C, so just the price is wrong? 
 Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.  Thanks, Kate 
 Okay, that makes more sense. I've left a big note on Sean's desk and I'm watching the door of the meeting for him to come out.  Kate 
 We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if Prebon still disputes.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed. 
 Note to Real Time desk: EES sent over revised volumes for delivery at SP-15 after I sent the spreadsheet out today. Please disregard the variance volumes for that delivery point.

 Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!  I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain "lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania" anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!  Love, Kate 
 Okay - let me know if you need anything later.  Kate 
 Yep - the strips are changed to reflect term 3/15 to 3/31. Glad that's finally solved!  Thanks, Kate 
 Sean Crandall changed the term of it during last night's checkout with Prebon, but forgot to change the strip in the deal. It's fixed now to reflect a term of 3/15 to 3/31.  Thanks, Kate 
 Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't run into anymore deals that won't save due to blank deal entry fields. If you do, though, please let Dave or me know and we'll look into it further. You should now be able to add to the deal clearing tab and save the deal.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Transmission deals go through Arizona Public Service, not APS Energy Services. This deal has been changed. Let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 It should be Arizona Public Service. I guess the CTPY name just changed, so Ryan was a bit confused. I talked with Bill Williams about it and forwarded the message on to both of them. Deal has been corrected.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually good-looking farm workers.Tres important!  So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it.  The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....  I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back soon.  Kate

 yes we do - it's been changed.  thanks, kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/14/2001 03:14 PM 
 How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre, like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on.  And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything pisses her off. Gotta love it.  So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point. I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have my happy little family.....  Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose, which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?  Love ya, Kate 
 I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you think of it later, you might ask.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/14/2001 03:36 PM 
 This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can save your part.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a problem. And you're right - that's not bad at all!  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed both strips to reflect 3/16-3/31.  Thanks, Kate 
 I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or is there another deal number?  Thanks, Kate 
 okay, this deal has been changed to CAISO.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed. 
 Another trivial counterparty name change - it's Enmax Energy Corp., not just plain old Enmax Corp. These deals have been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals have been changed to reflect the correct counterparty name, and I've forwarded the message to the real time traders who did the deals and their manager. Thanks for the heads up!  Kate 
 Sorry Rhonda - I forgot to also send this message on to you!  Kate 
 550042/550048 - changed to yes confirm - entered by Real Time guy who isn't in the habit of day-ahead trade settings  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed both of these deals to be confirmed, since we're confirming all daily trades now. Just wanted to let you know.  Kate 
 whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs (it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word "owner" underneath. do you think that means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them "employee owners"? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you.  kate 
 You shouldn't be sorry about the fact that you need help.  K    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 yeah - mike is entering all his deals now. 
 changed to pinnacle west - and you might mention to apb, if you feel like it, that it would save their time during checkout if they told tom the correct counterparty when the trade was done - he said apb never seems to know whether it's APS or pinnacle, but for his part he doesn't mind which counterparty it's with - anyway, just fyi...  thanks, Kate 
 I'll have Dave Poston fix it and get back to you.  Kate 
 I think number 5 especially applies to you boys. 
 Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you posted if anything else comes up.  Thanks, Kate 
 551260 - changed to 227  And I'm entering Jeff's deals right now - he went into a meeting and neglected to finish deal entry!  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 551764    Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:51 PM 
 You should see all of these deals in the system - he just entered them. Let me know if something doesn't show up, or if you need deal numbers.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 changed to no confirm - 542401/542393/542396  kate 
 p.s. 551260 has been changed to 227.00 - what a mistake that would have been!   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 Please note volume changes in SP-15 fixed price sale, 3/17, HE 15 and 16. 
 Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner" of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you didn't notice that.  Kate 
 this has been changed to firm - thanks for catching it.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 07:43 AM 
 The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.  Thank you, Kate 
 The deals were entered yesterday -  461029 Williams  461030 EES  Thanks 
 I've changed all three deals to firm energy.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 10:33 AM 
 Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:  Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi  Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me know if you need more information.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Here's the procedure for adding new traders to the system. I've requested to have Paul Choi's name added - Greg Wolfe and the rest of the mid-marketers appear to already be in there.  Kate 
 Mike's still entering his deals - they should be showing up momentarily. 
 552673 - changed to sell  Missing trades should be in now. Let me know if they're not.   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 12:32 PM 
 Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will potentially do deals with all of the traders -  Long Term Southwest Long Term Northwest Long Term California Long Term West Management  Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Kate    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 yes, he's still inputting. 
 Just constantly adding value, aren't we..... 
 It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile - if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your help.  Kate    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I'd love to receive all three publications by e-mail.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the latest version. Sound better? 
 I just talked with Mike, and he thinks this trade was made on the 14th, but possibly entered on the 15th and back-dated. He's coming in to the office in a few minutes and will call the broker to be sure. I'll let you know as soon as they've worked it out.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/17/2000 08:31 AM 
 I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.  Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first. So for the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great Gatsby in my possession.  Kate 
 I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Dave, Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just holler over here whenever you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate 
 553809 - changed to APB 553810 - changed to APB  554166 - changed to BP Energy Co.  Jeff is entering the rest of his deals right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/19/2001 02:26 PM 
 Jeff is still entering deals. 
 Thanks - I guess the computer defaults were set wrong and a few deals were entered with incorrect BOM dates. They've been corrected.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/19/2001 03:21 PM 
 Here are the deals we changed to the correct balance-of-the-month term (3/21/01 to 3/31/01):  554245 554253 554252 554257  Thanks, Kate 
 You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete in that category. Especially not at the end of a long day. Of staring. At this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour to decide.....  K 
 Our fax number is 503-464-3740. You can send those deal numbers over whenever you get a chance, and I'll look them over and talk to the appropriate traders and IT. Thanks so much for your diligence during this transition. I'll keep you informed on the IT effort.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed deal 547478 to reflect the correct price - $109.90 off peak and $174.15 on peak - and made a note in our deal correction report. Please keep me informed on any discrepancies you run across. I'll be happy to look into it.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike has 25 MW with no broker fee in his trade log. I just spoke with him and he's going to call Natsource to confirm this. But this deal should be correct as it is in the system.  Thanks, Kate 
 550480 has been changed to Merrill per Sean Crandall  550383 and 550385 - I'm still waiting to hear from Mike Driscoll on these - I'll let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 those dummies! (it's changed back)  Thanks, Kate 
 550383 and 550385 have been changed to Nevada Power per Mike Driscoll.  Kate 
 I've spoken with Rhonda about this, and I'll be letting the traders know to be prepared for the change. This deal has been changed to Allegheny.  Thanks, Kate 
 Tom's in a meeting, but in his trade log he has APS crossed out and over it he's written Pinnacle. So I'm going to wait to find out what happened. I'll let you know.  Kate 
 Traders are finishing up a meeting and Mike has his trade log with him. I'll let you know in a second. 
 mike says 555403 is Q3-02 - it's been changed but  he thinks 555404 should be Jul-02, not Q3-02 - is Natsource broker sure? 
 555410 has been changed to Q4-02, and Mike's still entering deals. 
 it's changed. 
 555159 has been changed to APS. 
 These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. (This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!  Thanks, Kate 
 sorry - we changed the year and just changed each strip - but since it was originally entered in deal blotter it had those extra strips and, long story short, it should be right now.  thanks Kate 
 i'm having deal blotter and deal entry problems - please bear with me while i try to change this, but it might be a minute.  Thanks, Kate 
 he's wrong - mike just checked with his broker, who should correct it. 
 chris says both of these prices are correct - is broker still disputing them? 
 I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right term and volume now.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.  Thanks, Kate 
 Will -  I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.  Kate 
 Cheers?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what you're doing say, "I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A BISCUIT." And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of advice for the day)  Kate 
 Don't get defensive. I was just worried you had picked up another silly affectation.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks a lot, Kim! 
 yes....yes it does.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Good morning -  Just wanted to let you know that I've been running the stage version of the Forward Obligation report using production data, and I seem to be getting all the same numbers as I do with the production version of the report. I will continue to compare the two today when I run these reports, just to make sure. But in the meantime, all looks well. Thanks for your help.  Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I left a note for Jeff last night, and apparently he already changed the deals to reflect APB's price 554905 is $350 554912 is $325  Kate 
 The following deals have been autoscheduled for 2/1/01  556553 556561  Let me know if this comes through on your report.  Thanks, Kate 
 it's been changed to M-S 
 556890 - changed to M-S (jeremy's mask was wrong) 556515 - mike swerzbin says this is definitely a peak deal - let me know what amerex says  Kate 
 couldn't "doll" be classified as harassment in the workplace...... 
 you think people are really fooled by your innocent facade? 
 Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.  The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.  The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III and me.  I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal numbers.  461029 Williams 115.00  461030 EES 114.95  461801 Mieco 115.00  461802 EES 114.95  And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. Confusion!  Hope this fixes it. 
 Melissa - I just wanted to let you know that I can definitely get this list to you today. I'm a little buried right now dealing with some IT issues we're having with the new Full Service Power application, Forward Obligation report, etc., etc., so it may take me a little while. Is it okay if I get this to you by 1 p.m. PST? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write back....if you can still move your fingers.  Sincerely, Kate (the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look constantly busy) 
 It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?  Thanks, kate 
 And thanks for your hard work, too! I've been checking the new version agains production data today and it looks good to me as well. I'm sorry I haven't been more actively involved - I've been drowning in a new version of the EOL report and this new FSP application. So thanks for being in correspondence with the guys in Houston.  Kate 
 No - they pay you just for being you! 
 558066 - I see 367 in this deal  557412 - Mallory's deal changed to Bloomberg  Sean is entering last two deals. 
 changed to Bloomberg 
 I'm so sorry - 557552 (I was looking at that deal and trying to write at the same time - oops!) 
 This deal is in - 558076 - but it's with Matt Motley's book. 
 558176 - he just entered it 
 Thanks for checking. I changed this deal to reflect off-peak hours only.  Also, Tom Alonso just let me know that deal #460678 actually has a Mid-C delivery point, not Palo Verde. I changed this as well, but wanted to let you know so you can re-confirm.  Thanks, Kate 
 Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.  Kate 
 I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can do to assist.  West Power Traders Tim Belden Matt Motley Mike Swerzbin Mike Driscoll Bob Badeer Sean Crandall Diana Scholtes Tom Alonso Mark Fischer Jeff Richter Chris Mallory Jeremy Morris Phil Platter  Again, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online. Our other groups - mid-marketing, origination, and fundamentals - do not trade online. I believe that development in San Francisco also does not trade online.  Thanks, Kate 
 After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Happy reading! 
 These have been approved and auto-scheduled.  Kate 
 Details in exchange for this -  I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges since last spring: "We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'" The lead of the story was this: "The California Independent System Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since last May."  First of all, tell me what the difference is between "overcharges" and "excessive" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically unattractive.  Then you get details.  Kate 
 I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word "stunning" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in his/her story.  But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.  There was no date.  Kate 
 Wow - what a nice Friday morning surprise to hear from my old friend Bobby. We must go back, what, at least half a year? Hey, it's no fun around our house with you being a stranger and all. We're having people over for a barbeque tonight - come by! Call me at work - 464-7486 - or catch someone at home later - 288-6546. We have to celebrate the beginning of spring, and you're not exempt. Have a super day at work. Talk to you later?  Kate 
 Hey! I'm so brain dead this morning I didn't even notice. But I'm sooooo glad you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel like a proud mother. Thanks for letting me know.  Kate 
 550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from EPMI to EES (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less than weighted average, making it $177.27)  552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices reflected in my worksheet Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals they've done on EES's behalf.  Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss it person to person.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 You rock, Angela! Don't worry, I'll be my usual quiet and unassuming self when I come by for lunch. Although, if you guys are having hotdogs, doesn't that mean that everyone pre-ordered? That would leave me "sans hotdog," which would be tragic. Let me know.  Kate 
 That's hilarious! My theme song for life is "Don't go breaking my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee, which incidentally has always been one of my favorites. I remember first hearing it on a Disney special where Elton did a duet with Minnie Mouse. What a kick! Thanks.  Kate 
 Hey Anna - you're a kook! I just got this from mom like two seconds ago! But thanks..... 
 BLOOMBERG Matt Motley 559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358  Tom Alonso 559010 - price is changed to $160 He is still entering last two deals.  AMEREX Mike Swerzbin 559062 - buys AEP, 25 mw, Cal-02, PV, $140 And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were correct.   Thanks, kate 
 I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there were two deals. ????  Kate 
 That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. Mike's exact words were, "there's no way it's $258." So if anyone from Prebon is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.  Thanks, Kate 
 503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.  Kate 
 Find out what your theme song is - it only takes a second. And keep in mind it could be something extremely fitting like Todd's - "My Boyfriend's Back." 
 just added - 559276 
 I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.  534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 mw per hour  559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak hours 559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak hours  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.  Thanks for your patience, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Thanks, chica. 
 Original...original...original. 
 The last two LTNW deals - 349864 and 318870 are changed to correct time zones. They gave me the option to choose "no" for rerouting of schedules. They were both EOL deals.  Kate 
 Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....  I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with "us." I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have to go. I'll call you tonight!  Take care, kate 
 It's been changed. Thanks!  Kate 
 Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, kate 
 I just got your fax - thank you! I'll start changing over those deals right now, so it shouldn't be long. I'll send you another e-mail when they're all done.  Kate 
 I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been fixed. Thanks for clarifying this.  Kate 
 The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have to get in the habit of doing it.  Thanks again, Kate 
 Mike confirmed with Amerex that this deal was done on the 14th. They're going to change it.   Stephanie Piwetz   11/17/2000 08:31 AM 
 I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part of the time zone glitch?  Kate 
 I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me know if that sounds good.  Kate 
 Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:  1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask Jeff?  2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"  3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?  4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed deals as well?  Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. Thanks for your help!  Kate 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy - we have two new Real Time guys training at the same time. Scary!  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be specified as CAISO firm.  Thanks, Kate 
 517814 - added .0075 fee per Chris Mallory  535228 - I'm waiting for Tom's desk to settle down a bit - they're in the middle of trading.  Any idea why APB's just checking these deals out now? They're from the beginning of February. Just wondering.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her number is 703-853-3001.  I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said.  I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.  Kate 
 535228 - broker fee added per Tom Alonso 
 I've left a message for Jeff, but I can't seem to find him or his trade log anywhere. Until I hear back, I don't know anything about these deals. I'm sorry! I'll let you know as soon as I hear from him.  Kate 
 Looks like Mark already changed this to 3/28 to 3/31 - looks good to me. 
 Mike confirmed with Natsource this was a 25MW deal with no broker fee. 
 I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/26/2001 03:22 PM 
 I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 Kim - I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp? 552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?  And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be confirmed.   Diana - I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty. 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, Montana System, etc.), do we confirm? 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that I'm doing this right. Please let me know.  553666 553667 553668 555174 555175 555177 555178 556365 556366 556367 556368 557665 557666 557667 557668 557734 558952 558957 558958 558959 558960  Thank you both for all your help.  Kate 
 I just entered these deals and backdated them -  562162 - buy Duke 562164 - sell Calpine  Sorry about the delay.  Kate 
 Following are EPMI weighted average trade prices for Tues., March 27. After discussing this e-mail with my manager, we've decided to only send the information previously sent via fax. If you have any questions on individual deals, please don't hesitate to call.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for catching that. It should be good now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!  Kate 
 We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 PREBON Matt Motley 562635  Jeff Richter 562556  Jeff Richter 562546 - corrected to 25 mw  BLOOMBERG Mike Driscoll 562546 - Mike would like to keep this as Pinnacle for now because that is the true counterparty - Bloomberg's system has not been updated  Tom Alonso did not do this deal (he did a BUY  with the same terms)  Sean Crandall 562641 
 Mike Driscoll is entering this ICE trade right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 02:08 PM
