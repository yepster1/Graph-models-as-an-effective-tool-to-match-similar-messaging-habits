If you e-mail them back to me, I can enter them into the deals.  586090 - LADWP 586092 - EWEB 587312 - SRP 587314 - EWEB 587316 - EWEB  Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance.  Thanks, Kate 
 Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 no way! you look MUCH better than that! 
 These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!  Kate 
 Should have been CAISO - I changed it.  Kate 
 These volumes reflect Cal-ISO cuts. Fun! 
 She did teach me to answer SOMEONE'S questions, but I don't even know who SOMEONES is! She also taught me to embrace my rudeness.  K    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Now, is that any way to be treating a poor, unsuspecting beer? Didn't your mother teach you that grabbing is impolite?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 which book? and are you calling me a hen?  K 
 Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct counterparty names.  Kate 
 I'm so sorry! You must have this a standard response e-mail for misdirected messages. Thanks for the heads up.  Kate 
 It's been changed to SP.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct counterparty names.  Kate 
 sorry i didn't respond right away - I was looking for the deal, and I found it. 508437 is the number, I've changed it to APB for broker.  K 
 P.S. Tom had 509009 and 509010 in under wrong broker - they've been changed. 
 508786 has been changed to 50 MW.  509085 was just entered: Enron buys Duke 50 MW Cal-02 PV 135.00  K 
 These deals were in under Prebon - 509009/010 have been changed to APB.  Tom does not recognize last deal.  K 
 No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike just finished entering deals. Missing deals are:  509064 509063  Chris just changed 508224 to Prebon for broker.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty you're trading with?  We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between changing incorrect counterparty names!  Thanks, Kate 
 You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you know I'm not ignoring you.  Thanks, Kate 
 It's been changed to CAISO.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily correction log. Hopefully this will incite everyone to pay more attention to the counterparty names they choose.  Thanks again, Kate 
 Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, but our take is that these deals are separate.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.  Thanks, Kate 
 I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.  In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate 
 This is Mike Swerzbin's deal - he's finishing up entering deals right now.  Kate 
 Deal is 507436 - Sean forgot the broker - it's been added.  Thanks, Kate 
 I guess Paul Choi spoke with Melissa Murphy when she was up here and told her the language looked fine on this confirmation. He reiterated that, and I'll fax the initialed copy back to you.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/29/2001 10:58 AM 
 The contact name is Jack Wells, and his phone number is (281) 293-6030. Would you like me to enter this info into the deals?  Kate 
 I'm sorry - I totally spaced this one Friday afternoon. I did talk to Sean and he confirmed the price at 390.00. It's been changed. Thanks for the reminder.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/29/2001 07:28 AM 
 He hadn't mentioned it, but I'd love to meet with him as well. Just let me know when. And keep me up to date on the tomato happenings, will ya!  Kate 
 I can't believe you're leaving! I hope wherever you go next brings you joy and fulfillment, but you'll definitely be missed here. Thanks for all your help. Good luck!  Kate 
 Broker is right - deal has been changed.  By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.   Stephanie Piwetz   01/26/2001 02:25 PM 
 Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me good.  Thanks, Kate 
 This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa! 
 Broker is right - it's been changed. 
 This was under the wrong counterparty - it's 506051. 
 Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service Company." All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself. This should change sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. Let me know if you have any questions.  Kate 
 A Real Time guy mistakenly sold to Coral instead of using their established PGE transmission deal. 505750 has been killed and the transmission has been re-scheduled under deal #146517.  Kate 
 You're right - I've changed the deal to APS and e-mailed the Real Time group to let them know of this situation - they were unaware of the difference.  Thanks, kate 
 I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.  Thanks, Kate 
 FYI  Following are the exact definitions of each Dow Jones Index Price in which we participate. This was originally a question Stew had, but I thought it might be helpful for all of you to be able to reference. I'll keep a copy of these definitions at my desk as well.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which NCPA shortname they're choosing.  Kate 
 I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?  Kate 
 Deal that matches 505118 is in - #504970.  Thanks for waiting, Kate 
 505118 has been changed to 1/26 -1/27. Still checking on missing deal. 
 505118 & missing deal are Jeff Richter's - he's on a conference call and will get back to me in two minutes.  505223 has been changed to 300.00.  Kate 
 I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.  Kate 
 505434 - Killed.  505066 - Changed to APB.  505313 - Changed to APB. (505229 - Kept the same.)  Hope this all makes sense - for not trading much today these guys are screwing up left and right!   Stephanie Piwetz   01/25/2001 01:44 PM 
 This deal was in under the wrong broker - 505229 - it's been changed. 
 Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept "sticking it out another month" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we know, or would like to know.  It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think you'll know if Denver is really "your kind of town." In the meantime, just take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a habitat, but you get the picture.  Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk - away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as "Brian's Trip to Portland." It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew it.....constantly.  Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile "the rest of our lives" are slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, "Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans." Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.  Love, Kate 
 505425 & 505427 have both been changed to Tradition for broker.  505431 has been changed to Coral.  Kate 
 566424 and 566426 have been auto-scheduled - just FYI. And I'm still working on the others.  Thanks, Kate 
 Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.  Kate 
 Yes - I just changed the deal to reflect 0.01 broker fee.  Kate 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Grace, you should be a mid-marketer - you've got that supply and demand thing DOWN, girl! 
 Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone.  Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.  Talk to you soon, Kate 
 P.P.S. I just got Monica's number from Amber (for about the 30th time) and here it is: (303) 322-5035. Sorry that took so long. Call her now, though. She's excited to hear from you.  K 
 I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. Here it is:  Ext. 7486 Cell phone 819-2181  And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I figured I'd let you know before I forgot.  Thanks, Kate 
 PS - "Go Nuggets!" sounds like someone with a stutter saying "Go Nuts!" 
 Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.  I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this "Rocky Mountain High" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this "normal" guy. You've got to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration with candles.  Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.  Love, Kate 
 Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.  Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 499-3234. I hope this helps.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mark's changing deal 581615 to APB - he had it in with Bloomberg.  Thanks, Kate 
 It's an Amerex deal. I've changed it.  Kate 
 Diana Scholtes was the trader on these. She's not in today, but Sean Crandall said that a 1/8 trade date was okay. I've changed all the deals.  Kate 
 Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the original one and leave it at that.  Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no confirm"? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient.  NP-15 On Peak - $273.50 Off Peak - $204.43  SP-15 On Peak - $216.53 Off Peak - $189.35  Thanks, Kate 
 Joaner Boner - Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night. Wheeew!  Happy Sexy Body New Year, Kate 503.819.2181 
 Both deals have been changed.  Kate 
 Broker is correct - this has been changed.  kate 
 Bob is just entering these deals now.  Kate 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:  493989 Sell SCEM Jun-01 198.00 Mid-C  493988 Sell SCEM Jun-01 195.00 Mid-C  Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, they're good to go.  Thanks, Kate    Stephanie Piwetz   01/23/2001 01:14 PM 
 Thanks for ending that, John. I've added comments to reflect the change in the three legs in deal 597246, so we should be all set now.  Kate 
 Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom for Monday and Tuesday. I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.  587941 STCA sells 25 to STWBom 4/23/01 $231.23 PGE3  589743 STCA sells 25 to STWBom 4/24/01 $266.00 NP-15  Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday. Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.  Thanks, Kate 
 Apparently Jeff thought this had already been changed , and it hadn't - I just changed it.  Thanks, Kate 
 The following attachment contains fixed prices for EPMI Short Term California sales to EES for 1/24.    Call me, 503.464.7486, or Chris Mallory, 503.464.3823, with any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, these are two separate, but identical deals. Thanks for double-checking.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/22/2001 02:20 PM 
 Mike Swerzbin just checked out with broker. Only one deal changed.  502391 Mid-C  502392 Palo Verde 
 This deal has been changed to firm energy.  Kate 
 I added a fee of 0.0075 to this deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 Jeff had just noticed this mistake and changed CTPY to Sempra.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/22/2001 12:43 PM 
 This deal has been changed to MTWTFS, on peak hours. Mike Driscoll's mask in Deal Blotter was incorrect.  Thanks, Kate 
 You're all set. Just to confirm, these are the deals I've approved and auto-scheduled.  483074 - 12/21/00 471891 - 12/4/00 through 12/31/00  Let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Thanks, Kate 
 I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response - I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on these deals.  Kate 
 Chris is entering those deals right now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.  Thanks, Kate 
 We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this carefully....  SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak  NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak  If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell him to do the same.  Thanks, Kate 
 500534 Sell PSCO 25 mw Q4-01 PV 150.00 
 500380 will be changed after the calc.  500381 110.00 Q2-01 NP 25 mw Off peak 
 This trade is good, but entered late. Deal # is 500534. 
 500440 Buy Morgan 25 mw Mid-C Q2-01 214.00  500441 Sell Morgan 25 mw NP Q2-01 105.00 
 Mike is still entering his deals. These are good, and should be seen in the system momentarily.  Kate 
 Tom checked with APB and they recognize the trade. Are they not checking out correctly in the back office? 
 Re: 491609 - This is trade date 1/5/01. It's been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower because that would mess with the routing.  Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and I'll talk to Sean.  Thanks, Kate 
 It's been changed to CAISO energy.  Thanks, Kate 
 It's Matt Motley's deal, but all the traders just got out of a meeting, so they're still entering deals. It should show up any minute.  Kate 
 Just FYI - I believe you entered these deals on Jan. 16. What were you thinking? How long have you worked here? Can you say, "wrong counterparty name"? Also, why don't you have your own trader ID yet? Geez.  Sincerely, Kate  P.S. Don't worry - I corrected them for you. 
 These have been changed, and I sent an e-mail to our Real Time desk to remind them, once again, of the correct counterparty name.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill the deals.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/18/2001 11:50 AM

 I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours" heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and Holidays, round-the-clock hours.  My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them in Deal Entry.  Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure either way.  Thanks for your time, Kate 
 Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the meantime.  Kate 
 I think you're right, but the trader just took off for lunch. I'll check with him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary, then let you know when it's done.  Thanks, Kate 
 Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.  Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.  Kate "Viva bailar"* Symes *Does this mean "live dance" or "dance lives" or "my friend Viva likes the way you dance" or none of the above?

 I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.  Thanks for your patience, Kate 
 499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the meantime, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you know if anything else changes.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed to CAISO energy - thanks for catching that.  Kate 
 498837 has been changed to Natsource.  499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.  Kate 
 You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.  Let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon.  Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks, Kate 
 This question is a bit dated now, but I thought I'd run it by you to make sure it's been resolved. Sound familiar?  Kate 
 Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as they've worked out a revised confirmation.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/17/2001 08:53 AM 
 APB is correct. I've changed the deal.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sounds great - I'm thinking tomorrow or Wednesday night might be the best, but let me know what works for you. Glad you survived a weekend with the "lesser" of the journalistic species.  Talk to you soon, Kate 
 If you could go ahead and fax that to 503-464-3740, I'll have Mike take a look at it.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/17/2001 07:06 AM 
 Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their Livelink training.  I'll get back to you soon.  Thanks, Kate 
 How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so there's no point in explaining it.  Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting "pissed") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for $118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and I'll do the deal.  Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)  Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?  Love, Kate 
 497570 just added broker  497633 just added broker  497915 deal is entered correctly Buy PSCO 17th 25MW 200.00 Palo  Let me know if you still can't see this last one.  Thanks, Kate 
 Amerex is correct. Deal has been changed. 
 TFS broker checked out wrong. We just spoke with him and he said he had corrected it with the back office. Should be cleared up now.  Thanks, Kate 
 So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the "cash balance plan"? When I pull up my account information from the "Savings Plan" website, it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is not the retirement plan, what is?  I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I thought they were automatically given to me.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in advance for your time.  Kate 
 I just changed this to 50 MW. Mike Driscoll says he had already changed the deal, but must not have saved it. Sorry about that.  Kate 
 My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.  Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send another book along with it called "Liar's Poker." I just heard about it and it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.  No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come to her senses and quit being evil.  Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.  Kate  P.S. What the heck is your address anyway? 
 Kate Symes Student No. 569430668  1. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price.  2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 bottles of soda. b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction. c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I have 100 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 200 bottles of soda - I would need AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use.  3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of transportation.  4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers' choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds, indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them.  5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of by $12.50. b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2. c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50.  6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.) b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5 to 2.) c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to 1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster (rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.  7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96. -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P 53P = 210 P = 210/53 $3.96  The quantity is 188 textbooks. -10 + (50)(3.96) = 188 200 - (3)(3.96) = 188 188  b. The sticker price becomes $6.79. -10 + 50(P-3) = 200 - 3P -10 + 50P -150 = 200 - 3P 360 = 53P P = 360/53 $6.79  The market quantity stays at 188 textbooks.  c. The sticker price becomes $3.79. -10 + 50P = 200 - 3(P+3) -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P - 9 201 = 53P $3.79  Market quantity decreases marginally to 179 textbooks.  d. If the seller pays $3 per book in taxes, the seller charges $6.79 and receives $3.79 per book. If the buyer pays $3 per book in sales tax, the buyer pays $3.79 per book. The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax.  e. The government collects $564 ($3 tax times 188 books) in tax revenues for this set of terms.   8. a. The equilibrium price is $42. -10 + 5P = 200 5P = 210 P = 42  The market quantity is 200.  b. The sticker price becomes $210 - t. -10 + 5(P-t) = 200 -10 + 5P + 5t = 200 P = 210 - t  c. The government takes in a tax revenue of 200t. There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin. Therefore, consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax.  9. a. Affects supply; supply curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged will increase b. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged will decrease c. Affects supply: supply curve will decrease: price will and quantity exchanged will decrease d. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity exchanged will decrease e. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity exchanged will decrease f. Affects demand: demand curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged will increase g. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged will increase h. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity exchanged will increase 
 Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.  If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones.  Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.  Kate Symes West Desk Deal Control 503.464.7486 
 Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the agreement, let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Don't you mean Little Miss Grammar?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Possibly. And just for your information, I think that request was actually three sentences crammed into one, with a misspelling thrown in for good measure. Nice.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead and move this version to production.  Thanks for all the hard work.  Kate 
 Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's the deal....  488121 - no fee 488122 - other side of spread - FEE  495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso  495206 - no fee 495207 - other side of spread - FEE  If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry for the hassle.  Thanks, Kate 
 Amerex checked out incorrectly - Mike Driscoll just talked to the broker, who was aware of that and said they would re-check out. Let me know if he communicates this to his back office.  Thanks, Kate 
 287933 shows Sempra Energy Trading as the counterparty......? 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 This needs to be changed after the calc.  Kate 
 I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.  I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment on? Was it Avista that time too?  The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just let me know when you have a moment to talk.  Thanks, Kate 
 Looks like Amerex has this in as a peak deal. Bob shows off-peak, says Amerex is incorrect. Please let me know if they dispute.  Thanks, Kate 
 Both Mike Swerzbin deals were in incorrectly. We've changed them, and added the last deal for Matt Motley.  495106 Off Peak  495175 50 MW  Matt's deal should show up any minute.  Thanks, Kate 
 Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/11/2001 11:07 AM 
 What's the delivery point on those deals?   Stephanie Piwetz   01/11/2001 10:48 AM 
 Matt says this trade is definitely Q3-02. Let me know if Prebon still disputes.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working with you in the future.  Thanks, Kate Symes West Desk Deal Control 503.464.7486 
 This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we should be able to clarify this.  Thanks, Kate 
 This actually makes him look better.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.  I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the future?  Thanks, Kate 
 I just checked this deal in Audit Viewer and found that Bob had entered it this afternoon, then backdated it for 1/8. I was going to ask him about the delivery point just as you called him - sorry we crossed paths. Let me know if there is anything else.  Kate 
 This deal has been changed from Pinnacle West to Arizona Public Service Co.  Thanks, Kate 
 Bob's entering this deal late. I don't know if he was asleep before or what; but it should show up in the next minute or so.  Thanks, kate 
 Contact is Sue Stevens @714-765-4132. Sorry for the delay.  Thanks, Kate 
 493986 CTPY is Tractebel - this has been changed  Deal just entered #494361  Thanks, Kate 
 494092 Price is 174.00  494093 Price is 173.00  Deal just entered #494339  Sorry about our slacking!  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike Swerzbin says this deal is good - he's got it in his trade log as Natsource. ???  Kate 
 These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two deals; they're highlighted in red:  459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve) 459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)  457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve) 457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)  468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side) 468440 - no change (buy side)  And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Wait - do you mean 287238 and 287289? Or are we really talking about 487238 and 487239? I can't find 287289 in the system; but I want to make sure before making any moves that I'm looking at the right deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and get someone else's opinion.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate 
 Re: Note I left on your desk. Could you take a look at this deal when you get a chance?  Thanks, Kate 
 P.S. I changed this deal to FPL. 
 This deal was in as 492562, but with no broker. I added APB.  Thanks, Kate 
 You're right - I've changed this deal in Enpower.  Thanks, Kate 
 It looks like 491916 duplicated a strip contained in 491893. I spoke with Diana Scholtes, and she wanted to keep both deals, but she deleted the extra strip in 491893. Let me know if this works with Tacoma.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/09/2001 12:09 PM 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Missing deal was input under Matt Motley - 492135  491593 is Prebon - I'll change this after the calc.  492044 has been zeroes out - it was a duplicate of the same deal, which was done with APB.  Thanks, Kate 
 Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming party in a couple weeks.  As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite phrases are "baby" and "poppa" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with a significant other.  Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.  Kate 
 I just spoke with Bob, and he said he wasn't told about these trades, but to go ahead and enter them into the system. Can you tell me what the MW total per hour should be?  Thanks 
 They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Kate 
 Left message for Bob - I don't see these deals in his trade log, so I can't be sure whether or not they're good. Again, we'll have to wait for the trader and broker to verify this. 
 I just got a hold of Mike, who is aware of these deals but isn't positive on the prices. He's going to have to check with the broker on Monday to get it right. So as of right now these deals aren't in the system. I'm sorry about that.  Thanks, Kate 
 You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power & Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the correct counterparty name, though.  Thanks for the heads up, Kate 
 490801 Price is 122.45 It's been changed  490861 Broker is Amerex It's been changed  Thanks   Stephanie Piwetz   01/05/2001 01:41 PM 
 This was Mike Swerzbin's deal, and I guess he missed it yesterday. We just entered it and backdated it for 1/4/01. Deal # is 490867.  thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   01/05/2001 12:12 PM 
 "Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.  You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with something more original?  Kate 
 Hightlighted word? Your message is a little cryptic; so I'm not quite sure what you want me to explain. As for lunch, I just returned. It was delicious, thank you. 
 Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)  And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.  Thanks for checking up on this.  Kate 
 As you might have noticed, there was no file actually attached to your last e-mail. I was saving it for this one. 
 The graphs I've set on your desks are the product of a new version of the EOL Report. Please look them over briefly and determine whether or not the data this report pulled in is correct. I've attached a table of the data as well for another point of reference. If there are problems or discrepancies in the report, please let me know as soon as possible, and we'll adjust it accordingly.  Thanks, Kate 
 Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a lot.  Kate 
 That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run this report again.  Thanks for the suggestion, Kate 
 The STCA desk will be short 75 MW on peak at NP-15 on 1/4. This is due to two sales involving the STNW desk and one involving LTWM which have been zeroed out in scheduling but not in EnPower. All three are for 25 MW on peak.  Thanks, Kate 
 Let me know if this is what you wanted. 
 In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found two travel itineraries which came without prices on them. Jessica and Mollie have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did not detail the cost of the trip.  The prices I need are from the following trips:  Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX, Reservation # AS/WXOKNK (reservation made August 24) Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3 (reservation made September 6)  Thank you so much for your time.  Kate Symes West Origination Clerk Enron NA 503.464.3748 
 We just changed the deal - it was input correctly, but the computer did not change the time zones correctly. That's why we were off 25 MW. I'll let Duong Luu know of the problem.  Thanks, Kate 
 This was one of a slew of deals that one of our schedulers ran across that had the wrong time zone in the strips. According to Duong Luu, there was an EOL application error that was incorrectly populating deals that flow over 4/1/01 - the first of day of Daylight Savings Time. Duong said the error has since been fixed. But for the incorrect deals, we had to go in and change all the strips back to PPT and re-save the deals so the time zones would populate correctly. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion - but nothing should change other than that the MWH will be flowing on the correct hours now. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 02:59 PM 
 A heads up -  The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a 50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15. This is due to an option that Sean and Diana decided not to exercise. Thought that might clear up at least one of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....  Kate 
 Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other EnPower" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 help! 
 Question, comments, concerns.....  Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 Let me know if this works.  Kate 
 Chris entered that this morning - 562978 - would you like me to back-date it?  Kate 
 done 
 AMEREX  Diana Scholtes 563461 - should be amerex/in as prebon/changed  Chris Mallory 563362 - he changed it to Prebon  PREBON  Chris Mallory 563461 - changed to amerex 563358 - killed/new heavy load deal entered - 563967 
 Mark says it's a good deal - any reason why it didn't get checked out? 
 I sure will - and you're about right. My first free minute should be in approximately 12 years. See you then! 
 The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning.  The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, per Matt Motley who did the trades.  And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/28/2001 02:57 PM 
 Thanks for the response! I know the feeling......(is it only Wednesday?) 
 I'll change this when Risk is done calcing - but APB is right - broker fee should be .00275 on LADWP deals.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/28/2001 03:26 PM 
 563906 - changed to Pinnacle West 563907 - changed to Pinnacle West 562226 - changed to APS  Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for your help.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/29/2001 07:17 AM 
 I wanted to check with you on this. All these deals are entered in your book, and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with counterparties. However, these deals have comments in them that say they replace other deals. In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Brett -  I'm so sorry for not sending you an e-mail last night! I did test the report and it looks just fine - but I had so many things going on right up until I left that I forgot to tell YOU that it looked fine. Thanks for the reminder, and for your work on the report.  Kate 
 563262 4 units to Willamette Industries Albany Paper Mill Unit 4 units to Grays Harbor Paper Unit  563259 All units to Las Vegas Cogeneration  Please let me know if this answers your question.  Thanks, Kate 
 According to Les, we don't need to confirm any of these deals. I guess they were deals done by the Real Time desk on behalf of Services, but they were entered incorrectly. Thanks for checking, though.  Kate 
 These have been auto-scheduled, and I've told the confirms group not to confirm them. Let me know what the Nov. and Dec. deal numbers are when you get them.  Kate 
 The folowing EES sleeves have been entered and backdated to yesterday:  564924 - buy EES 564925 - sell Allegheny 564926 - buy EES 564927 - sell Allegheny 564928 - buy EES 564929 - sell Mirant  Sorry for the delay - I didn't realize Chris had been sitting on them for so long.  Thanks, Kate 
 Both deals have been changed. Jeff entered them incorrectly. 
 I'm sorry for not resonding sooner - did this get resolved? I see Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in the deal.  Kate 
 Bob's at lunch right now - I've left a big note on his desk and we'll sort it out this afternoon. Thanks for the reminder.  Kate 
 Thanks so much! I'll pass this along to the traders.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/29/2001 11:52 AM 
 Following are the deals I changed to the correct time zones, per Will Smith's list:  520330 - forward 373613 - forward 359846 - EOL 353314 - EOL 352613 - EOL 349391 - EOL 349389 - EOL 349242 - EOL 330282 - EOL 300686 - forward 272524.2 - forward 220845 - forward  Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I made sure to choose "no" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm checking with Chris Foster and Chris Mallory, who are apparently the ones initiating these trades. Both are out of the office right now, so it might be tomorrow before I can get back to you on this. But my guess is that if APX does not want to receive confirms on daily deals, then we don't need to send them. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.  Thanks, Kate 
 Done. 
 564894 - changed to Bloomberg - but it's a buy, not a sale - is this the same deal prebon is missing? 
 he just changed it to 4/2 
 fee has been added    Stephanie Piwetz   03/29/2001 03:30 PM 
 The unit on this deal is Las Vegas Cogeneration - and I asked Les to start entering the specific unit in the comments section of unit-contingent deals. Let me know if he does or does not.....  Thanks, Kate 
 Can I call you with a banana? 
 I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney, because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday. Cara asked me to e-mail you with the specifics for any scheduling adjustments that need to be made. And here they are -  563929 - KILLED  476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April  Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs. Let me know if you have any questions.  Kate 
 You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show up correctly for some reason.  Thanks, Kate 
 Please note a change in EES reported load volume on 3/31, HE 6, SP-15. The volume was incorrectly copied into the worksheet, but all EnPower deals reflect the correct number. Also, the sheets for 3/30 and 3/31 now show those respective dates at the top of the page. Please let me know if there are any questions. 
 Following are the terms under which I ran the Forward Obligation report and received this message:  General SQL error. ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis.  Terms:    Let me know what you find. Thanks!  Kate 
 These are all West Services deals, and our services traders - Les Rawson and Stan Cocke - prefer to confirm their own deals with counterparties. So these should not be confirmed. Kim Hundl and I have been working on long lists of deals that went in to be confirmed and we've since gone in and changed them. Services, Real Time, and EES trades are among those. If you'd like, you can talk to her about what we decided to confirm and not confirm, or you can give me a call at (503) 464-7486.  Thanks for checking! Kate 
 Mark - I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and price.  The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet and EnPower.  Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.  Kate 503-464-7486 
 Thanks Eric. I've changed the sheet to include your phone number. And you have a great weekend too!  Kate 
 I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 it's been changed.   Stephanie Piwetz   03/30/2001 11:07 AM 
 Hey, it worked! I have no idea what happened, but it looks great. Thanks for checking it out.  Kate 
 I knew we could find a practical use for Kristian's shoes. 
 The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you can do.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 It's been changed to 250 - Chris is going to talk to Bloomberg, though, because he thought it was a deal for 247. I'll let you know what they work out. 
 Please add to this a request for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index price. Thanks.  Kate 
 These have both been changed to Enmax Energy Corp. I'll let the Real Time traders know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Les - I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or add the unit names.  Thanks, Kate 
 Call with questions -  Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request, but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of commmand?  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the information I received from Les re: unit contingent deals. Obviously, we'll still enter the specific unit name in these deals, but this could be used as a point of reference.  Kate 
 changed to caiso energy 
 Thanks for following up, Jenny. I contacted you at Willie Harrell's suggestion, so I appreciate your quick response, and I'll contact Donnie in the future.  Kate 
 This deal should be with APB, not Prebon. Trader error. I'll change this when the calc is over - in about 45 minutes. 
 ditto on the response 
 changed to caiso 
 Bob's just finishing up a meeting, so I'll have to wait a minute for info on this EES sleeve. I'll let you know as soon as I see him.  Kate

 Here's the latest from our good buddy Ryan...... 
 DUDE! You're too good to be true. Between you and my roommates, the emanation of love germs is almost too much to handle. Hey, if you get this in the next half an hour, write back with your phone number and I'll call you when I get off work. (I'm leaving at 5 p.m. ON THE DOT today....whooo, hooo!) But this newfound life perfection sounds like it deserves a phone conversation.  Kate 
 It looks like one of our schedules got cut. I'm checking with Phil Platter on this one, and I'll let you know when I find out.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
 hi 
 it's been changed 
 This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark "no confirm" on these deals as well.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, I just got an e-mail from Evelyn saying that Prebon didn't recognize this exact deal. Mark checked it out and determined he had gone through APB. I will change this when our calc is done - in about 30 min.  Thanks, Kate 
 Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Leaf finished his shift at 6 a.m. today - he'll be back at 6 p.m. But I talked to Bill Williams about it and he saw the trade in the Real Time log, and said he remembers hearing Leaf do the trade with Sempra. If you have a number for Harry at Sempra, I'd be glad to give him a call and figure this out. Let me know.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 10:47 AM 
 I just called and left a message with Harry - I'll let you know if we're able to figure it out.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 11:35 AM 
 These are the latest figures I have - I'm so sorry for the delay! I'm calling Willie Harrell in Global Risk right now to determine why these prices are not yet in pub posting and how we can come up with a more reliable system.  Kate 
 Bill Williams just talked to Jake, the Sempra trader who did the trade, who recognized the deal and said he'd speak with Harry and clear it up. In the meantime, this is a good trade.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 10:47 AM 
 BLOOMBERG 569021 - changed to Bloomberg  PREBON Tom Alonso checked with broker - Tom Alonso did not do this deal - Jeff Richter did a similar one but it is with Williams, not Reliant......???  Jeff Richter closest deal I can see is 569178 - all same terms except it's at NP not SP  AMEREX Mike Swerzbin 569315 - added Amerex as broker 
 568843 - added fee of .0275, but Sean Crandall believes price should stay at 300.00  569178 - changed broker from APB to Prebon  569021 - changed broker from APB to Bloomberg  569270 - changed broker from APB to Amerex    Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 02:05 PM 
 broker is right - changed to Allegheny Energy Supply - formerly Merrill Lynch 
 sure thing - you looked like you could use a little late afternoon pick-me-up. 
 whaaaa? it's the end of a long day - i can't decipher these rhyming puzzles. 
 Sorry - 462105 is Transalta - my error.  And Mark's APB deal # is 461972. 
 Congratulations, Dave! 
 Mark - Attached you'll find the spreadsheet you sent me with notes I've added on each deal discrepancy. Most had already been solved, and a few pertain to Real Time spreadsheets, in which case I'll defer to Bill Williams. Please let me know if you have questions on any of my notes. If not, I believe we should be all set for March.  Thanks for your patience, Kate 
 Oops - it might help if I actually ATTACHED the attachment. 
 Les - I received the following e-mail from Confirms in Houston re: deals for which they need unit names. I sorted through the list and changed the purchases to "no confirm," and these three deals are what's left. Could you add the names in the comments section?  568866 - SELL EWEB AT BPA SYSTEM BORDER 568864 - SELL EWEB AT EWEB SYSTEM BORDER 568860 - SELL LADWP AT MCCULLOUGH  Thanks, Kate 
 Good afternoon, IT Wizards -  I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate way to run the report is showing only term deals. The "Schedule" and "Liquidate" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Kate 
 It should be COB S/N. 
 I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a problem, and we'll figure something out.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
 price changed to 420.00 
 changed to Prebon   Stephanie Piwetz   04/04/2001 02:13 PM 
 Mike has this deal in his trade log as 25 MW, but he said he'd go with the broker on this one and sell 50 MW to BPA.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you see the changes come through, Mark.  The autoscheduled deals are:  533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 535419 - 3/2/01 535420 - 3/2/01 566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 550208 - 3/15/01    The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet.   +____________ =         1016.75  Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up for March!  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 
 570011 - Prebon said it's their deal 570023 - broker was changed to Prebon 570801 - I'm waiting until after the calc to change del.point to NP 570473 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee 570444 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee 569957 - changed in CAPS but not Enpower - waiting for calc  Sorry about all those unfinished ones, but Risk started calcing a while before I got your e-mail, and they're still going. I'll let you know when these deals have been corrected.  Thanks, Kate 
 570801 - changed to NP-15 570473 - added .005 broker fee 570444 - added .005 broker fee 569957 - changed CTPY to Allegheny Energy Supply  Sorry for the delay!  Kate 
 I sent an e-mail to Les Rawson about these deals yesterday, but - oops! - he's not in the office. I just had Stan Cocke enter the unit names in them, so you should see the following in the comments section -  568866 - unit name is Willamett Industries Albany Paper Mill 568864 - unit name is Grays Harbor Paper Mill 568860 - unit name is Las Vegas Cogeneration Facility  Thanks, Kate 
 Just a reminder -  We have added a new pub code to EnPower. The code is for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index. Please advise that the Portland West Desk has one deal in the system at this time against that index, and more may follow.  Thanks for your help with entering these prices.  Kate 
 I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than that, on your end.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what you need from us.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks so much, Willie! 
 This deal has been autoscheduled and should show up with correct on peak volumes on the new CARP report.  Kate 
 You are such a renewable energy stud! I'm excited to see you and Elliot transform the way the world thinks of POWER.  K 
 Thanks a lot, Kerri. 
 I'm just sending the sheets that are saved in our system. Bill Williams told me he cleared everything up on the Real Time side yesterday, but if the volumes in these documents still look wrong, please let me know.    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 deal is in at 260. 
 PREBON 571801 was a duplicate of another sale to EES - Mike killed the duplicate (#571920) and kept this deal  AMEREX 572245 - changed to BOM (4/9 - 4/30) 
 Thanks for the clarification (Mike was a little off!) - we've killed 571801 and restored 571920.  Kate 
 Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May? 
 Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He just might get a sweet deal out of it!  Kate 
 This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals.  I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Evelyn - Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything should look good now - 571920 now has 25 mwh and 571801 is killed. Let me know if you still see something wrong.  Thanks, Kate 
 This deal discrepancy seems to have a few of us stumped - so I'm referring it to all of you in hopes that we can solve this today. Following are the terms of the deal:  Short Term California buys Enron Energy Services Hours: HE 6-9 Delivery Point: SP-15 Term: 3/29/01 Price: $110  The deal was entered by Bert Meyers, a Real Time trader, on behalf of STCA. It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of $130, not a buy at a price of $160.  My first instinct was to simply modify the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the price coming across as $130. I'm reluctant to send any more incorrect information to EES, as we've already dealt with enough confusion over this matter. Please take a look at the deal and its corresponding documents, and let me know which is the correct price.  Thanks for your help, Kate 
 It should have been Sierra Power Corp. I've changed it.  Thanks, kate 
 I was told that I will need an employee number in order to enter the hours I've worked this week. Is this something I should have already? Please let me know whenever you get a free moment. 
 I changed this deal, by the way. Please let me know if the broker thinks he's wrong. 
 Mike checking with his broker right now. 
 one was in with prebon - 572999 - it's been changed to apb 
 Mark just told me this trade was done direct - I've deleted the broker out of deal 573083.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks! Kate Symes Enron North America Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80.  Thanks, Kate 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy. 
 Here you go! 
 Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through lately. I'm checking with IT on this.  Thanks, Kate  PS - I'll add you to the Deal Correction Report mail list starting today. 
 I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)  Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name Chris Foster has requested:  Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries Address: PO Box 496028 Redding, CA 96049 Or: 19759 Riverside Ave. Anderson, CA 96007 Phone: (530) 378-8179 Fax: (530) 378-8139 Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery  I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner we can change that the better.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks for taking the initiative to get everyone together in the spirit of spending Andy and/or Gray's money. Things like this need to happen more often, in my opinion.  That's a picture of you in high school, right? 
 fee has been added 
 Joanie! I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to the Enron devil. In fact, I have no time to be writing this e-mail right now, but I've been meaning to drop a line and catch up with you. I also just ran into Brigdet (from the class below us at SMA) at lunch - apparently she's married to some baseball player. Crazy! So right away I had to contact my ever-realistic "single" friend to bring me some sanity. I'm actually dating a guy right now, but it still gives me the chills to hear about anyone near my age walking down the toilet...I mean aisle. Anyway, call me, or I'll call you tonight - let's dish! I hope everything's great with you - I expect nothing less. I have lots of interesting stories to tell about how and why I've come to the decision that I'm sending my roommates to rehab.  Love, Kate 503-464-7486 (work) 503-288-6546 (home) 503-819-2181 (cell) 
 PREBON Both Phil's deals have been changed to buys already, and Mike is entering the AEP sale right now.  Thanks, kate 
 I get a "no records selected" message when I try to pull up 576220. ???? 
 Sean has COB in his trade log. He originally had Mid-C, then crossed it out. Sounds like Amerex just hasn't updated their website with the change. 
 Sorry - I misread the e-mail. Checked with Jeff Richter - they should be sales, and they're changed in Enpower now.  Thanks, Kate 
 deal is in as off peak - did someone already fix it? 
 Thank you! 
 How in the hell do you get out of work at 3:45? Well, you've inspired me - I'm going to haul ass home and maybe make it there by 6 pm - whoo-hoooooo! But seriously, call me tonight if you get a chance. If not, I'll try you (if I can dig up your home number somewhere) or call when you get into town this weekend. I'll be around, so we HAVE to hang out at least once. 'Kay? Or I'll just stalk you. 'Kay? Take care.  Love, Kate 
 I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of Oakland. Also, the contact is still Wing Lau @ 510-627-1457. I'll change it when Risk is done with the calc.  Thanks, Kate 
 Please let me know if this format is accessible and useful for you. I know some of these deal changes aren't relevant to your calculation discrepancies, but I included everything just in case. If you'd like it pared down or beefed up, don't hesitate to ask. Thanks for your patience. 
 I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour-ahead market.  Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
 Deal has been changed to The City of Oakland, a municipal corp., and contact info has been added.  Kate 
 I've modified these deals to read as follows:  572069 West Services buys from APX NP-15 On Peak - 12 MW @ $245 for flow 4/6-4/7 Off Peak - 12 MW @ $150 for flow 4/7 TOTAL MWH = 480  576468 West Services buys from APX NP-15 Off Peak - 12 MW @ $140 for flow 4/6 TOTAL MWH = 96  Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension (503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823.  Thanks, Kate 
 The following deal has been changed once more. Here are the details:  576468 West Services buys from APX NP-15 Off Peak - 1.8 MW @ $140 10.2 MW @ $150 TOTAL MWH = 96  (572069 stays 12 MW @ $150)  Please call me with questions.  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 or 3823 
 Yes, that's correct, Mark says.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/10/2001 10:55 AM 
 All these have been changed to CAISO firm energy, and deal 576511 has been changed to Reliant Energy Services. Thanks for catching these. I'm forwarding this e-mail on to the Real Time group (again) as a reminder.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey - Are you guys boycotting CAISO energy?  Kate 
 Broker is right - I've changed the deals to Allegheny Energy Supply Co.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm taking over Carla Hoffman's position at the Deal Control desk in Portland, and I've got a request from Kim Ward to look into this deal entered incorrectly by our Short Term Southwest desk. Unfortunately, I need more information, such as the deal number and term, in order to make any changes to it.  If you have this or know who does, please let me know and I'll be happy to make any necessary changes to this deal. My number in Portland is 503.464.7486.  Thanks, Kate 
 These have been changed to CAISO. 
 All these deals have been changed to FPL Energy Marketing.   Stephanie Piwetz   04/10/2001 02:27 PM 
 577133 - I just added APB for the broker. 
 Mike is taking care of these changes right now. 
 577824 sell sempra np Q2-02 $80  This is the other side of the EES sleeve - Prebon gave Mike these prices, and he couldn't get ahold of them tonight, so we'll check in the morning.  Kate 
 This is the price Prebon quoted to Mike tonight - he'll be checking in the morning to see what the spread should have been.  Thanks, Kate 
 BLOOMBERG 577573 - changed to Aquila 577533 - added .005 broker fee  AMEREX 577873 - LTNW sells EES/Cal'07-Cal'10/Off Peak/$44.50  PREBON 577849 - Jeff Richter buys BP (changed broker to Prebon)  AMEREX I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.  Thanks, Kate 
 Chris - Looks like these deals might have been entered for the wrong term. I'll check with Jeff on this, but if you recognize that the terms are wrong, please let me know and I can fix them. Here are the deals:  576274 STCA buys ARCO SP-15 May-01 On Peak 15 MW @ $260  576275 STCA buys ARCO SP-15 May-01 Off Peak 15 MW @ $135  Thanks for checking on this. Kate 
 Mike is checking with his broker right now. 
 Mike is checking with broker. 
 I'm sorry - this was the first correction I received this morning and since it didn't come in the form of an e-mail, I unfortunately overlooked it when I was finalizing the deal error report. 
 Diana says Amerex told her both deals were on the same ticket - so she entered deal 577201at 50 mw. I asked her to get ahold of her contact at Amerex to tell them they're checking out incorrectly.  Thanks, Kate 
 I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me to make a note of this in the comments sections of the deals?  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/11/2001 07:55 AM 
 Mike talked to Prebon and changed the prices for these deals accordingly  577823 - $97.95 577824 - $98  Thanks for waiting, Kate 
 I sent this along to Molly, because, while I hate to admit it, I think she might be better suited to such a daunting task.  K 
 Chris - Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name (Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co.  Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal.  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 
 Thanks for following up on this, Melissa. I've forwarded your e-mail on to Chris Foster and asked him to discuss the counterparty name with Bob Ellery, his contact at Sierra Pacific Holding Co. I'll let you know which name we need (or if we need one at all) as soon as I hear back from him.  Thanks again, Kate 503-464-7486 
 Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 It was great to run into you, too. This shrinking world never ceases to amaze me......to end up working in the same building, different industry, over a year later? Crazy. So, on lunch or a beer after work, just let me know the time and place. Lunch is a rarity with me, but I love to have an excuse to breathe fresh air in the middle of the day. And I need to plan ahead as well. I'll keep the week of the 22nd open - sound good?  Talk to you soon. Kate 
 Anytime! Thanks for all your patience!  Kate 
 This has been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike is entering these trades right now.  Kate 
 Motley just entered these last three trades. And Chris Mallory is entering the AEP deal right now. 
 Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -  Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list in EnPower.  Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance in getting this deal out of the "New Counterparty" void.  Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Yes, the correct name does include "Inc." at the end. And yes, Steve Hall said the master agreement works for this trade. He and Bob Ellery at Sierra talked over the agreement and decided to use the name that Sierra Pacific Holding Co. is doing business under. I've changed the deal (573679) in EnPower. Please let me know if you turn up any more questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes - I've been working with Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty and Melissa Murphy. The new name has been entered into the system, and deal # 573679 has been changed from New Counterparty to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. (That's the name Sierra Pacific Holding Co. is doing business as.) Thanks for checking in on this, though.  Kate 
 I sent a copy of the agreement to Melissa Murphy via fax. I'll need to get ahold of Chris Foster, who is in your Houston office at the moment, to locate the original. He won't be back in the Portland office until Monday morning. When would you like the original by? Just let me know - we'll get it to you as soon as we can.  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 
 Okay - I can forward the contract along on Monday when Chris Foster gets back. Also, I think I'd like Chris and his contact at Sierra to talk over the issue of whether we'll amend the contract to include "Inc." or whether we'll amend the counterparty name in EnPower. I've left a message for Chris regarding this question, and hopefully we'll touch base sometime today. I will let you know as soon as I hear back. (And feel free to nab him for a moment if you see him in the office!)  Thanks, Kate 
 P.S. I'll ask Bill Williams about Geir's transmission deal. Can I ask, though, why it looks like it should be a buy-resale?  Kate 
 Okay - I've changed 578812 to Sierra Pacific Power Co. I asked Bill about this and he said he didn't realize the counterparty was in with Sierra Pacific Industries and not Sierra Pacific Power. The Real Time guys pay as little attention as possible to counterparty names, unfortunately.  Thanks for catching this, Kate 
 Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba on our master agreement is "Sierra Pacific Industries" with no "Inc." at the end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, although the company is a corporation, they never use "Inc." in their contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master agreement because of those three pesky letters.  Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April.  Thanks again for all your help. Kate 503-464-7486 
 Mom - Thanks for the heads up. I am having the same nightmare with US Bank that I've had each time I've deposited any money: they won't let me have it! I've been meaning to e-mail Anna and let her know, but that's gone by the wayside along with pretty much everything else since I started this new job. I tried to close my account on Thursday in a last ditch effort to get at my money, and they politely told me I could close it on the same day I could get money out of the ATM, which will be on Wednesday. Until then my hands are tied. I'm really sorry about this - I know Anna needs help, and believe me, this isn't very convenient for me either. I'll e-mail her right now, and send her money on Wednesday.  Give me a call later if you'd like to meet at the gym.  Kate 
 I've changed this to BP Energy - and I was wondering - didn't BP Amoco change over to BP Energy? Do we ever trade with the old counterparty name anymore?  Kate 
 Thanks for checking on that, Rhonda - I'll make a mental note of it.  Kate 
 Bob Badeer just entered the Cal-02 deal under Long Term California desk. Deal # is 580382.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/12/2001 12:29 PM 
 580280 - Jeff had this in with Bloomberg. I changed it to Natsource.  Kate 
 It's El Paso Electric - I've changed it.  Thanks, Kate 
 BLOOMBERG 580280 - changed to APB  580168 - added broker fee  580159 - added broker fee  580169 - STCA buys El Paso through Bloomberg (Chris had it in with Calpine)  Thanks, Kate 
 You're right - I think our e-mails just crossed paths. 
 I'm just going to leave this deal with "New Counterparty" for the time being. I had changed it to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc., but it sounds like there may be a problem with this name. Please let me know what I can do to help this along, or give me a call when a decision is reached.  Thanks, Kate 
 It's changed.   Stephanie Piwetz   04/13/2001 08:10 AM 
 Mark is changing this right now.   Stephanie Piwetz   04/13/2001 09:01 AM 
 Well, I only went to the gym once last week, and then pretty much ate and slept all weekend, so I'm feeling like a pasty white blob of winter blubber. I'm just starting to get "homesick" for Maui, so Mexico will come not a minute too soon. Also, Molly and I went to see this movie last night, Requiem for a Dream. It was psychotic! It made me feel like moving to a farm and becoming a marathon-running vegan or something. Truly a horrible, horrible depiction of modern-day addictions and the messed-up way our society quells them.  So, needless to say, I am MAKING myself go to the gym today.  Anna's job opportunity sounds great, although I'm bummed we won't be roomies anytime soon. Maybe I'll get transferred to Enron's Colorado office.  Kate 
 Yes - it's with APB - I've changed it. 
 Done. 
 I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name "Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc." in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on 4/10.)  I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, I changed the deal from it's "new counterparty" status.  Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed to thoroughly confuse them. I'm researching most of these questions, but as with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the spreadsheet you guys send to them. Would you mind checking this out when you have a minute (or despite the fact that you don't)? If you revise anything, just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch.  Thanks, Kate 
 Bill, Jr. - I'm so sorry! I should know better by now. Bill, III - You might be more interested in this e-mail than your dad.  Kate 
 These are done.  Have a good weekend! Kate 
 Go Blazers! 
 This is a Real Time deal, and that desk enters deals a bit differently than I do. When they initially do a deal, they enter it for a certain hour or set of hours. Then, if they agree with a counterparty to extend the deal to flow through more hours, they change the deal in Scheduling, not EnPower. The way to see the true volume of a Short Term West Hourly deal is to look in the "View Actuals" tab. If you look at this deal, you'll see that they extended the initial 5 MW at HE 11 to look like this:  HE 11 - 5 MW HE 12 - 5 MW HE 13 - 5 MW HE 14 - 4 MW HE 15 - 4 MW HE 16 - 4 MW HE 17 - 5 MW +__________ 32 MW  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 BLOOMBERG Are you talking about the broker fee?  TRADESPARK Matt's contact is verifying this trade as off-peak.  AMEREX Chris just changed deal 582853 from APB to Amerex  582894 - changed to 47.75  PREBON Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with Prebon? 
 I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused!  And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.  Thanks, Kate 
 That sounds like a good one, mom. Like I've said before, I think it's a great idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on rental cars. If you start shopping around for a cheap ticket now, you could take a scouting trip this spring and make plans to move by the following winter - just in time for whale-watching.  Just do it! 
 Here you go, Jill - let me know what you think.  Kate 503-288-6546 or 503-819-2181 
 Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, sorry for the delay.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just spoke with Sean and he said he was indifferent on the subject - so you guys can go ahead and confirm these deals. I'm looking into why Puget sales seem to be coming up "no confirm." Thanks for checking, though.  Kate 
 I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now a
