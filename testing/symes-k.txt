 Have you received any of these - I had notified Holli of four total missing confirm letters.  Kate 
 Done. 
 Thanks for checking. I entered this deal today and am still getting used to all the different variations of company names. You're right - it's El Paso Merchant.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike said to just enter a new deal with these terms - deal is 539032, and I've backdated the trade date to 3/1. He's going to double-check the EES spreadsheet to make sure he didn't miss something. In the meantime, the deal is in there now.  Thanks, Kate 
 What's the correct delivery point on this deal - sell PGE, mar-01 through dec-01, on peak, 50 mw, DJ Mid-C index (trade date 2/12)?  Kate

 Update - 
 Thanks for the explanation, Diana!  Kate 
 Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. Please call me with questions.  This spreadsheet includes a missing purchase for total of 55 mw @ 195.00 on 2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.   This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 on 2/6.    In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.  Thanks, Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 Voila! Have fun.... 
 Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to them.  Kate

 Prebon is sending a new confirmation with Constellation as the counterparty. Broker mistake.   Stephanie Piwetz   11/16/2000 01:00 PM 
 Mike just got back to me on this - these are good deals that he forgot to write down. I'm entering them right now, and I'll let you know the deal numbers in a second.  Kate 
 539859 - buy PGET 539861 - sell EES 
 It's been changed - sorry. 
 I will be attending an Energy Math training session today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST. Please direct all correspondence to traders whose deals are in question. I'm sorry for the inconvenience - but hopefully I'll be smarter when I come back!  I'll check in and wrap things up at 5:00, so if you have any questions you'd like to save for me, I'll be at my desk then.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm having Diana look into it - I'll let you know.  Kate 
 She changed it to price 360.00  Thanks, Kate 
 I know - it's amazing that in this age of technological wizardry we are forced to resort to some of the cheesiest hijinks known to man. Of course, if I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner.  Love, Kate 
 They've been added - thanks for reminding me.  Kate 
 I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however you'd like. We'll talk.  Kate 
 Yes - I've added it. 
 Have fun with these! 
 Okay, I don't know where Jeff's head was today, but he just checked with Prebon and found he had done this deal without even knowing it! So he entered it - Deal #461171.  Thanks a lot for your patience, Stephanie.   Stephanie Piwetz   11/16/2000 02:32 PM 
 Following are the deals we've changed -  536574 - from Firm to Caiso energy 537885/886/888/889/890 - from Yes to No confirm  And I'm looking into the status of the price on 538874. I'll let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike still has about 6 deals to put in, and those are two of them. It should just be a minute.  I'm killing a deal right now so my deal entry is tied up - who's the trader on 541368? 
 I'm killing deal 539968 at Sharon Cason's request - it was previously killed and she needed me to reinstate it so she could sort out the confirm. Then I had to re-kill it. 
 broker is right - this is changed to DYPMI 
 broker is right - changed to Coral 
 541226 - changed to APB 
 Amerex Sean just entered this deal - he says it's with Transalta, not TranCanada. Mark's deal should have been APB - it's changed.  Prebon Mike missed this deal - I just entered it - 541616 
 Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Fran - It looks like you either made changes or added legs to this deal today. Do they need to reconfirm this? Please let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm killing it now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Tom Alonso's deal has been entered - Deal #461177 
 Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.  Kate 
 It looks like only leg 4 had firm energy - I changed that to CAISO. Legs 2 and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?  Kate 
 okay - cool. 
 Questions about this deal -  1. Should energy type be CAISO? 2. Should trade date be 3/7? 3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?  I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the confirmation status.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm losing my mind. Did I already forward this note to you? Do you still need the confirmation information? I can print out whatever they have stored in Livelink, or you can contact Stephanie - it looks like she has what you were searching for.  Thanks, Kate 
 are they sweets of any kind? 
 you're kidding! that's ludicrous! what exactly is there? 
 I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 ludicrous = amusing or laughable through obvious absurdity, incongruity, exaggeration, or eccentricity  what is lexic?  and, oh my god, is it andy's birthday today? 
 To re-cap: I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.  Kate 
 Re: missing APB deal  tom a buying koch 20-30 25 mw 114.00 palo on peak  Tom Alonso just returned my call and verified that he had entered the deal. Jeff Richter had entered it, thinking it wasn't in the system, so I'm now killing his deal. The correct deal number is 461133.  Thanks a lot. 
 Mark's missing deal - 542424 - in at 50 mw. Mark said Pinnacle and he both know the deal as 50 mw - Prebon mistake.  K 
 what was the trade date on this? 
 this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or not it's a good trade.  thanks, Kate 
 This deal is in under Short Term California, not Long Term Northwest, and the trader is Phil Platter, not Mike Swerzbin, and there is no broker. Are you sure this is the deal in question?  Kate 
 Mike negotiated no broker fee on this - he just spoke to his broker and asked to have them stop asking for that.  Thanks, Kate  P.S. I know the feeling about needing a vacation - sooner rather than later! Hang in there! 
 This should be Amerex - Diana is changing it now. 
 in with wrong broker - changed 547680 and 547681 to APB 
 Prebon Mark Fischer Changed 547680/681 to APB  Chris Mallory 547716  Amerex Mark Fischer Killed 547637  Diana Scholtes Says 547287 is definitely only 25 mw 
 We think the broker's right - can't read Mark's handwriting - but I can't change the price until they're done with the calc - about 20 min. I'll let you know.  Kate 
 price has been changed to 207.50. 
 Bloomberg shows correctly. Computer defaulted to all days in Deal Blotter. I'll change this as soon as Risk is done calcing - about 1 hour.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/16/2000 03:18 PM 
 I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, I know it's not.  So how are things "down" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of '01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those perfunctory "news" stories begging the question, "Just how much will I ever care?" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the "urgency of the building's reconstruction" due to its "inability to be inhabited until 2003." Is it just me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?  Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.  I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling pieces of crumbling buildings.  Kate 
 Did you already settle this with Les? It looks like the deal is only flowing M-S, on peak hours. Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Bob - Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through Cal'09.  I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions regarding that time frame.  Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.  Kate 
 Mary Hain said she would get the paperwork going on this master agreement. Either Mary or I will be in touch to let you know when this is in place.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've been keeping track of this with Tracy Ngo, our credit gal, and the last thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a deal is "pending credit approval" it's a little vague as to when the decision will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top of it and let you know this afternoon.  Thanks, Kate 
 Done.  K 
 Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Prebon Sean Crandall 549048 - changed to NP  Diana Scholtes Prebon broker said our price (215) and del. point (Cob) are right  Jeff Richter 549013 - changed to APB  549010 - enron buys BP/Apr01/NP/peak/207.00 (in with Amerex - should it be Prebon?)  Chris Mallory - just entered Williams deal 
 chris - just finished entering deals  jeff - 549013 - changed to APB from Prebon  548756 - changed to 82.52 
 Just confirmed with Mike. Broker is correct - 25 MW. I'll change this deal when Risk is done with their calculation.  Thanks, Kate 
 Natsource is going to have to give you a trader name on this because I've asked all of them and nobody recognizes it.  Kate 
 This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought they were the same....???  Kate 
 Sorry - Sean just changed this deal from Mid-C to NP-15. I've changed the energy to CAISO.  Thanks, Kate 
 Then I guess we can safely say that Jeff is in la-la land.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thank you! I was so baffled for a minute there - when I said "April option" every trader just looked at me like I was crazy!  Kate 
 It's been changed to Prebon.  Kate 
 549052 - del. point is already in as Mid-C, so just the price is wrong? 
 Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.  Thanks, Kate 
 Okay, that makes more sense. I've left a big note on Sean's desk and I'm watching the door of the meeting for him to come out.  Kate 
 We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if Prebon still disputes.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed. 
 Note to Real Time desk: EES sent over revised volumes for delivery at SP-15 after I sent the spreadsheet out today. Please disregard the variance volumes for that delivery point. Instead, make a note of the new volumes, shown in red under the heading "EPMI Length" directly to the right of the "Var" column.

 Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!  I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain "lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania" anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!  Love, Kate 
 Okay - let me know if you need anything later.  Kate 
 Yep - the strips are changed to reflect term 3/15 to 3/31. Glad that's finally solved!  Thanks, Kate 
 Sean Crandall changed the term of it during last night's checkout with Prebon, but forgot to change the strip in the deal. It's fixed now to reflect a term of 3/15 to 3/31.  Thanks, Kate 
 Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't run into anymore deals that won't save due to blank deal entry fields. If you do, though, please let Dave or me know and we'll look into it further. You should now be able to add to the deal clearing tab and save the deal.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Transmission deals go through Arizona Public Service, not APS Energy Services. This deal has been changed. Let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 It should be Arizona Public Service. I guess the CTPY name just changed, so Ryan was a bit confused. I talked with Bill Williams about it and forwarded the message on to both of them. Deal has been corrected.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually good-looking farm workers.Tres important!  So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it.  The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....  I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back soon.  Kate

 How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre, like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on.  And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything pisses her off. Gotta love it.  So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point. I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have my happy little family.....  Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose, which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?  Love ya, Kate 
 I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you think of it later, you might ask.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/14/2001 03:36 PM 
 This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can save your part.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a problem. And you're right - that's not bad at all!  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed both strips to reflect 3/16-3/31.  Thanks, Kate 
 I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or is there another deal number?  Thanks, Kate 
 okay, this deal has been changed to CAISO.  Thanks, Kate 
 This has been changed. 
 Another trivial counterparty name change - it's Enmax Energy Corp., not just plain old Enmax Corp. These deals have been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals have been changed to reflect the correct counterparty name, and I've forwarded the message to the real time traders who did the deals and their manager. Thanks for the heads up!  Kate 
 Sorry Rhonda - I forgot to also send this message on to you!  Kate 
 550042/550048 - changed to yes confirm - entered by Real Time guy who isn't in the habit of day-ahead trade settings  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed both of these deals to be confirmed, since we're confirming all daily trades now. Just wanted to let you know.  Kate 
 whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs (it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word "owner" underneath. do you think that means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them "employee owners"? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you.  kate 
 You shouldn't be sorry about the fact that you need help.  K    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 yeah - mike is entering all his deals now. 
 changed to pinnacle west - and you might mention to apb, if you feel like it, that it would save their time during checkout if they told tom the correct counterparty when the trade was done - he said apb never seems to know whether it's APS or pinnacle, but for his part he doesn't mind which counterparty it's with - anyway, just fyi...  thanks, Kate 
 I'll have Dave Poston fix it and get back to you.  Kate 
 I think number 5 especially applies to you boys. 
 Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you posted if anything else comes up.  Thanks, Kate 
 551260 - changed to 227  And I'm entering Jeff's deals right now - he went into a meeting and neglected to finish deal entry!  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 551764    Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:51 PM 
 You should see all of these deals in the system - he just entered them. Let me know if something doesn't show up, or if you need deal numbers.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 changed to no confirm - 542401/542393/542396  kate 
 p.s. 551260 has been changed to 227.00 - what a mistake that would have been!   Stephanie Piwetz   03/15/2001 02:26 PM 
 Please note volume changes in SP-15 fixed price sale, 3/17, HE 15 and 16. 
 Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner" of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you didn't notice that.  Kate 
 this has been changed to firm - thanks for catching it.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 07:43 AM 
 The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.  Thank you, Kate 
 The deals were entered yesterday -  461029 Williams  461030 EES  Thanks 
 I've changed all three deals to firm energy.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 10:33 AM 
 Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:  Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi  Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me know if you need more information.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Here's the procedure for adding new traders to the system. I've requested to have Paul Choi's name added - Greg Wolfe and the rest of the mid-marketers appear to already be in there.  Kate 
 Mike's still entering his deals - they should be showing up momentarily. 
 552673 - changed to sell  Missing trades should be in now. Let me know if they're not.   Stephanie Piwetz   03/16/2001 12:32 PM 
 Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will potentially do deals with all of the traders -  Long Term Southwest Long Term Northwest Long Term California Long Term West Management  Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.  Kate    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 yes, he's still inputting. 
 Just constantly adding value, aren't we..... 
 It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile - if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your help.  Kate    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I'd love to receive all three publications by e-mail.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the latest version. Sound better? 
 I just talked with Mike, and he thinks this trade was made on the 14th, but possibly entered on the 15th and back-dated. He's coming in to the office in a few minutes and will call the broker to be sure. I'll let you know as soon as they've worked it out.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   11/17/2000 08:31 AM 
 I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.  Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first. So for the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great Gatsby in my possession.  Kate 
 I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Dave, Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just holler over here whenever you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate 
 553809 - changed to APB 553810 - changed to APB  554166 - changed to BP Energy Co.  Jeff is entering the rest of his deals right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/19/2001 02:26 PM 
 Jeff is still entering deals. 
 Thanks - I guess the computer defaults were set wrong and a few deals were entered with incorrect BOM dates. They've been corrected.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/19/2001 03:21 PM 
 Here are the deals we changed to the correct balance-of-the-month term (3/21/01 to 3/31/01):  554245 554253 554252 554257  Thanks, Kate 
 You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete in that category. Especially not at the end of a long day. Of staring. At this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour to decide.....  K 
 Our fax number is 503-464-3740. You can send those deal numbers over whenever you get a chance, and I'll look them over and talk to the appropriate traders and IT. Thanks so much for your diligence during this transition. I'll keep you informed on the IT effort.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've changed deal 547478 to reflect the correct price - $109.90 off peak and $174.15 on peak - and made a note in our deal correction report. Please keep me informed on any discrepancies you run across. I'll be happy to look into it.  Thanks, Kate 
 Mike has 25 MW with no broker fee in his trade log. I just spoke with him and he's going to call Natsource to confirm this. But this deal should be correct as it is in the system.  Thanks, Kate 
 550480 has been changed to Merrill per Sean Crandall  550383 and 550385 - I'm still waiting to hear from Mike Driscoll on these - I'll let you know.  Thanks, Kate 
 those dummies! (it's changed back)  Thanks, Kate 
 550383 and 550385 have been changed to Nevada Power per Mike Driscoll.  Kate 
 I've spoken with Rhonda about this, and I'll be letting the traders know to be prepared for the change. This deal has been changed to Allegheny.  Thanks, Kate 
 Tom's in a meeting, but in his trade log he has APS crossed out and over it he's written Pinnacle. So I'm going to wait to find out what happened. I'll let you know.  Kate 
 Traders are finishing up a meeting and Mike has his trade log with him. I'll let you know in a second. 
 mike says 555403 is Q3-02 - it's been changed but  he thinks 555404 should be Jul-02, not Q3-02 - is Natsource broker sure? 
 555410 has been changed to Q4-02, and Mike's still entering deals. 
 it's changed. 
 555159 has been changed to APS. 
 These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. (This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!  Thanks, Kate 
 sorry - we changed the year and just changed each strip - but since it was originally entered in deal blotter it had those extra strips and, long story short, it should be right now.  thanks Kate 
 i'm having deal blotter and deal entry problems - please bear with me while i try to change this, but it might be a minute.  Thanks, Kate 
 he's wrong - mike just checked with his broker, who should correct it. 
 chris says both of these prices are correct - is broker still disputing them? 
 I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right term and volume now.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.  Thanks, Kate 
 Will -  I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.  Kate 
 Cheers?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what you're doing say, "I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A BISCUIT." And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of advice for the day)  Kate 
 Don't get defensive. I was just worried you had picked up another silly affectation.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks a lot, Kim! 
 yes....yes it does.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Good morning -  Just wanted to let you know that I've been running the stage version of the Forward Obligation report using production data, and I seem to be getting all the same numbers as I do with the production version of the report. I will continue to compare the two today when I run these reports, just to make sure. But in the meantime, all looks well. Thanks for your help.  Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I left a note for Jeff last night, and apparently he already changed the deals to reflect APB's price 554905 is $350 554912 is $325  Kate 
 The following deals have been autoscheduled for 2/1/01  556553 556561  Let me know if this comes through on your report.  Thanks, Kate 
 it's been changed to M-S 
 556890 - changed to M-S (jeremy's mask was wrong) 556515 - mike swerzbin says this is definitely a peak deal - let me know what amerex says  Kate 
 couldn't "doll" be classified as harassment in the workplace...... 
 you think people are really fooled by your innocent facade? 
 Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.  The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.  The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III and me.  I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal numbers.  461029 Williams 115.00  461030 EES 114.95  461801 Mieco 115.00  461802 EES 114.95  And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. Confusion!  Hope this fixes it. 
 Melissa - I just wanted to let you know that I can definitely get this list to you today. I'm a little buried right now dealing with some IT issues we're having with the new Full Service Power application, Forward Obligation report, etc., etc., so it may take me a little while. Is it okay if I get this to you by 1 p.m. PST? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write back....if you can still move your fingers.  Sincerely, Kate (the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look constantly busy) 
 It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?  Thanks, kate 
 And thanks for your hard work, too! I've been checking the new version agains production data today and it looks good to me as well. I'm sorry I haven't been more actively involved - I've been drowning in a new version of the EOL report and this new FSP application. So thanks for being in correspondence with the guys in Houston.  Kate 
 No - they pay you just for being you! 
 558066 - I see 367 in this deal  557412 - Mallory's deal changed to Bloomberg  Sean is entering last two deals. 
 changed to Bloomberg 
 I'm so sorry - 557552 (I was looking at that deal and trying to write at the same time - oops!) 
 This deal is in - 558076 - but it's with Matt Motley's book. 
 558176 - he just entered it 
 Thanks for checking. I changed this deal to reflect off-peak hours only.  Also, Tom Alonso just let me know that deal #460678 actually has a Mid-C delivery point, not Palo Verde. I changed this as well, but wanted to let you know so you can re-confirm.  Thanks, Kate 
 Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.  Kate 
 I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can do to assist.  West Power Traders Tim Belden Matt Motley Mike Swerzbin Mike Driscoll Bob Badeer Sean Crandall Diana Scholtes Tom Alonso Mark Fischer Jeff Richter Chris Mallory Jeremy Morris Phil Platter  Again, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online. Our other groups - mid-marketing, origination, and fundamentals - do not trade online. I believe that development in San Francisco also does not trade online.  Thanks, Kate 
 After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Happy reading! 
 These have been approved and auto-scheduled.  Kate 
 Details in exchange for this -  I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges since last spring: "We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'" The lead of the story was this: "The California Independent System Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since last May."  First of all, tell me what the difference is between "overcharges" and "excessive" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically unattractive.  Then you get details.  Kate 
 I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word "stunning" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in his/her story.  But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.  There was no date.  Kate 
 Wow - what a nice Friday morning surprise to hear from my old friend Bobby. We must go back, what, at least half a year? Hey, it's no fun around our house with you being a stranger and all. We're having people over for a barbeque tonight - come by! Call me at work - 464-7486 - or catch someone at home later - 288-6546. We have to celebrate the beginning of spring, and you're not exempt. Have a super day at work. Talk to you later?  Kate 
 Hey! I'm so brain dead this morning I didn't even notice. But I'm sooooo glad you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel like a proud mother. Thanks for letting me know.  Kate 
 550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from EPMI to EES (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less than weighted average, making it $177.27)  552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices reflected in my worksheet Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals they've done on EES's behalf.  Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss it person to person.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 You rock, Angela! Don't worry, I'll be my usual quiet and unassuming self when I come by for lunch. Although, if you guys are having hotdogs, doesn't that mean that everyone pre-ordered? That would leave me "sans hotdog," which would be tragic. Let me know.  Kate 
 That's hilarious! My theme song for life is "Don't go breaking my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee, which incidentally has always been one of my favorites. I remember first hearing it on a Disney special where Elton did a duet with Minnie Mouse. What a kick! Thanks.  Kate 
 Hey Anna - you're a kook! I just got this from mom like two seconds ago! But thanks..... 
 BLOOMBERG Matt Motley 559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358  Tom Alonso 559010 - price is changed to $160 He is still entering last two deals.  AMEREX Mike Swerzbin 559062 - buys AEP, 25 mw, Cal-02, PV, $140 And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were correct.   Thanks, kate 
 I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there were two deals. ????  Kate 
 That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. Mike's exact words were, "there's no way it's $258." So if anyone from Prebon is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.  Thanks, Kate 
 503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.  Kate 
 Find out what your theme song is - it only takes a second. And keep in mind it could be something extremely fitting like Todd's - "My Boyfriend's Back." 
 just added - 559276 
 I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.  534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 mw per hour  559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak hours 559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak hours  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.  Thanks for your patience, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Thanks, chica. 
 Original...original...original. 
 The last two LTNW deals - 349864 and 318870 are changed to correct time zones. They gave me the option to choose "no" for rerouting of schedules. They were both EOL deals.  Kate 
 Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....  I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with "us." I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have to go. I'll call you tonight!  Take care, kate 
 It's been changed. Thanks!  Kate 
 Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, kate 
 I just got your fax - thank you! I'll start changing over those deals right now, so it shouldn't be long. I'll send you another e-mail when they're all done.  Kate 
 I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been fixed. Thanks for clarifying this.  Kate 
 The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have to get in the habit of doing it.  Thanks again, Kate 
 Mike confirmed with Amerex that this deal was done on the 14th. They're going to change it.   Stephanie Piwetz   11/17/2000 08:31 AM 
 I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part of the time zone glitch?  Kate 
 I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me know if that sounds good.  Kate 
 Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:  1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask Jeff?  2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"  3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?  4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed deals as well?  Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. Thanks for your help!  Kate 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy - we have two new Real Time guys training at the same time. Scary!  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be specified as CAISO firm.  Thanks, Kate 
 517814 - added .0075 fee per Chris Mallory  535228 - I'm waiting for Tom's desk to settle down a bit - they're in the middle of trading.  Any idea why APB's just checking these deals out now? They're from the beginning of February. Just wondering.  Thanks, Kate 
 Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her number is 703-853-3001.  I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said.  I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.  Kate 
 535228 - broker fee added per Tom Alonso 
 I've left a message for Jeff, but I can't seem to find him or his trade log anywhere. Until I hear back, I don't know anything about these deals. I'm sorry! I'll let you know as soon as I hear from him.  Kate 
 Looks like Mark already changed this to 3/28 to 3/31 - looks good to me. 
 Mike confirmed with Natsource this was a 25MW deal with no broker fee. 
 I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/26/2001 03:22 PM 
 I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 Kim - I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp? 552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?  And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be confirmed.   Diana - I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty. 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, Montana System, etc.), do we confirm? 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that I'm doing this right. Please let me know.  553666 553667 553668 555174 555175 555177 555178 556365 556366 556367 556368 557665 557666 557667 557668 557734 558952 558957 558958 558959 558960  Thank you both for all your help.  Kate 
 I just entered these deals and backdated them -  562162 - buy Duke 562164 - sell Calpine  Sorry about the delay.  Kate 
 Following are EPMI weighted average trade prices for Tues., March 27. After discussing this e-mail with my manager, we've decided to only send the information previously sent via fax. If you have any questions on individual deals, please don't hesitate to call.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for catching that. It should be good now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!  Kate 
 We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 PREBON Matt Motley 562635  Jeff Richter 562556  Jeff Richter 562546 - corrected to 25 mw  BLOOMBERG Mike Driscoll 562546 - Mike would like to keep this as Pinnacle for now because that is the true counterparty - Bloomberg's system has not been updated  Tom Alonso did not do this deal (he did a BUY  with the same terms)  Sean Crandall 562641 
 Mike Driscoll is entering this ICE trade right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 02:08 PM
