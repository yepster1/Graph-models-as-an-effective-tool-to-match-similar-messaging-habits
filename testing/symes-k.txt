 I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through lately. I'm checking with IT on this.  Thanks, Kate  PS - I'll add you to the Deal Correction Report mail list starting today. 
 This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak part.  Let me know if this makes any sense.  Thanks, Kate 
 Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Here you go! 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy. 
 I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks! Kate Symes Enron North America Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Mark just told me this trade was done direct - I've deleted the broker out of deal 573083.  Thanks, Kate 
 one was in with prebon - 572999 - it's been changed to apb 
 Mike checking with his broker right now. 
 It should have been Sierra Power Corp. I've changed it.  Thanks, kate 
 This deal discrepancy seems to have a few of us stumped - so I'm referring it to all of you in hopes that we can solve this today. Following are the terms of the deal:  Short Term California buys Enron Energy Services Hours: HE 6-9 Delivery Point: SP-15 Term: 3/29/01 Price: $110  The deal was entered by Bert Meyers, a Real Time trader, on behalf of STCA. It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of $130, not a buy at a price of $160.  My first instinct was to simply modify the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the price coming across as $130. I'm reluctant to send any more incorrect information to EES, as we've already dealt with enough confusion over this matter. Please take a look at the deal and its corresponding documents, and let me know which is the correct price.  Thanks for your help, Kate 
 598166 - changed to 50 mw  598640 - changed to no broker  598521 - powerex sale changed to prebon for broker 
 Evelyn - Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything should look good now - 571920 now has 25 mwh and 571801 is killed. Let me know if you still see something wrong.  Thanks, Kate 
 This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals.  I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let me know if you have questions.  Thanks, Kate 
 Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He just might get a sweet deal out of it!  Kate 
 Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May? 
 Thanks for the clarification (Mike was a little off!) - we've killed 571801 and restored 571920.  Kate 
 PREBON 571801 was a duplicate of another sale to EES - Mike killed the duplicate (#571920) and kept this deal  AMEREX 572245 - changed to BOM (4/9 - 4/30) 
 deal is in at 260. 
 I'm just sending the sheets that are saved in our system. Bill Williams told me he cleared everything up on the Real Time side yesterday, but if the volumes in these documents still look wrong, please let me know.    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 You are such a renewable energy stud! I'm excited to see you and Elliot transform the way the world thinks of POWER.  K 
 This deal has been autoscheduled and should show up with correct on peak volumes on the new CARP report.  Kate 
 Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good enough for me.  Thanks again, Kate 
 Thanks so much, Willie! 
 I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what you need from us.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than that, on your end.  Thanks, Kate 
 Just a reminder -  We have added a new pub code to EnPower. The code is for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index. Please advise that the Portland West Desk has one deal in the system at this time against that index, and more may follow.  Thanks for your help with entering these prices.  Kate 
 I sent an e-mail to Les Rawson about these deals yesterday, but - oops! - he's not in the office. I just had Stan Cocke enter the unit names in them, so you should see the following in the comments section -  568866 - unit name is Willamett Industries Albany Paper Mill 568864 - unit name is Grays Harbor Paper Mill 568860 - unit name is Las Vegas Cogeneration Facility  Thanks, Kate 
 570801 - changed to NP-15 570473 - added .005 broker fee 570444 - added .005 broker fee 569957 - changed CTPY to Allegheny Energy Supply  Sorry for the delay!  Kate 
 570011 - Prebon said it's their deal 570023 - broker was changed to Prebon 570801 - I'm waiting until after the calc to change del.point to NP 570473 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee 570444 - waiting for calc to add .005 broker fee 569957 - changed in CAPS but not Enpower - waiting for calc  Sorry about all those unfinished ones, but Risk started calcing a while before I got your e-mail, and they're still going. I'll let you know when these deals have been corrected.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you see the changes come through, Mark.  The autoscheduled deals are:  533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 535419 - 3/2/01 535420 - 3/2/01 566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 550208 - 3/15/01    The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet.   +____________ =         1016.75  Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up for March!  Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486 
 changed to Prebon   Stephanie Piwetz   04/04/2001 02:13 PM 
 price changed to 420.00 
 All three if possible.....? 
 I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a problem, and we'll figure something out.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
 It should be COB S/N. 
 Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate way to run the report is showing only term deals. The "Schedule" and "Liquidate" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Kate 
 Good afternoon, IT Wizards -  I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a chance.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Les - I received the following e-mail from Confirms in Houston re: deals for which they need unit names. I sorted through the list and changed the purchases to "no confirm," and these three deals are what's left. Could you add the names in the comments section?  568866 - SELL EWEB AT BPA SYSTEM BORDER 568864 - SELL EWEB AT EWEB SYSTEM BORDER 568860 - SELL LADWP AT MCCULLOUGH  Thanks, Kate 
 Oops - it might help if I actually ATTACHED the attachment. 
 Mark - Attached you'll find the spreadsheet you sent me with notes I've added on each deal discrepancy. Most had already been solved, and a few pertain to Real Time spreadsheets, in which case I'll defer to Bill Williams. Please let me know if you have questions on any of my notes. If not, I believe we should be all set for March.  Thanks for your patience, Kate 
 Congratulations, Dave! 
 whaaaa? it's the end of a long day - i can't decipher these rhyming puzzles. 
 sure thing - you looked like you could use a little late afternoon pick-me-up. 
 I'm interested!  Kate 
 broker is right - changed to Allegheny Energy Supply - formerly Merrill Lynch 
 568843 - added fee of .0275, but Sean Crandall believes price should stay at 300.00  569178 - changed broker from APB to Prebon  569021 - changed broker from APB to Bloomberg  569270 - changed broker from APB to Amerex    Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 02:05 PM 
 BLOOMBERG 569021 - changed to Bloomberg  PREBON Tom Alonso checked with broker - Tom Alonso did not do this deal - Jeff Richter did a similar one but it is with Williams, not Reliant......???  Jeff Richter closest deal I can see is 569178 - all same terms except it's at NP not SP  AMEREX Mike Swerzbin 569315 - added Amerex as broker 
 Bill Williams just talked to Jake, the Sempra trader who did the trade, who recognized the deal and said he'd speak with Harry and clear it up. In the meantime, this is a good trade.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 10:47 AM 
 These are the latest figures I have - I'm so sorry for the delay! I'm calling Willie Harrell in Global Risk right now to determine why these prices are not yet in pub posting and how we can come up with a more reliable system.  Kate 
 I just called and left a message with Harry - I'll let you know if we're able to figure it out.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 11:35 AM 
 Leaf finished his shift at 6 a.m. today - he'll be back at 6 p.m. But I talked to Bill Williams about it and he saw the trade in the Real Time log, and said he remembers hearing Leaf do the trade with Sempra. If you have a number for Harry at Sempra, I'd be glad to give him a call and figure this out. Let me know.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/03/2001 10:47 AM

 This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark "no confirm" on these deals as well.  Thanks, Kate

 It looks like one of our schedules got cut. I'm checking with Phil Platter on this one, and I'll let you know when I find out.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
 DUDE! You're too good to be true. Between you and my roommates, the emanation of love germs is almost too much to handle. Hey, if you get this in the next half an hour, write back with your phone number and I'll call you when I get off work. (I'm leaving at 5 p.m. ON THE DOT today....whooo, hooo!)

 I'm not sure what's going on with these options, but I entered them as 2 PM expiry, then got a message that they were 2 AM from Stephanie Piwetz this morning, changed them AGAIN, and now they're back to 2 AM. I've changed them again, but I honestly have no idea why they keep going back. Please let me know if you see the expiry as 2 PM now.  Thanks, Kate 
 Here's the information I received from Les re: unit contingent deals. Obviously, we'll still enter the specific unit name in these deals, but this could be used as a point of reference.  Kate 
 I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request, but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of commmand?  Thanks, Kate 
 Call with questions -  Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 Les - I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or add the unit names.  Thanks, Kate 
 These have both been changed to Enmax Energy Corp. I'll let the Real Time traders know.  Thanks, Kate 
 Please add to this a request for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index price. Thanks.  Kate 
 It's been changed to 250 - Chris is going to talk to Bloomberg, though, because he thought it was a deal for 247. I'll let you know what they work out. 
 The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you can do.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Hey, it worked! I have no idea what happened, but it looks great. Thanks for checking it out.  Kate 
 it's been changed.   Stephanie Piwetz   03/30/2001 11:07 AM 
 Anytime! I try to at least PRETEND to the traders that we have civilized correspondence. Little do they know......  Kate 
 I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks Eric. I've changed the sheet to include your phone number. And you have a great weekend too!  Kate 
 Mark - I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and price.  The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet and EnPower.  Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.  Kate 503-464-7486 
 These are all West Services deals, and our services traders - Les Rawson and Stan Cocke - prefer to confirm their own deals with counterparties. So these should not be confirmed. Kim Hundl and I have been working on long lists of deals that went in to be confirmed and we've since gone in and changed them. Services, Real Time, and EES trades are among those. If you'd like, you can talk to her about what we decided to confirm and not confirm, or you can give me a call at (503) 464-7486.  Thanks for checking! Kate 
 Following are the terms under which I ran the Forward Obligation report and received this message:  General SQL error. ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis.  Terms:    Let me know what you find. Thanks!  Kate 
 Please note a change in EES reported load volume on 3/31, HE 6, SP-15. The volume was incorrectly copied into the worksheet, but all EnPower deals reflect the correct number. Also, the sheets for 3/30 and 3/31 now show those respective dates at the top of the page. Please let me know if there are any questions. 
 You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show up correctly for some reason.  Thanks, Kate 
 I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney, because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday. Cara asked me to e-mail you with the specifics for any scheduling adjustments that need to be made. And here they are -  563929 - KILLED  476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April  Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs. Let me know if you have any questions.  Kate 
 The unit on this deal is Las Vegas Cogeneration - and I asked Les to start entering the specific unit in the comments section of unit-contingent deals. Let me know if he does or does not.....  Thanks, Kate

 Amy - I'd be very interested in participating in the Applied Energy Derivatives class. Please let me know if there is still room, and if there's anything else I need to do to sign up.  Thanks, Kate 
 he just changed it to 4/2 
 564894 - changed to Bloomberg - but it's a buy, not a sale - is this the same deal prebon is missing? 
 Done. 
 I'm checking with Chris Foster and Chris Mallory, who are apparently the ones initiating these trades. Both are out of the office right now, so it might be tomorrow before I can get back to you on this. But my guess is that if APX does not want to receive confirms on daily deals, then we don't need to send them. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.  Thanks, Kate 
 Following are the deals I changed to the correct time zones, per Will Smith's list:  520330 - forward 373613 - forward 359846 - EOL 353314 - EOL 352613 - EOL 349391 - EOL 349389 - EOL 349242 - EOL 330282 - EOL 300686 - forward 272524.2 - forward 220845 - forward  Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I made sure to choose "no" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.  Thanks, Kate 
 Thanks so much! I'll pass this along to the traders.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/29/2001 11:52 AM 
 Bob's at lunch right now - I've left a big note on his desk and we'll sort it out this afternoon. Thanks for the reminder.  Kate 
 I'm sorry for not resonding sooner - did this get resolved? I see Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in the deal.  Kate 
 The folowing EES sleeves have been entered and backdated to yesterday:  564924 - buy EES 564925 - sell Allegheny 564926 - buy EES 564927 - sell Allegheny 564928 - buy EES 564929 - sell Mirant  Sorry for the delay - I didn't realize Chris had been sitting on them for so long.  Thanks, Kate 
 These have been auto-scheduled, and I've told the confirms group not to confirm them. Let me know what the Nov. and Dec. deal numbers are when you get them.  Kate 
 Les - Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be much appreciated.  Thanks, Kate 
 According to Les, we don't need to confirm any of these deals. I guess they were deals done by the Real Time desk on behalf of Services, but they were entered incorrectly. Thanks for checking, though.  Kate 
 563262 4 units to Willamette Industries Albany Paper Mill Unit 4 units to Grays Harbor Paper Unit  563259 All units to Las Vegas Cogeneration  Please let me know if this answers your question.  Thanks, Kate 
 Brett -  I'm so sorry for not sending you an e-mail last night! I did test the report and it looks just fine - but I had so many things going on right up until I left that I forgot to tell YOU that it looked fine. Thanks for the reminder, and for your work on the report.  Kate 
 I wanted to check with you on this. All these deals are entered in your book, and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with counterparties. However, these deals have comments in them that say they replace other deals. In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston? Let me know.  Thanks, Kate 
 563906 - changed to Pinnacle West 563907 - changed to Pinnacle West 562226 - changed to APS  Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for your help.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/29/2001 07:17 AM 
 I'll change this when Risk is done calcing - but APB is right - broker fee should be .00275 on LADWP deals.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/28/2001 03:26 PM 
 Thanks for the response! I know the feeling......(is it only Wednesday?) 
 The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning.  The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, per Matt Motley who did the trades.  And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/28/2001 02:57 PM 
 Mark says it's a good deal - any reason why it didn't get checked out? 
 AMEREX  Diana Scholtes 563461 - should be amerex/in as prebon/changed  Chris Mallory 563362 - he changed it to Prebon  PREBON  Chris Mallory 563461 - changed to amerex 563358 - killed/new heavy load deal entered - 563967 
 In regards to the e-mail you just sent - this is the most recent information I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?  Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.  I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 28th.  Thanks, Kate 
 done 
 Chris entered that this morning - 562978 - would you like me to back-date it?  Kate 
 Let me know if this works.  Kate 
 Question, comments, concerns.....  Kate Symes 503-464-7486 
 help! 
 Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other EnPower" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 A heads up -  The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a 50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15. This is due to an option that Sean and Diana decided not to exercise. Thought that might clear up at least one of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....  Kate 
 This was one of a slew of deals that one of our schedulers ran across that had the wrong time zone in the strips. According to Duong Luu, there was an EOL application error that was incorrectly populating deals that flow over 4/1/01 - the first of day of Daylight Savings Time. Duong said the error has since been fixed. But for the incorrect deals, we had to go in and change all the strips back to PPT and re-save the deals so the time zones would populate correctly. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion - but nothing should change other than that the MWH will be flowing on the correct hours now. Let me know if you have any questions.

 Mike Driscoll is entering this ICE trade right now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 02:08 PM 
 PREBON Matt Motley 562635  Jeff Richter 562556  Jeff Richter 562546 - corrected to 25 mw  BLOOMBERG Mike Driscoll 562546 - Mike would like to keep this as Pinnacle for now because that is the true counterparty - Bloomberg's system has not been updated  Tom Alonso did not do this deal (he did a BUY  with the same terms)  Sean Crandall 562641 
 We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!  Kate 
 I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for catching that. It should be good now.  Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/27/2001 11:52 AM 
 Following are EPMI weighted average trade prices for Tues., March 27. After discussing this e-mail with my manager, we've decided to only send the information previously sent via fax. If you have any questions on individual deals, please don't hesitate to call.  Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 I just entered these deals and backdated them -  562162 - buy Duke 562164 - sell Calpine  Sorry about the delay.  Kate 
 Kim - I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp? 552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?  And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be confirmed.   Diana - I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty. 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, Montana System, etc.), do we confirm? 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General System, do we confirm? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that I'm doing this right. Please let me know.  553666 553667 553668 555174 555175 555177 555178 556365 556366 556367 556368 557665 557666 557667 557668 557734 558952 558957 558958 558959 558960  Thank you both for all your help.  Kate 
 I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.  Thanks, Kate 
 I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.  Thanks, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   03/26/2001 03:22 PM 
 Looks like Mark already changed this to 3/28 to 3/31 - looks good to me. 
 I've left a message for Jeff, but I can't seem to find him or his trade log anywhere. Until I hear back, I don't know anything about these deals. I'm sorry! I'll let you know as soon as I hear from him.  Kate 
 That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.  Thanks for catching that, Kate   Stephanie Piwetz   05/01/2001 07:48 AM 
 535228 - broker fee added per Tom Alonso 
 Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her number is 703-853-3001.  I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said.  I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.  Kate 
 517814 - added .0075 fee per Chris Mallory  535228 - I'm waiting for Tom's desk to settle down a bit - they're in the middle of trading.  Any idea why APB's just checking these deals out now? They're from the beginning of February. Just wondering.  Thanks, Kate 
 These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be specified as CAISO firm.  Thanks, Kate 
 Both have been changed to CAISO energy - we have two new Real Time guys training at the same time. Scary!  Thanks, Kate 
 Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:  1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask Jeff?  2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"  3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?  4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed deals as well?  Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. Thanks for your help!  Kate 
 I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me know if that sounds good.  Kate 
 I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part of the time zone glitch?  Kate 
 We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have to get in the habit of doing it.  Thanks again, Kate 
 The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.    Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 Amy - This is a copy of the job description you sent out to the floor when I took the Deal Control position. I've modified it slightly to reflect some of my own observations of the position.  There is a position available in Deal Control, reporting to Jeff Richter and the Short Term California desk. If you're interested in applying, please contact Amy FitzPatrick by (INSERT DATE HERE).  Following is a summary of the responsibilities associated with this position:  To facilitate the entry of West Power deals, including short term and long term desks and the services desk, into the trading systems. Follow-up with Deal Clearing Settlements groups in Houston to verify accuracy of trades in the system.  This includes timely follow-up with the traders for clarification. Ensure that all trades are entered by a daily deadline. Calculate and report weighted averages of daily price and volume to Dow Jones. Prepare and distribute daily reports to ensure all books are balanced and report discrepancies to management. Track and report daily and monthly error discrepancies to management and deliver reports for possible solutions to rectify errors. Calculate weighted averages between brokered trades and trades executed through Enron OnLine and the Intercontinental Exchange. Report any technical mishaps to appropriate personnel in Houston and track computer problems until demonstrated resolutions. Test any updated versions of applications requested by programmers and report back any adjustments needed.  The most important attributes one must possess to succeed in this position are persistance and a positive attitude. Working knowledge of Microsoft Excel is essential, as is a general software aptitude.  How does that sound? Let me know if you need more.  Thanks, Kate 
 I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been fixed. Thanks for clarifying this.  Kate 
 I just got your fax - thank you! I'll start changing over those deals right now, so it shouldn't be long. I'll send you another e-mail when they're all done.  Kate 
 Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, kate 
 It's been changed. Thanks!  Kate 
 Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....  I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with "us." I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have to go. I'll call you tonight!  Take care, kate 
 The last two LTNW deals - 349864 and 318870 are changed to correct time zones. They gave me the option to choose "no" for rerouting of schedules. They were both EOL deals.  Kate 
 Original...original...original. 
 I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.  534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 mw per hour  559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak hours 559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak hours  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.  Thanks for your patience, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
 just added - 559276 
 The contact for Fresno Cogen is Ken Salvagno - phone number is 916-447-5171.  Thanks, Kate 
 Find out what your theme song is - it only takes a second. And keep in mind it could be something extremely fitting like Todd's - "My Boyfriend's Back." 
 503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.  Kate 
 That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. Mike's exact wor
