stions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email. I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?  I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.  Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
  Can you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.  It looks like it left my account.  Also can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?  It doesn't look like its in the account either. 
 Rod,  Do you know how to get in touch with Paul Cherry or Dan Fancler over the weekend? I have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.  I need to have someone run a payables list.  I can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103 
  Thanks for your information and words of reassurance.  Here is my email address:  work shelley.corman@enron.com  home cormanerb@cs.com 
  FYI - This is what the supply breakdown looks like for FPL without ENA in the equation 
  Just got off the phone with Jennie and I know you already talked to her.  My direct flight tomorrow cleared so I plan on taking it.  I will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th & then we can spend some of our waiting time together. 
  It's been a few days now since ENA dropped their gas supply from ENA from 250M down to approx 75-85M and FPL has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ENA gas and still keeping its nominations at 800M.  Here is a quick snapshot of where FPL is sourcing there gas from:  ENA					85 Exxon					35 SNG					48 Destin				92 Western Gas 			30 Dynegy				40 Oneok					25 BP Amoco				153 El Paso				96 Aquila				20 Duke					26 Coral					20 Cinergy				20 Sempra				25 Bridgeline				15 National Energy			15  Delivered Gas: FGU					15 Reliant				31 Energy Authority			7 NUI					30 Total FPL Supply			828 Less: FPL Energy Services		21 Total FPL Deliveries		807  (774 Firm + 33) 
  Good morning all.  Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me? 
  Revised presentation for the meeting this afternoon 
 Gary,  Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control. 
 FYI 
 Please verify that this is taken care of and that I do not need to have someone in my group work on this.  Thanks. 
  Need to talk to you about this 
  I'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $181.17 deduct from my 12/31 paycheck. 
 FYI 
 Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities - They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so. - They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.  We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard will be checking everyones card prior to entry.  We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.  We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation Center (EB42C1).  2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone  We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS.  On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured for approximately two weeks, depending on events. 
  Here is the presentation for the 2:30 meeting today

NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.  3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.  4.

  FYI - I made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together TW/NNG revenue summaries for review by the bankers that Rod/Kevin are working with.  Thought you might me interested in the report.  It gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties. 
  The Phase VI upgrade wasn't on the list of projects that Gary submitted, but not to worry as you will see on the attached it is and always has been part of my overall Gas Logistics capital budget.

  Diane,  Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system.  And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Shelley Corman x37083 
  Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650. 
  FYI - Thought you might be interested in Gary Smith's response to these questions 
 I keep getting these notes.  Help! 
 Jean -- I keep getting these messages.  I just got another batch of 6 similar reminders 
  First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers). 
   Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.  Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.  At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.  Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.  I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season. 
 Please come by to sign the certificates. 
 Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.  My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.  But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.  I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.  Can you recommend an ENT?  Looking forward to seeing you soon. 
  Hi Becky,  I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.  I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.  She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.  Shelley 
  Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow).   This is all a shock. I will have to travel by myself.  I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited.  I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs.   I am very excited to see you though.  Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow.  Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday.  I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days.  But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston.  So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work.  I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer.  I will bring pictures of your visit this summer.  I will also bring warm clothes!  I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz.  I am so happy to hear that she has a family. 
 Hi Sherene,  Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- b
