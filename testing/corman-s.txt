 Kevin, We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish. 
  Jayshree,  I j found three more minor nits. 
 Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number.  In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth. 
 We should change all refernces to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues .  I changed that in one prior draft.  The other figure is the top 15 contracts.  I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

  Thanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price. 
 Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange).  I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.  Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen?  Are they the designee?  Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?

  We received a call this morning from a gentleman, Todd Bearden (954-981-1101), who recently moved into a home in Hollywood FL and is trying to obtain information about gas service, could one of you pass this request on the appropriate person at NUI-City Gas or TECO/PGS?

  Please coordinate a meeting next week between Don Hawkins, myself and Rod Hayslett for Don & I to discuss a proposal for NNG Measurement with Rod. 
 Another concern I have is that once we say that we can path -- then we've lost our best argument against physical segmentation. 
 Don,  I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.  With respect to the specific project listed:  1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.   With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:  2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.  3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.   An additional footnote should be added to the page.  4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements. 
 Rod,  I received Don's memo before I sent out the memo that we had talked about -- so I turned the thoughts into reply comments. 
 FYI 
  Would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.  The Audubon lady said that I can sign Chad up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.  Summer Schedule I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  June 10-14 is Grace VBS  We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7  Ashford VBS July 22-26  Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.

  FYI  Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff. 
 Great.  Last week I was invited to a forum, but I was disappointed that I could not attend. 
  I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention. 
 Wednesday will work best for me.  Say 11:45 at the Daily Review? 
  Would one of be able to email this gentleman.  He called me again this morning looking for information on connecting a well to Northern. 
  Ricki - would you please:  1. Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for Judy Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt  2. Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow  3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).  Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself 
 I'm confused how this fits in with the projects that we recently had Dynegy approve.  Is this one of the discretionary network upgrade projects that they agreed to support?  Or one of the other discretionary projects that we didn't have funding for before 6/30/02 anyway? 
 I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.  We just pulled schedules from the web.  My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.  I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us .... but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

  Ann,  Per Rod Hayslett, you are able to process changes to list B to accommodate instances in which Dynegy & ETS can agree on the specific assignment of an individual.  Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva are both currently company 179 employees.  We moved both of these individuals to list C because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for TW.  Craig Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B.  Dave Neubauer has requested that Craig be moved to list B and both Rick Dietz (Craig's immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.  And, if we agree to move Craig to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for Esther DaSilva.  Dave Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.  Accordingly, please move Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva from List C to List B.  FYI - we will use another contract position vacancy to cover TW deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary.  Thanks Shelley 
 Don - I never heard anything back.  Is everyone ok with these clarifications?

 Galen/Jim,  Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.   A couple of further things that I need: - I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?  Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.   Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week. 
 Thanks.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Can you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team.  It was in the budget and we had the okay, but now I'm hearing there is some hold-up & the units are stored on 44.  Shelley 
 Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week. 
  I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.  The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:  1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.  2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.  Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.

 No change.  We are to retain all documents. 
 I'm okay with providing your attached sheet to Jane 
 Great.  Just wanted to make sure I was on the right wave length -- as Jane Joyce has asked the IT folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and I didn't want to lead the IT folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect. 
 You are going to be so very mad at me, but I have lost my ATM card.  Can you cancel my card.  I think this proves that I am no allowed to have an ATM card in the future.  Call me. 
 It's been canceled.  There were no unauthorized withdrawals.  It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.  The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features. 
 Fantastic.  Is Sheila planning to attend?  If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed.  If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list.  I will take 2 seats.  Please give me the invites for those two.  I'll take care of their transport.  They will not need Enron transport. 
 Still working...for today anyway. We spent a cold weekend in Conroe TX.  Alina was well-behaved all weekend.  Can you do lunch this week?  Perhaps tomorrow? 
 Okay with me

 I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).  We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute. 
 Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.  I'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.  Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.  FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.  I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility). 
 Thanks I found this too. 
 Jim  I would be happy to do my usual Spring bedding flower planting, but I will be out of town on our Spring break trip on Sat.  Mar 9.

 OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.  Summary notes from Tom Mertz -There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility. - Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications. - The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore. - Going to do fly over. - Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard.

Docket No. RM98-10-000  Gas Transportation Services                   ?   Regulation of Interstate Natural                       ?                Docket No. RM98-12-000 Gas Transportation Services                   ?    MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES   Pursuant to the March 21, 2001 Notice of Petition in the above-referenced proceedings and Rules 212, 212 and 214 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("Commission") regulations (18 C.F.R. ? 385.211, 385.212  and 385.214 ), the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March 16, 2001 Petition of the American Gas Association ("AGA Petition").  I. All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:  Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188 Phone:  713-853-7083 Email:  shelley.corman@enron.com  Nancy E. Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC  20006 Phone:  202-466-9148 Email:  nancy.bagot@enron.com  II. MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines. 2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines. The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest. III. COMMENTS The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein. Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates. Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights. For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

  Jennifer,  Regrettably I will not be able to attend the April 19 meeting of the dinner.  Please pass my best wishes on to both Dean Dutton and Professor Kleit for a successful meeting.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
  The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.  There are three main principles behind the current rules: 1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and 3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.  There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.  So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions. 
 New rules propose to: 1. Expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate 2. Require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates 
 Thanks, I needed a little bedtime reading!

  Ricki - I don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that I pitched to HR and Lynn and Donna are out -- so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon? 
  Hi Bev,  Just checking in.  What is the latest on your travel time frame?  Hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you.  Shelley 
 Or are you still swamped from being out of the office. 
 Let me know how your Drs appt goes.  I'll have to let you know later about Fri.  -- got some scheduling things up in the air. 
 Let me know what you think about April 12 as a possible San Marcos date.  Second choice would be April 5. 
   I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.  Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing. 
 I have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.  This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us. 
 Great 
 Are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets (est. cost $10,000)?  Would need to be split 10 ways to be doable? 
  Here's my first stab   Key Findings 1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close 2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through 3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF. 4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.   Recommendations  1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics). 2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters. 3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close. 4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist. 
  I can make that work for Chad if that is when Drew is available.  I assume you are talking about Wk of June 24? 
 I agree with your strategy

 April 20, 2001    Maintenance of Houston, Inc. 6220 West Park, Suite 106 Houston, TX 77057  Dear Mr. _____________,  By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.  In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.  It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.  Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.     Sincerely    Shelley Corman, on behalf of Ashford United Methodist Trustees    cc: Cindy Lewis, Church Office

 Teb - would you have time to brainstorm with me on some middle of the road rate treatment scenarios on Monday? 
  Stan told me that you were using that title too.  So I guess perhaps I negotiated another thing as well.  Seriously though I would like to talk to you about using common titles. 
 Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.  Here is the short version.  Yes I have a new job.  But, surprise, it's still at Enron.  I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.  We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences.

 Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.  I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.  Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim. 
 I don't plan to attend the NNG customer accts meeting 
 Yes -  I will be moving to Steve's old offices 
 Thanks for your support.  I'm sure that I'll be taking you up on your offer soon.

 Liz,  I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.  This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.   Shelley 
 We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!  If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?  Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there). 
   I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses. 
 I now  have another meeting over the lunch hour.  Perhaps another day this week? 
 Rick,  When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?  Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.  Thanks  Shelley 
 If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity. We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.  FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.  ! -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

  I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices.
