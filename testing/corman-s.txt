    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION     Regulation of Short-Term Natural                       ?            Docket No. RM98-10-000  Gas Transportation Services                   ?   Regulation of Interstate Natural                       ?                Docket No. RM98-12-000 Gas Transportation Services                   ?    MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES   Pursuant to the March 21, 2001 Notice of Petition in the above-referenced proceedings and Rules 212, 212 and 214 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("Commission") regulations (18 C.F.R. ? 385.211, 385.212  and 385.214 ), the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March 16, 2001 Petition of the American Gas Association ("AGA Petition").  I. All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:  Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188 Phone:  713-853-7083 Email:  shelley.corman@enron.com  Nancy E. Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC  20006 Phone:  202-466-9148 Email:  nancy.bagot@enron.com  II. MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines. 2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines. The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest. III. COMMENTS The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein. Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates. Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights. For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

  Jennifer,  Regrettably I will not be able to attend the April 19 meeting of the dinner.  Please pass my best wishes on to both Dean Dutton and Professor Kleit for a successful meeting.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
  The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.  There are three main principles behind the current rules: 1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and 3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.  There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.  So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions. 
 New rules propose to: 1. Expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate 2. Require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates 
 Thanks, I needed a little bedtime reading! 
 No material impact .  The filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
  Ricki - I don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that I pitched to HR and Lynn and Donna are out -- so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon? 
  Hi Bev,  Just checking in.  What is the latest on your travel time frame?  Hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you.  Shelley 
 Or are you still swamped from being out of the office. 
 Let me know how your Drs appt goes.  I'll have to let you know later about Fri.  -- got some scheduling things up in the air. 
 Let me know what you think about April 12 as a possible San Marcos date.  Second choice would be April 5. 
   I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.  Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing. 
 I have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.  This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us. 
 Great 
 Are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets (est. cost $10,000)?  Would need to be split 10 ways to be doable? 
  Here's my first stab   Key Findings 1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close 2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through 3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF. 4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.   Recommendations  1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics). 2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters. 3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close. 4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist. 
  I can make that work for Chad if that is when Drew is available.  I assume you are talking about Wk of June 24? 
 I agree with your strategy

 April 20, 2001    Maintenance of Houston, Inc. 6220 West Park, Suite 106 Houston, TX 77057  Dear Mr. _____________,  By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.  In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.  It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.  Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.     Sincerely    Shelley Corman, on behalf of Ashford United Methodist Trustees    cc: Cindy Lewis, Church Office

 Teb - would you have time to brainstorm with me on some middle of the road rate treatment scenarios on Monday? 
  Stan told me that you were using that title too.  So I guess perhaps I negotiated another thing as well.  Seriously though I would like to talk to you about using common titles. 
 Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.  Here is the short version.  Yes I have a new job.  But, surprise, it's still at Enron.  I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.  We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences. 
 I am going to be available in a few minutes -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

  Please approve these requests 
 Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.  I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.  Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim. 
 I don't plan to attend the NNG customer accts meeting 
 Yes -  I will be moving to Steve's old offices 
 Thanks for your support.  I'm sure that I'll be taking you up on your offer soon. 
  Sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby.  I just had my head in the clouds.  Have a great evening! -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I am avialable tomorrow afternoon.  Will 2 PM ET work for you?  Will you call me or should I call you? -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Liz,  I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.  This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.   Shelley 
 We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!  If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?  Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there). 
   I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses. 
 I now  have another meeting over the lunch hour.  Perhaps another day this week? 
 Rick,  When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?  Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.  Thanks  Shelley 
 If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity. We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.  FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.  ! -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I am out of town on business tonight.  I saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply.  Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.  I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.  I didn't hear from Ginger this week.  I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.

 Here is my mark-up.  Please make sure that it is factually correct. 
  I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices. 
 Drew - In your new organization is Frazier the marketing affiliate attorney= ?  or Hartsoe?  We need to continue to refine the procedure for posting upd= ates.  For example this week I found some overdue changes that needed to be= made to the website. =20

 I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.  This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......
