 BY MARK GOLDEN A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN  NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED. "THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE," SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.

"IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED," SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER. ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAP
