nd the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.  Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?  Paul 
 Oscar,  Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:  LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh  LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)  No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 131,850 Btu/gallon)   Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.  Call me if you have any additional questions.   Regards,  Paul 
 Harib,  Attached is the latest update for the DPC project. A printed copy of the attached document with photos is being forwarded to you seperately. I will be responsible for sending you the monthly updates in the future. Also, I am planning a trip to the Middle East at the end of March and the beginning of April. I hope to meet with you at that time. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713 345-5855.  Best Regards,  Paul

 Oscar,  Please also provide updates of No.2 and LPG inventories.  Paul 
 Sounds like a great trip.  I'm going to have to work on Renee about diving. Masks (anything around her face) make her claustrophobic (spelling???). She can wear a ski mask, however, so she can probably get used to a scuba mask.  Have a great time.  Paul

 The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.  Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:  1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less  2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end  3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days  The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.
