 Rajesh,  Have you been able to get a draft COU agreement from Clay?  How is your move coming?   Paul 
 OK with me. 
 Jaime,  Have you tried Gus Luna or Debbie Keller with Edison Mission? Gus was handling the actual transactions. I kept my own calculations of the settlement amounts but Gus should have copies of the settlement invoices from Enron.  Paul 
 Jimmy,  Shubh Shrivastava suggested that I contact you regarding getting on the distribution list for news articles relating to the DPC project. I work for Wayne Perry in Houston in the LNG group. We will be performing the services under the Fuel Management Agreement. I am, of course, very interested in reading what the Indian press is printing about the current state of the project.  Thanks,  Paul

  Tushar,  Are you on the distribution list for these news clips?  Paul 
 Tushar,  I only know what I read in the press. Sounds like they want to give the govt a little more time to come to their senses.  Paul

  Ernesto,  Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.  We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.  Regards,  Paul 
  How do your calendars look June 7-15 for meeting with the guys from OLNG? They are interested in a visit to CMS. Possibly they could be there for the Hoegh Galleon unloading.  Please let me know your date preferences and the names of anyone else that should attend the meetings.  Paul 
  Please see attached spreadsheet that we can discuss later.   Paul

  Yaqoob,  I hope that all is well with you. I have made some changes to your document. Pardon me for the fact that I cannot seem to draw in the lines as well as you. Therefore, I left them out.

Call me if you wish to discuss this or anything.  Best Regards,  Paul 
 Shubh,  The only publication that I have been getting is World Gas Intelligence published by Energy Intelligence Group. I can FAX you my latest copy if you are interested. Also, they have a web site:  www.energyintel.com  Poten & Partners' main number in New York is 212 230-2000. Also, there is a sample issue of LNG in World Markets at www.poten.com. I spoke with Lizette Valentin (Poten) and she says the lowest cost way for you to get the publication is to be added on to Clay Harris's subscription for $500/year. Lizette's number is 212 230-2086. The website also has the form that you need to fill out to get added on to Clay's subscription.  Call me and we can look at the website together.  I am also anxious to get some news regarding the lenders' meeting in Singapore.  Take Care,  Paul 
  Shubh,  When you get to the Poten Home Page, do the following:  click		"click here to continue" point to		"services" click 		"LNG" click		"Reports &
