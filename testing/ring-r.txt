 there would be any problems, but to get t= he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat= ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t= he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the= following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O= ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f= rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI= that "Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of= financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o= f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic= h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c= ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic= ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th= erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information = to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them."  According to Da= n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the= Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ= ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter = occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was= automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, = when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a= ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem= ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,= and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc= idence.  According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce= edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso= lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE= .  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to= EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti= is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re= presentatives from ISO-NE.  I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to De= nise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak wit= h Molly as they all work together. =20  Let me know if you need any additional information.
