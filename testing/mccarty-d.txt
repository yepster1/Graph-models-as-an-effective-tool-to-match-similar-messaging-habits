g.  Is it scheduled to be paid?  Dan 
 See if you can figure out how to get into this??  Dan 
 Steve, This is landing at a bad time.  I'm going to be in Omaha going over the 2002 plan, and doing other business.  Unfortunately, I cannot reschedule this one so I'll have to miss the Wine fest. 
 Stan, Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.

 Eric, Do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in?  Dan 
 Cindy, Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.  Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the
