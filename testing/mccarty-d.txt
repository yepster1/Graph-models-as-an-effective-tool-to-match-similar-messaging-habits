e losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.  Dan 
 Mark, Would you send me a copy of your announcement?  Thanks. Dan 
 It's up to you now. 
 Steve, I'd like to get one of the blackberry wireless handhelds.  How can I get one? Dan 
 Eric, Should I call Dennis, will he call me, or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize?  Dan 
 Eric, I thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the Withdrawn Partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old Partnership, by a simple modification to Paragraph 1.  I think it's still pretty fuzzy, don't you?  What was wrong with Duke's proposed changes?  Dan 
 Mary Kay, The decision couldn't have been better if we had written it ourselves---another BIG success to add to your 2001 list.  Dan 
 Drew and Steve, Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well?? Dan 
 John, Stan Babiuk of El Paso called again to express their interest in buying Sunniland.  How sure are you that this deal will happen?  Dan

  Brian, Do we have the funds for this?  If so I'd like to proceed on this one.  What capacity do we have for PAA's for the rest of 2002?  Dan

 We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.  With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.  So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep. a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts. Thanks  Dan
