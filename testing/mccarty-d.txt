 Mary Kay, Just a bit of a heads up--It is looking like the Management Conference in November is being cancelled (probably to be rescheduled for after the first of the year).  We should hear something official in the next day or two.  Dan 
 SOOOO--Is it really too late to consider a disaster recovery site that would be safer than Ardmore in the event of flood, bio-terrorism, or other crazy attack, that would be marketable to other companies??  I think that this a question that one should ask one's self if one was just promoted to a lofty position of authority.  Dan 
 I love you. Cool is it not.  -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 John, I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?  Dan 
 John, That is fine, but I'd also like to see current month to Plan as well, as this will be of particular interest next year. Dan 
 Mary Kay, I still haven't forgotten--I'm talking with Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon, and I'll let you know. Dan 
 Mary Kay, I still haven't forgotten about you--I'll be talking to Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon.  I'll give you a call then.  Dan

 Eric, Bob will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.  It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that Bob does have direct access to Stan and me.  This is consistent with what Bill had originally talked to Bob about.  Okay?  Dan

 Shelley, How are your people coming on the TW and NNG contracts?  Sorry about the short notice,  but as usual, it's good that it's in our hands and not someone else's.  Dan 
 Larry, At what point do we consider taking off the '02 hedges?  Is that a game we should play or not? What is your view of market for '01 and '02?  Dan 
 Eric, Here is the IT Backhaul proposal that went to Gonzales.  You'll note that it is for deliveries west of the Florida border. Dan 
 Eric, I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to Audrey after I got a call from Cindy looking to find Julie or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.  Dan

 Eric, Considering the number of fires we have at Enron right now this is about the last thing on Stan's mind.  Hill and Hartsoe are appropriate to be attending this meeting.  Again--I think that this is a bit more of Dennis' overkill.  Do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades?  Dan 
 John, Have Craig give me a call--we have alot of new work being done with PG&E and TW, so he could be quite helpful. Dan 
 Stan, I have it on good authority that Dynegy is making a run at Bob Hayes. My guess is that Bob will call you or me to discuss his status sometime today.  Dan 
 John, I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.  All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.  Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.  Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.  Dan 
 Stan, Last week we coordinated with Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro, Joe Hartsoe and the Washington office, so that they would make sure that our objections (as outlined in Dennis's communication below ) to certain portions of Bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard. They've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the Bingaman hearings. Williams, El Paso and Duke have all done the same.  Dan 
 Not yet.
