will stop. When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia? Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.  Dan 
 Stan, Take a quick glance at this. Dan 
 Stan, The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x  EBITDA  with a valuation more in the range of $180m.  While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.  They have yet to respond.  In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.  Dan 
 Eric, Julie has asked to take vacation on Friday, so we'll need Susan to cover phones, faxes, and general office business on Friday until 6:00 Eastern/ 5:00 Central.  Based on our efforts in Washington this week, Friday could be a very busy day.  Dan 
 Pat, Thanks.  I appreciate the input. Let me know if anything pertaining to the specific routing of the line begins to bubble up.  Dan 
 Greg, I have no interest for ETS. Dan 
 Kim and John, I agree with Kim's second point.  I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.  I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.  Can we clean this language up a little?  Dan 
 Dave, I haven't heard anything about Pacer for quite some time.  Has there been any progress or have we dropped it? Dan 
 Kim and John, I assumed that we'd moved away from that point in favor of the right to match.  Is that not the case? Dan 
 ok 
 Stan, The teleconference today (with TCPL) held nothing really new.  We did agree not to bring in any other third parties, such as El Paso, at this time.  TCPL noted that they would be interested in a roles as the developer (and perhaps as the operator or some or all of the new line), and would also expect to be responsible for all Canadian legal and regulatory matters.  They acknowledged that we have more expertise in the areas of US rates and regulatory and legal, finance, commercial and marketing activities and would expect that we take the lead there.  We are working toward a first cut on a JV structure over the next two weeks.  Dan 
 No interest. 
 Shelley, I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.  Dan 
 Shelley, I was thinking just revenue, but we can just as easily do O&M, too.  Which would you prefer? Dan 
 Dennis, I'm fine with the letter.  And, I think that it should be well received. Dan 
 Yes 
  FYI

 We wouldn't.  I'll talk with Kim. 
 Eric, I'll be talking with John sometime this afternoon. Dan 
 Thanks 
 Eric, FYI, I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once.  I called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call.  I called again today and received no return call.  You may have a good relationship with these guys, but I think that John may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity.  I'll try one more time, then I'll call it quits.  Dan 
 Rod, This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be = changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.  Also, Kent's numbers d= o not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet = that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after th= e project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that= there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  = We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term = market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage = to capture short term market anomalies).  Are you okay with that?  I am.  Dan 
 Martha, Would you drop me a quick note and update me on your progress?  Is there anything that you need to be doing at this point?  Also give me your general feel for the market's receptiveness to date, the caliber of Luminent's staff, and how the relationship is going so far. If you have some available time next week, call Julie and get on my calendar.  Thanks.  Dan 
 Janet, I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.  Dan 
 Janet, Yes, he will be returning as an Associate.  I don't think that Billy is coordinating this trip, but I'll check. Dan 
 Mark, I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.  Dan 
 Mark, Would you send me a copy of your announcement?  Thanks. Dan 
 It's up to you now. 
 Steve, I'd like to get one of the blackberry wireless handhelds.  How can I get one? Dan 
 Eric, Should I call Dennis, will he call me, or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize?  Dan 
 Eric, I thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the Withdrawn Partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old Partnership, by a simple modification to Paragraph 1.  I think it's still pretty fuzzy, don't you?  What was wrong with Duke's proposed changes?  Dan 
 Mary Kay, The decision couldn't have been better if we had written it ourselves---another BIG success to add to your 2001 list.  Dan 
 Drew and Steve, Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well?? Dan 
 John, Stan Babiuk of El Paso called again to express their interest in buying Sunniland.  How sure are you that this deal will happen?  Dan

 We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.  With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.  So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep. a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts. Thanks  Dan
