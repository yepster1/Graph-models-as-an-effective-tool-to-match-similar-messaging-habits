y Subscribed Through Dec 2002; Well-Positioned for Recontracting - No New Rate Case Until November 2006 - Overbuilding into Cal. can compromise resubscription of contracts (not unique to TW)  The slide includes these bullets, a map of TW and a barchart with 1999-2001 throughput.  I asked Gina to change the 90% to 80% in 4th bullet.  How do you feel about the "Maximum Rate Environment ..." bullet? 
 I am planning to take take vacation days on March 8 & 11 and on March 29 & April 1.  Please let me know if there are any scheduling conflicts.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Hello!  I was asleep at the wheel there.  I'll have Gina change that to 85% subscribed on average through 2005.  There is not time period referenced on the max rate statement. 
 Gina needed to finalize, so we deleted the "max rate environment" bullet. 
 This is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.  One more check would be Jeanette Doll.  Jeanette? 
 I tried to find the original spreadsheet that I'm sure you sent me where you calculated these quarterly rates, but I can't find it.  Do you recall these rates?  My question is, I think we used just demand dollars (so I don't think commodity is in here) - how is it that the San Juan rates are above the maximum $.1020?  There really aren't any surcharges for San Juan to Thoreau transactions.  Can you try to look at this to see why the rate might be averaging greater than max?  Thanks!!    1Qtr	2Qtr	3Qtr	4Qtr	Annual West	$0.2577	$0.2557	$0.2626	$0.2499	$0.2565 East	$0.0777	$0.0535	$0.0517	$0.0537	$0.0591 Ignacio	$0.0443	$0.0445	$0.0433	$0.0392	$0.0428 San Juan	$0.1042	$0.1042	$0.1050	$0.1039	$0.1043 
 Thank you! 
 President's Day Holiday on 2/18 and my last Friday off on 2/22.  Thanks Audrey! 
 I am here.  Let me know when you have time to meet today.  So far I'm open. 
 How does this look?  The first slide is the flyer to be distributed to the parents in the kids' bags.  The second slide I'll print to put on a large manila envelope for the each classroom door.  Did I forget any info?  Does it sound voluntary enough?  Let me know your comments and I'll run it past someone in the office this evening or on Monday and try to have the envelopes out on Monday.  I'll collect the checks each evening when I pick-up Sam.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Okay.  I've already drafted some Marketing Strategy stuff that Steve's reviewing.  Let me know when you want to get together to discuss. 
 Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.  Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.    Let me know your comments.  Thanks! 
 That's probably a good idea.  I'll wait until I get our comments. 
 I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)  Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week. 
 Can you help me with addressing some of these issues?  Let's talk after Staff Mtg.  Thanks! 
 FYI, Looks like we have a few adm things to get in place before we can implement. 
 Yes Dad, you did it right!  Hope ya'll are okay.  I'll call you tonight PaPaFlo.  Love You! Lindy 
   Than
