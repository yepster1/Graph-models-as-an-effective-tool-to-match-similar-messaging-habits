I just have a copy of the Amendment.)

I don't have copies of the March 31, 1999 Bloomfield Compression Services Agreement or the September 9, 1996 Bloomfield Operations & Maintenance Agreement  (referenced in the Bisti Agreements).  James, do you have copies?  Who else would have a copies? 
 Lee Huber has located copies of the Bloomfield O&M & Compression Services Agreements and a copy of the Bisti O&M Agreement.  She is giving these copies to Bill Brown. 
 How does this look? 
 Rich, Give me a call when you have a chance to discuss. Thanks, Lindy 
   James, please find the file attached with the SoCal amounts in dispute as we discussed.  Let me know if you need any further assistance.  Richard, We are meeting tomorrow afternoon (internally) to discuss a possible SoCal settlement position.  Could you verify the amounts from March, 2001 through September, 2001 by lunch time tomorrow?  (I was using a combination of a spreadsheet Linda Ward had provided to me a couple months ago and inquiring in the CBS invoice system.  I want to make sure I have the most current information.)  If not, let me know your timing.  Also, have we been billing interest on the disputed amounts?  I don't see anything in the invoice system.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Attached is a spreadsheet where James has calculated the interest owed by SoCal.  The interest totals about $0.5 MM.  We have not been billing interest.  The system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid.  Then, based upon when it's paid, the interest is calculated. 
 The last slide I'm working on is the "Detail of Market Value" slide.  I have a draft completed, but Steve has not been able to review it.  As long as I can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant I should be able to have the presentation to you. 
   Could all y'all check my work =) before I send this out to everyone?  (Scroll-down to the highlighted areas.)  Thank you! 
   Kim asked me to send the attached spreadsheet to you.  It's my listing of TW's firm contracts where I track ROFR.  This is a complete list as of 9-17-01 of all long-term contracts (seasonal or longer).  Any monthly deals may not be included.  Dennis Lee has a report he runs from CBS of all currently effective contracts and contracts with future effective dates for me to cross-check that I have everything.  The first tab "ROFR Criteria" is a complete list of currently effective contracts including (at the bottom) contracts with future effective dates and the Red Rock Expansion contracts.  The receipt and delivery areas are noted.  The tabs following show the subscribed capacity for certain segments of TW's pipe (West of Thoreau, Blanco to Thoreau & Ignacio to Blanco) by month through 2006. 
   Replace slide # 4 ("Reconciliation of 2001 Plan to 2001 3CE") Replace slide # 5 ("Reconciliation of 2001 3CE to 2002 Plan") Insert new slide	# 6 ("Net Commercial Contribution Accountability") Replace slide # 15 ( "Fuel Revenues 2001 vs. 2002", was slide # 14) Insert new slide # 18 ("2002 Strategy") 
 Thanks Mary Kay! 
 How's this? 
 Please print a few copies of this spreadsheet and take them to Tracy in her meeting this morning.  Thanks, Lindy 
 I faxed it to you, but I think I know why it wouldn't print.  Go to Sheet 1(2) - Sorry, it's the revised one. 
 Attached is a revised offer per our conference call yesterday.  The 1st tab is the summary.  The 2nd tab has the calculations (as well as for the other alternatives we discussed). 
 Oh!  Doesn't he just steal your heart?  Thank you for the pictures.  I have the 3rd one on my screen background.  What an angel!  I'm glad you liked everything and it fits.  I hope you can find a tiny little picture of his sweet little face to put in his blue bejeweled frame.  Isn't our Sam a handsome boy!  He says pickle, boat, nose, eyes, daddy's car, grandma (this is when he's referring to Tony with a blanket wrapped around his head like a scarf), milk, water, beans, hush chloe & I get binky.  He is wonderful.  Sam & I are bonding this weekend.  The kids were all 3 going to NYC with Lisa for the weekend, but Anthony doesn't want to go.  So, he's staying with us, but he and Tony are going to the river in Utopia, TX to take Anthony deer hunting for the first time.  They're staying at Tony's grandma's house.  She's very excited to see them. Anthony is very excited and wanted to know if they could get him some "camo" Friday night (it's all about the clothes these days).  That's about all I know.  It's good that you're going into work and getting out of the house.  It sounds like you're hanging in there.  I hope you're able to get some more sleep.  I'm sure it won't seem soon enough, but you will get to sleep again sometime in the next year or so =)  (It does sound like a long time when you say it out loud.  Sorry.  It'll go by fast!)  I'm excited that Khalid will be baptized by your friend.  He sounds like an enlightened man and I think it's nice for him to recognize both your and Ahmed's faith.  Khalid is a lucky baby.  I wish we could be there.  Take care and tell Ahmed hi.  Give Khalid a kiss & a squeeze.  Love, Lindy 
 Let me know if we're syncing-up.  If we're off in June - Dec, check what I have for the Red Rock Adm Ctrc (I know Dennis made some changes.  I think I have the most current, but possibly not.)  Thanks, Lindy 
 Yes, I did receive it, but I was going to call you because it was issued under my previous married name "Lindy H. Currier".  How could I get it issued in the correct name "Lindy Donoho"?  Please let me know. 
   Let me know if you need any help for Thursday's meeting. 
 Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.  Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.  Let me know.  Thanks! 
 You had asked to see a final copy of our presentation.  This is what was sent to Tracy today.  We may have a couple of inserts by Friday.  Please call me or Steve if you have any questions. 
 CAS continues to reserve the capacity under the contract, as if it's not terminated, as long as there is a ROFR flag on the contract.  ROFR indicates that the customer has a contractual right to extend the contract pursuant to certain parameters in the tariff. 
 I have nothing to report.  Thx Lindy 
 Thanks! 
 FYI for our meeting Tuesday, 11/27 at 2:00 with Dave. 
 It had come up in a meeting that TW was being allocated some $$ associated with NNG personnel (probably storage desk in Houston & Omaha and risk management people).  Is there anyway that you can tell us the people (partial people) who are being allocated to TW? 
 I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments. 
 I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "custom
