iated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan Alberta, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes. 
 Either time is good for me. 
 Yes, please.  I need the 2002 At-A-Glance, the smaller one with one month per two pages.  Please see my current calendar on my desk if this does not make sense.  Thanks Audrey! 
 I just wanted to say it was good to see you the other day, though brief =)  Let's get together soon for lunch or something.  I'm missing my Bob time! 
 I can be there. 
 Per our conference call today, here are some ideas to get TW Settlement Value.  1.	SoCal to commit to TW to let us schedule transport at the SoCal/Topock (South Needles) delivery point.  2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).  3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.  4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red Rock Expansion in-service.  5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).  6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.  7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.  8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San Juan lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it). 
 Can we all plan to get on the phone with Maria tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with Elizabeth about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.  Elizabeth, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call Maria?  Thanks! 
 Maria, Please let me know when  you can meet tomorrow.  TK is out tomorrow through Dec 26th, but we can't meet this afternoon because Elizabeth is out today.  So, let me know when Elizabeth & I can get with you tomorrow. 
 Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.  THANK YOU!!  Lindy 
 Kevin needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI Kevin, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.) 
 In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible.  One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in "constrained" areas on TW.  Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting? 
 The total number would be $330,000 per year. 
 Thanks for your prompt response! 
 Where is Lisa's Office? 
 Thanks Glen! 
 I took 3 vacation days 12/4, 12/5 & 12/6.  Thanks Audrey! 
 Thank you for all of your help!  I appreciate your quick response.  Lindy 
 Amy & Ahmed, Thank you so much for the pictures of Khalid.  We are so disappointed we will not get to see him at Christmas.  Maybe we can plan a trip to Memphis sometime in the coming year.  I wanted to let you know that we've sent a box of "stuff" to your house.  They are hand-me-downs from Sammy - clothes & his whirlin' twirlin' garden.  Please feel free to sell in a garage sale or donate anything you don't want/need.  Hopefully he can get some use out of some things. How are you all?  Getting ready for the trip to Omaha?  Are you driving or flying?  Everyone is good here.  We will get the kids Friday and have them until the evening of Christmas Eve.  Sam is having a Christmas party at school this Thursday.  I'm going to be baking cookies for that.  Sam is wonderful!!  He is the sweetest boy.  I've finally figured-out the digital camara, so I'll try to send some pic's soon. Take care.  We love & miss you.  Lindy 
 Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights. The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.  Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing). 
 Craig, What is the definition of "non-standard" for your purposes?  Give me a call to discuss and I'll verify. (X36007) Thanks! Lindy 
 Thanks for setting this up! 
 We spoke briefly with Randy this morning and let him know that Richardson took the gas in Dec the 22-31.  He was okay with this.  He wants to wait to change the volume until the 12th.  We told him you would let him know later today the amount he should nominate for Jan 12-31.  Here's our calculation.  Please confirm or correct and forward to Randy when you get in this afternoon.  Thanks!  January amount		361,708 December amount	112,452 ----------- Total			474,160 Sched 1/1-1/11*		186,129 ----------- Sched 1/12-1/31		288,031  *Still assuming 21,447 for 1/11.   Daily Sched 1/12-1/31	 14,402 
 Please mark me down for: 1/1	Holiday 1/2	Sick Day 1/3	Vacation Day (8 hours) 1/4	"Friday Off" Thanks, Lindy 
 Could you run that report for me of the current and future effective firm contracts on TW?  Thank you! Lindy 
 Yes.  I have 3:00-4:00 on my calendar for Thursday, October 25th.  Please let me know the location. 
 Thank you for your quick response =) 
 Hi Ken!  I heard in our Staff Mtg that you were "going over to the other side"  =)  I will miss you, but I wish you good luck.  When you have a minute, call me and let me know your reflections on your new opportunity.  I hope you're doing okay - going with the flow.  Who knows - in a few months we could be reunited - stranger things have happened!  Lindy 
 Absolutely!  Currently, my title is "Director Customer Service Initiatives (I think?), Marketing, Transwestern Pipeline Company". 
 The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, Williams Field Services is not an "owner" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a "hub" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity. 
 I taked with Kathy about WFS.  They are not an owner, but are transporting on NWPL's capacity in the Hub.  Please see the attached revised document where I've added to the explanation of the Hub agreements. 
 Please see the attached PowerPoint presentation.  This is a first draft of certain sections (Industry Environment, Competitive Environment and Revenue Generation) of the TW Ratings Package. 
 Thanks!  I just wanted to know the schedule to see if we needed to leave a key out for ya'll on Thursday or anything.  Sam & I will be home by the time you get to the house.  Friday is my day off, so that works out well.  We're looking forward to seeing you guys! Get ready to be "bossed" by the master =)  Sam's running the show!  Love, Lindy 
 I am planning on taking vacation on the following days:  1/2 day		Monday morning, 1/28 2 days		Thursday & Friday, 1/31 & 2/1 (Sam's school is closed)  Please let me know if there are any conflicts with this schedule.  Thanks, Lindy 
 I'm sorry I won't be in the office tomorrow.  Lindy 
 I was trying to respond to your message about the IOS meeting Friday & I lost it.  I will not be able to be at the meeting.  I am not in the office on Friday.  Please let me know if it will be rescheduled or when we can meet to discuss.  Thanks again, Lindy 
 Teb, I'm sorry I wasn't in this morning.  Can you fill me in on the meeting when you have time? Thanks, Lindy X36007 
 What is the elementary school for the Autumn Lake subdivision?  Thank you, Lindy Donoho 
 Amy & Ahmed, Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart! We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy! I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that! Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing. I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know. We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton. The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =) I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.  Take care! Love, Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids 
 Ken, Did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the Daily Balance report?  I'm thinking (oh-oh) that I might not be able to talk with you after Friday and I wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation &/or let me know who will have the file (Richard Hanagriff)?  Thanks, Lindy 
 How are you?!  It's so good to hear from you.  Of course I get the updates from Lorrainey & I knew about your new job.  I hope everything is going well there.  Lorraine said that you really liked it.  I thought of Florabama when I heard you were hired at Duke.  Lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive (I don't think) in our negotiations with them.  We need to meet you for lunch someday.  It would be great to see Jeff too, if we could get ahold of him.  He called the other day with a building question.  He sounded good and said Lisa had some irons in the fire.  Everything here is...wierd!!  And it's pretty sad.  The NNG commercial people go over (red rover, red rover) to Dynegy starting Friday.  (This would include Mary Kay - talk about a midlife crisis!)  It's all pretty sad (along with Lay resignation, Baxter suicide, etc.)  The new guy started today - who knows?!  How is Craig?  It looks like Calpine is holding their own.  I've left some messages for Diana, but haven't heard back from her.  Sam is wonderful.  He is talking alot and he's very busy!!  My dad and my stepmom, Flo, were here this last weekend for a visit.  Tony and I got to go out to dinner and to a movie - WOW!  Thanks for keeping in touch.  Let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon.  Lindy 
 Can I help you with anything else for the TW presentation? 
 FYI - status of TW presentation. 
 March 9th would  be good for us.  Thanks!  Lindy 
 This Wed or Thurs, could you update the monthly Cal '02 prices for me again?  Permian San Juan SoCalGas  Hopefully, this will be the last time.  I need to give Tracy the final version of an abbreviated presentation (for Ken Lay mtg 11/8) by the end of this week.  I just wanted to refresh the numbers one more time. 
 It's a kids weekend, so we'll see if we can get babysitters. 
 Here is a diagram of the general segment capacities on Transwestern for the past 2006 analysis.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Jan already has TW's average historical rates derived from TW's actuals (contract rates and throughput/MAXDTQ's) totaled up to TW's contract paths for 2000 and 2001.  I am going to use these numbers to allocate the path average rates to the pipeline segments in Davis' template. 
   Here's the file. 
 Michael, I prepared the TW Marketing slides.  I have been incorporating Kim and Steve's comments.  You can work with me on any questions you have or any additional information you may need from Marketing. I follow-up on your notes in red.  Thx, Lindy 
 Here's what Ron worked up. 
 The "Total 2001 Revenue" number for slide 26 is $179,447,244.  The percentages are:  SoCal		30% Texaco		9% PG&E		9% Sempra		8% BP Energy	6% Duke		4% El Paso		4% Burlington	3% Agave		3% USGT		3% Other Shippers	22% ($38,875,051)
