dy to be "bossed" by the master =)  Sam's running the show!  Love, Lindy 
 I am planning on taking vacation on the following days:  1/2 day		Monday morning, 1/28 2 days		Thursday & Friday, 1/31 & 2/1 (Sam's school is closed)  Please let me know if there are any conflicts with this schedule.  Thanks, Lindy 
 I'm sorry I won't be in the office tomorrow.  Lindy 
 I was trying to respond to your message about the IOS meeting Friday & I lost it.  I will not be able to be at the meeting.  I am not in the office on Friday.  Please let me know if it will be rescheduled or when we can meet to discuss.  Thanks again, Lindy 
 Teb, I'm sorry I wasn't in this morning.  Can you fill me in on the meeting when you have time? Thanks, Lindy X36007 
 What is the elementary school for the Autumn Lake subdivision?  Thank you, Lindy Donoho 
 Amy & Ahmed, Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart! We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy! I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that! Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing. I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know. We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton. The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =) I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.  Take care! Love, Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids 
 Ken, Did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the Daily Balance report?  I'm thinking (oh-oh) that I might not be able to talk with you after Friday and I wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation &/or let me know who will have the file (Richard Hanagriff)?  Thanks, Lindy 
 How are you?!  It's so good to hear from you.  Of course I get the updates from Lorrainey & I knew about your new job.  I hope everything is going well there.  Lorraine said that you really liked it.  I thought of Florabama when I heard you were hired at Duke.  Lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive (I don't think) in our negotiations with them.  We need to meet you for lunch someday.  It would be great to see Jeff too, if we could get ahold of him.  He called the other day with a building question.  He sounded good and said Lisa had some irons in the fire.  Everything here is...wierd!!  And it's pretty sad.  The NNG commercial people go over (red rover, red rover) to Dynegy starting Friday.  (This would include Mary Kay - talk about a midlife crisis!)  It's all pretty sad (along with Lay resignation, Baxter suicide, etc.)  The new guy started today - who knows?!  How is Craig?  It looks like Calpine is holding their own.  I've left some messages for Diana, but haven't heard back from her.  Sam is wonderful.  He is talking alot and he's very busy!!  My dad and my stepmom, Flo, were here this last weekend for a visit.  Tony and I got to go out to dinner and to a movie - WOW!  Thanks for keeping in touch.  Let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon.  Lindy 
 Can I help you with anything else for the TW presentation? 
 FYI - status of TW presentation. 
 March 9th would  be good for us.  Thanks!  Lindy 
 This Wed or Thurs, could you update the monthly Cal '02 prices for me again?  Permian San Juan SoCalGas  Hopefully, this will be the last time.  I need to give Tracy the final version of an abbreviated presentation (for Ken Lay mtg 11/8) by the end of this week.  I just wanted to refresh the numbers one more time. 
 It's a kids weekend, so we'll see if we can get babysitters. 
 Here is a diagram of the general segment capacities on Transwestern for the past 2006 analysis.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Jan already has TW's average historical rates derived from TW's actuals (contract rates and throughput/MAXDTQ's) totaled up to TW's contract paths for 2000 and 2001.  I am going to use these numbers to allocate the path average rates to the pipeline segments in Davis' template. 
   Here's the file. 
 Michael, I prepared the TW Marketing slides.  I have been incorporating Kim and Steve's comments.  You can work with me on any questions you have or any additional information you may need from Marketing. I follow-up on your notes in red.  Thx, Lindy 
 Here's what Ron worked up. 
 The "Total 2001 Revenue" number for slide 26 is $179,447,244.  The percentages are:  SoCal		30% Texaco		9% PG&E		9% Sempra		8% BP Energy	6% Duke		4% El Paso		4% Burlington	3% Agave		3% USGT		3% Other Shippers	22% ($38,875,051) 
 The source for "Growing Power Generation Markets" pie slide is the Arizona Corporation Commission (this is Arizona's PUC).
