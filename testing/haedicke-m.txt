 Please handle.  I think you should send an email to the OGC and ask if they are aware of any such contracts.  Mark 
 How would we do this efficiently in EWS?  Mark 
 Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts as described below by Sharon Butcher.  "The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current contracts.  This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.  In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.  We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

 I am responding on behalf of Mark Haedicke.  We have checked with our department and our lawyers are not aware of any such contracts as you described in your e-mail.  Barbara Gray responded, "I am unaware of any subcontracts for this period.  I do know that we have used minority lawyers, but that does not appear to be responsive to the question."  Thank you. 
 Orlando;  I am ok with the your suggestion.  Hope you are doing well.  Mark    Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 04/17/2001 06:18 AM

 Steve and Peter:  From a control point of view, we should have at least one director based in Houston.  Does that present any significant tax risk?  Let us know.  Mark Haedicke 
 no changes.  Mark    Cynthia Richards <CRICHARDS@isda.org> 05/01/2001 09:02 AM

 The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the District Court for discovery and eventually trial. 
 Greetings:  John, I would like to promote Hodge to VP this time around.  I know our system has changed to get that done, but I wanted to get your support on this.  I believe Jeff has done a good job  and added significant value for a long time and has earned it.  Give me your thoughts.  Mark

In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay.  It is likely EES' service contract with USC will expire before any trial at the District Court. 
 Here are my thoughts so far:  1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron Rothwarg  2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week  3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months  4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA  5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval  6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot be hedged 
 FYI 
 I think we will need to do something for Peter.  I would be interested in HRs view on how much.  Mark    David Oxley/ENRON@enronXgate 05/14/2001 02:19 PM 
 The lawyers had a kick-off meeting today.  Vicki and I echoed your point on not shutting down the business.   We have a great team assembled and I think it will calm down the traders in EWS.  I will keep you posted.  Mark Haedicke    David W Delainey@EES 05/11/2001 05:55 PM

 Not clear at this point.  No deals have been done.  My guess is that it will be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark    "Swanstrom, Bill" <BSwanstrom@lockeliddell.com> 05/20/2001 12:04 PM 
 Please review and set up a meeting with me to establish a plan for this committee.  Mark 
 Stacy and Ruth:  I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee:  1.  convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue this 2.  California energy issues/solutions 3.  standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff, netting, termination, etc. 4.  bankruptcy 5.  CFTC study of retail derivatives 6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc.  Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference. Let me know what you think.

 Wow!  Dan please go ahead and make the call and be sure to let them know we are schocked at the amount of the billing!  Mark

 Why don't you sign the opinion.  Let's get together later in the week.  I have some ideas to pitch to you.  Mark    Barbara N Gray 05/29/2001 09:44 AM

 I appreciate the request, but have never given the slides I use out in electronic form.  To do that we would need to have very detailed conversations about how they would be used.  Give me a call if you still want to talk about it.  Mark 
 I want to be involved as we are in the process of signing up employment contracts with Sami Arap, Louise Wantanabe and Vicki Martinez.  John Novak and I need to approve all the changes.  Thanks.  Mark    David Oxley/ENRON@enronXgate 06/01/2001 03:27 PM 
 Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside FERC.  It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential.  We want the data to be as good as possible.  If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations.  Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US.    Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 06/01/2001 02:56 PM
