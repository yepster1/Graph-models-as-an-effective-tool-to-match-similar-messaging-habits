ateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems.  2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy  --  in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.  The traders and originators helped design the policy and have "bought in".  Training was completed in June.  This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.  3.  Lead power industry to develop a standardized form  --  pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.  The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form.  The result will be a significant saving of legal time and effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk of an unintended default.  4.  Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses. These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii) acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and the Peoples deals.  5.  Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.  6.  Deals are Us  --  lots and lots of deals done.  Legal built a closer relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the company.

 Great conference in Amsterdam.  It was the best one yet.  I would like to have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next year.  I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.   If we do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our membership dramatically.  Let me know what you think.  Regards,  Mark 
 If you have not already done so, please complete and turn in 1999 Year End Performance Reviews for all employees that report to you (lawyers, legal specialists and administrative staff).  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 I will need the 1999 Year End Performance Reviews completed by Friday, April 7.  Thank you. 
 Yes, I want to continue receiving it.  Mark 
 Have you thought about Arthur Andersen or PriceWaterhouse?    Mark 
 yes. 
 Please get the lunch on my schedule and book me to take them on a tour of the trading floor.  Mark 
 Thanks for the info.  Mark 
 Bill:  I am looking foward to the game!  I will try to walk over to your offices by 6:00.  Mark 
 Thanks for the update.   Mark 
 Charles, the article looks very good to me.  I could not open the exhibits. Mark 
 Rick, please send me the schedule so I can foward it on to our lead trader in Japan.  Thanks.  Mark 
 That sounds like a great start in France.  Mark 
 Thanks.  We are in litigation with the Px.  Let me know if she continues to pursue Enron.  Mark 
 Thanks for the info.   Mark 
 Best of luck!  Please keep in touch!    Mark 
 I am on the boards on Harris County Children's Protective Services and International Swaps and Derivatives Association.  Mark 
 Liz, I would love to go.  Can I let you know tomorrow as I am still not sure what time by obligations here are over?    Mark 
 I don't know the person mentioned.   Mark 
 I will have to take a rain check.  I am meeting my son's fourth grade field trip here in SA and as it turns out we won't head back until about 7 pm. Have a great tme.    Mark 
 I think that is as good as we can get under the circumstances.  I would take it.  Mark 
 Jim:  Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo:  Global Trading --  All lawyers providing legal services for trading activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one group reporting to Mark Haedicke.  Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books".  To that end, Mark will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company. The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks day to day.  It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report will be prepared for Enron. 
 H&K has done only a little work for us.  Mark 
 For your review -- the latest diagram for the paper website.  Michael, I am free to discuss this at your convenience.  I am hopeful this structure will be unregulated in Europe as well.  Mark 
 Not enough experience.  Mark 
 I did it last week!  I  think it is a great seminar.  Mark 
 Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:  1.   our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends 2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost to customers 3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products 4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offerings  Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.  Mark Haedicke 
 George, I think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at hand.  I think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have proposed.  I would ask Robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your points and then let's all briefly review it.  I want to stay mindful that litigation is possible and we have to chose our words carefully in event of litigation.  Mark 
 That is a great success.     Mark 
 Bill, I am thinking I could do it May 14 or May 21, if that works for others.  I will confirm next week if those dates work.  Mark 
 Susan:  It is ok to provide the requested information.  Mark 
 Thanks for the invitation, but I cannot make it on Friday.  Have a great time.  Mark 
 Please list Mark Haedicke as an attendee for the Thursday, August 19, 1999 Bon Voyage Bash for Kevin and Christine Hannon  Thank You 
 Yes, the 21st works for me.  I already made the mistake of mentioning the 14th to Susan and she reminded me what day it was.  Mark 
 Bill, I am flexible but I like between 7 and 8.  Mark 
 Ken, how should I help promote the Senate bill?  Does it allow us to do a many to many paper product financial exchange without regulation?  What would you change about the Senate bill?  Mark 
 Dave, I didn't see Julia's name on the list.  I assume it was just oversight.  Let me know.  Mark 
 FYI 
 Yes, talk to Cynthia or Mark Taylor.  Mark 
 Thanks, I think your list has real potential from a patent point of view. Mark 
 Thanks, the talking points are helpful.  Mark 
 A couple of other thoughts:  1.  Aggressively pursue litigation claims and manage litigation risks. 2.  Build contracts and legal infrastructure to support new businesses like paper. 3.  Develop top talent in the firms to assist getting all our deals done.  Mark 
 I will be there.  Mark 
 Yes.  Also, outside legal usually increases over the last 4 months of the year.  Mark 
 I could not open the document.  Mark 
 Rob, she could talk to Barbara Gray about a position as a paralegal.  Barbara is looking for help on some of the asset work.  Mark 
 Not enough experience for our shop. 
 Louise, I can take care of this.  Once in a while, I need to get my hands dirty.  Mark 
 Jason:  I have reviewed the CA and only have one comment.  I would like to add a paragragh 10 as follows:  "This Agreement shall terminate on the date one year from the date of this Agreement."  Enron Net Works LLC will be the party to the agreement.  The address is 1400 Smith Street, Houston Texas  77002.  Please set up the agreement for signature by Louise Kitchen as Managing Director.  My number is 713-853-6544 if you have any questions.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about energy.  I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like financial commodity swaps.  Also, I pointed out that innovation has been slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure. I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill.  Mark 
 Rick Grove and I spoke with Chairman Rainer on Friday about energy and he did not budge.  He appears to be strongly against us.  Why do you think that is? 
 Pls. handle.  Mark 
 Peter, the summary is very helpful.  Perhaps, we should drop the summary into the monthly report?  Please talk to Julia about that.  I want to make it as efficient as possible.  Mark 
 Nora, thanks for the information.  As new issues come up, please copy Mark Taylor.  Thanks for your help.  Mark 
 Justin, thanks!   Mark 
 Liz, it looks fine.  I have printed it and will initial for Greg's signature.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Once you get the original back, please send to me for my files.  Mark
