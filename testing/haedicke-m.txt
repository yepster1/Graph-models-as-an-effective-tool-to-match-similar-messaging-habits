lawyers in ENA Legal.  In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become standard at ENA.  1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial professional services.  2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by $25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional professional services.  3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should be obtained for each transaction.  Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544. 
 Mary:  That is good news.  At the rate we are going, we will have enough energy companies before long to have substantial commodity committee meeting in North America.  I am still thinking about the breakfast in New York.  Take care.  Mark

 I want to get this started.  Let's get together at the time provided below. Mark 
 Do you know what this is about?   Mark 
 Mary: This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.  The companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application. Let me know if you need other info.   Mark    Mary Cunningham <MCUNNINGHAM@isda.org> 10/16/2000 09:59 AM 
 It's ok to use Blakes given the conflicts.  On the structure, I will forward this message to Steven Douglas and ask for his advice.  Mark    Peter Keohane 10/16/2000 01:01 PM

 I am fine with your recommendations except I see no need to have an outside director if not legally required.  Who would you recommend as filling that director position?  Mark    Peter Keohane Sent by: Nella Cappelletto 04/12/2000 12:03 PM

 It is ok.  Mark    "JOHN G KLAUBERG" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 10/17/2000 06:50 PM 
 Dave:  Based on our discussions this morning:  1.  Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares.  The time allocation matrix will be revised  during the year if material changes in the work occur.  2.  Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.  Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated.  A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all employees.  3.  Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel.  [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.] Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.  4.  Reopener!  -- need to review where business changes significantly.    David W Delainey 10/19/2000 12:33 PM 
 Dave:  I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?  Mark 
 Attached is our organizational chart which will be prettied up over time. 
 Sorry, here's the attachment. 
 I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:  1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts. 2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.  Please give me your comments.  Mark 
 Keep me posted on this matter.  Mark 
 Terry, thanks for your reply.  As our thinking starts to mature, I would like to talk to you about what we see in the Japanese markets re energy.  Perhaps, we can talk in New York in November at the ISDA board meeting.  Take care. Mark

 The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the following:  review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources, inside and outside performance metrics  In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.

 Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?  The markets will be integrated, at least in part, into the US.  We could have an annex for Ontario.  We will be using the EEI form right across the border in the US.  Let 's chat about this. Regards, Mark    Peter Keohane 10/25/2000 08:58 AM

 Bruce:  I think your suggestion makes sense.  An e-mail or voicemail on major developments as they occur would be helpful.  Thanks,   Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/13/2000 06:01 AM 
 ok 
 Jim:  I am confused.  LeBeouf wanted to represent ENA and EES and Reliant never came up in the conversations.  We picked Brobeck and it was painful for LeBoeuf.  I think there must be some additional facts relative to New Power.  Regards,  Mark    James Derrick@ENRON 12/15/2000 06:01 PM 
 Great job!    Mark    Chris Long@ENRON 12/16/2000 10:16 AM 
 Please schedule.  Mark 
 please schedule 
 Thanks for the update.  Keep spending time getting advice from Barbara.  Mark 
 I am confirming.  Mark 
 Please review the attached hypos and give me comments.  How do I make 2 and 3 better?  What other hypos should I add?  Maybe one geared more toward Alberta?  Mark 
 Peter:  I have attached my work in progress to give you an idea of what I am looking for.  Regards,  Mark 
 As a follow up to our meeting with the traders last week about litigation risks,  I have drafted the attached hypos (so far) for discussion about legal risks in the changing landscape.  Let me know if you have any comments. 
 My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following:  1.    EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry development of the first master power contract.  The form is rapidly becoming the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically lowering costs and increasing liquidity.  In October, we put an EEI into place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 less than under the prior contract.  2.    New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal risks.  3.    EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training regarding all major EWS legal issues.  This website will reduce training costs and increase availability of training to all employees.  4.    Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com, insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia.  5.     Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA.  6.    Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas Cogen II, Pastoria, sale of the Peakers, sale of HPL, Electrobolt, JV with Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power, QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets) and on and on.  7.    Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business.  8.    Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across Enron. 
 Thanks so much for your help on the BEARing gifts program!  It is a great cause and your help will make Christmas a lot happier for a lot of kids who really have very difficult lives.  Most have never received anything new. Have a great holiday season!  Mark Haedicke 
 Thanks.  Have a great Christmas!   Mark    Angela Davis@ENRON 12/20/2000 10:53 AM 
 David:  My first choice would be Dec 29 and second, Jan 3.  Let me know, I will need to schedule the time.  Regards,  Mark    David Love-Dallas <DLove@russellreynolds.com> 12/20/2000 09:59 AM 
 I would try talking to Jenny Rub. She can refer you to the right person. Mark    Gail Brownfeld@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/20/2000 08:19 AM 
 Yes, through Thursday.  Mark    Richard Lydecker@ENRON 12/19/2000 03:38 PM

 Mark:  Should we get Cheryl Nelson to start getting up to speed on some of= =20 the transportation and shipping issues?  Let me know.  Mark Haedicke 
 Please make the changes marked by Sager.   Mark 
 I will plan on 10:00 am to noon in your Houston offices on Dec 29 unless I hear otherwise from you.  Thanks, Mark    David Love-Dallas <DLove@russellreynolds.com> 12/20/2000 03:31 PM

 I don't know what subscription she is talking about.  Please handle.  Mark 
 I am trying to change my schedule, but so far I have a conflict for the dinner in London.   Mark    Cynthia Richards <CRICHARDS@isda.org> 12/28/2000 11:40 AM 
 Please talk to Frank and let me know how we should approach Coralina.  Have a happy new year!   Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/29/2000 12:00 PM 
 Please review and give me your comments on the attached proposal re adopting a standard from 1 to 10 on legal risk ratings.  I am most concerned that the proposal works for our international transactions.  Let me know.  I would like to roll this out sometime in January.  Regards,  Mark 
 Rob, I am still waiting for the first run of the numbers for legal.  I will keep you posted.  Mark    Rob Milnthorp 01/03/2001 10:40 AM

 On the commodity side of our business, there is a long list of lawsuits on commodity prices in CA.  This may be a committee discussion item.  Mark    Richard Grove <RGROVE@isda.org> 01/02/2001 03:39 PM 
 fyi 
 I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC") and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.  The OGC and the LC would have the following members:  OGC     LC Alan Aronowitz     OGC Mark Evans     Justin Boyd Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane Travis McCullough    John Novak Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?] Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers Richard Sanders    Paul Simons Lance Schuler Mark Taylor Sheila Tweed Randy Young  Please give me your comments.  It is anticipated that we will continue to adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.  I plan to address the policy committee in February. 
 The intent is that the higher the rating, the higher the legal risk.  I believe the jurisdictional risk is a key factor in creating legal issues even if none exist at the time the deal is done.  Does that make sense?  Stuart should be on the LC.  Randy is the GC of South America.  Mark    Lance Schuler-Legal 01/04/2001 04:50 PM 
 Thanks for your comments.  I think it would be a good idea to have Jon on as well.  I will add Jon and Marcus to the list.  Please let them know as appropriate.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke    Mark Evans 01/04/2001 01:45 PM 
 Please review and give your thoughts to me and Randy.   Mark 
 Why should we hold them harmless on environmental if they get their money out?  We would only want to provide an ENA indemnity if necessary.  I have asked Lisa to look at this.  Mark    Randal Maffett 01/04/2001 01:13 PM 
 I think the cut is going to be that a person runs a group.  Mark    Alan Aronowitz 01/04/2001 12:18 PM 
 I agree with your reasoning.  Mark    Christian Yoder 01/04/2001 03:37 PM

 Chris:  I would like to be kept up to date on who the potential candidates are.  We are planning on inviting Newsome to speak at our ISDA conference in March.  Thanks,  Mark    Chris Long@ENRON 01/08/2001 09:14 AM

 What would you propose?  I am open to whatever makes sense.  Should we ask him to move to Sao Paulo?     Mark    Randy Young@ENRON 01/09/2001 06:07 AM 
 Why wouldn't Dan see Johan's number?   Mark    Angela Ernest@EES 01/08/2001 08:44 AM

 fyi 
 I would like to sit in from 230 to 300.  Thanks.  Mark

 I never heard of the company.  Mark    Mary Cunningham <MCUNNINGHAM@isda.org> 01/10/2001 04:43 PM 
 In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:  1.     Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and indirectly MSEB without any credit support?  The only security is the equity in DPC?  Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep pockets?  How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?  2.     Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local courts with respect to the LNG contracts?  Fraud?  Bribery?  Are there any local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the contracts?  Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?  3.     What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?  Only where the PPA is terminated?  Payments?  4.    Who negotiated the contracts?  Were there requests for credit support? From Enron?  Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by its investment in Dabhol?  5.   What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational capability" language in the contracts?  What was the language meant to cover?  Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?  6.   Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts? Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?

Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?  7.    What is the law on piercing the corporate veil for an Indian company like DPC?  Could this issue be considered separate from the contract and be litigated in India or Oman and thus outside the arbitration?  8.     What is the list of all documents that could impact on whether or not Enron has any exposure under the LNG contracts?  9.     Are there instances where the Dabhol project could fail and the LNG contracts would not novate to MSEB?  Why does it matter if the LNG contract obligations novate to MSEB if DPC has no money?  10.   Other potential claims against Enron if the LNG contracts are terminated or not performed? 
 Please give Christian a call on this and make sure you are satisfied we not taking too great a risk.  Mark 
 Please find attached my draft summary relative to the above contracts.  Let me know if you have any corrections.  Mark Haedicke 
 I was convinced otherwise by Randy.    Janette Elbertson 01/16/2001 10:36 AM

 Please coordinate with Jane on this.  Mark 
 This is about a trip to Brazil.  She asked me to pay the $6000 in expenses. Do you see any rationale to pay for this?  Mark

 Great job!  Thanks.  Mark    Mary Clark@ENRON 01/29/2001 02:46 PM 
 Dad:  The name I have is Dr. Vinberg.  He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 80s.  I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good.  He recommended that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if it is productive.  His number is 713-622-1441.  He charges $150 per hour and I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston. Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you.  If he is, I will propose dates and we can see if they work for everyone.  Love,  Mark 
 I have asked Dan Lyons to give you a call on this.  Mark    Greg Johnston 01/29/2001 05:36 PM 
 Dan:  I think you should add a sentence that you will continue to be directly involved in LNG matters including the contracts for Dabhol and that addtional resources are being developed in London both inside and outside.  Mark    Daniel R Rogers@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/30/2001 04:23 PM

 Frank:  I am not in favor of this promotion.  I think in the new environment that it could be negative for him.  Let's talk about it.  Mark    Frank Sayre@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/05/2001 09:36 AM 
 I would suggest Dan Lyons from ENA Legal for Vision and Values.  Mark

I spoke with your assistant this morning and this meeting has been rescheduled for Thursday, March 1, at 11:30 am in Jim Derrick's office.  Lunch is scheduled after the meeting if that meets your schedule.  Mark Haedicke is traveling this week.  I will call your e-mail to his attention upon his return on Friday.

 I think it must be in Moran's area.   Mark 
 Mina:  Mark Haedicke does not have his lap top computer with him so he probably has not seen this e-mail.  Janette Elbertson     Mina Miyakawa@ENRON 02/13/2001 03:40 PM 
 Does it still make sense to have these meetings anymore?  Maybe just sit in on Novak's meeting.   Mark Haedicke 
 Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.  It seems like overkill to recruit just for shipping.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke    Mark Evans 02/14/2001 05:28 PM 
 I am not sure why that is.  Non-trading work is off a little so maybe that is it.  Be sure to touch base with Lance Schuler about the work he sees coming up.   I am happy to talk about it.  Mark    "Swanstrom, Bill" <BSwanstrom@lockeliddell.com> 02/15/2001 10:45 PM

 Below are Mark Haedicke's revisions to the announcement.   The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new We are pleased to announce organizational changes that have been implemented in to the Enron South America legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets.  Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new responsibilities within Enron.  Replacing him will be John Novak, who will become General Counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new structure is attached.  We believe This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal support across business lines within South America while improving coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development initiatives under way in the region.        John Novak@ENRON 02/16/2001 02:02 PM

 fyi 
 Wow!  Things can change quickly.  Thanks.  Mark    Rob Walls@ENRON 02/20/2001 04:46 PM 
 I am available as a last resort.  I have asked Alan Aronowitz who is the GC of Enron Global Markets to make a presentation.  I will let you know.   Mark    "Liz O'Sullivan" <LOSULLIVAN@isda.org> 02/20/2001 11:36 AM

 Let's send it out today.  Mark 
 Rob:  How can we get some relief on this issue?  Should we set up a call with Peter and me?  There really is an earnings impact.   Let me know.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 It's ok with me.  Mark    "JOHN G KLAUBERG" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 02/19/2001 01:35 PM 
 Congrats!  Things seem to be building rapidly now on the Continent.  Mark 
 You would need to start out in the associate program.  Good luck.  Mark 
 No need to do a risk memo if the legal risk rating would be a 1.  Is that what this one would be?  Mark 
 The report is well done.  For my purposes it could be much shorter -- really in a bullet list format.  Thanks.  Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/15/2001 03:34 PM 
 John:  What is the status on this?  I now have Eddie Daniels dedicated full time to Cuiba.  Hopefully that will help you some.  Regards,  Mark 
 Rex:  We are trying to make this as limited as possible.  Can you define specifically what requires an exception?  I am the signoff for the wholesale group, but it makes sense to be consistent across Enron.  Regards,  Mark    Sharon Morgan/ENRON@enronXgate 02/13/2001 11:11 AM

 My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or interest rate traders.  Mark 
 Ruth: The press release looks fine.  Mark    Ruth Ainslie <RAinslie@isda.org> 02/28/2001 10:57 AM

 Please update the attached Legal Risk Report.   Send the revised report by e-mail.  Thank you. 
 I am willing to do this on the 20th, but only for one hour maximum.  See if Jim has any interest and then get back to Peter.   Mark 
 please set up.  Mark 
 Chris:  Thanks for the message.  I appreciate the feedback.  I know she has been working particularly hard lately!  We are working to add resources, but that is not easy.  Thanks for your support.  Mark    Christopher F Calger 03/04/2001 12:15 PM

 Your comments 
 Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " future California", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put in place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on "inability to pay debts as they become due".  Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements. 
 Louise:  Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk about what are the objectives.  Great question!  Mark    Louise Kitchen 03/28/2001 04:27 PM 
 I will call Mark Golden to respond in a few days.  I don't think this is entirely negative for us.  We can use it to get the products we want.  Mark

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.  Thank you.

 This is way too much of a commercial!  Two thirds of it speaks only to Kiodex.  Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.

 Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts as described below by Sharon Butcher.  "The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current contracts.  This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.  In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.  We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

 The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the District Court for discovery and eventually trial. 
 Greetings:  John, I would like to promote Hodge to VP this time around.  I know our system has changed to get that done, but I wanted to get your support on this.  I believe Jeff has done a good job  and added significant value for a long time and has earned it.  Give me your thoughts.  Mark

 Here are my thoughts so far:  1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron Rothwarg  2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week  3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months  4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA  5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval  6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot be hedged

It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential.  We want the data to be as good as possible.  If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations.  Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US.    Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 06/01/2001 02:56 PM 
 Glad to have you as an employee of Enron!   Mark    Steve C Hall/ENRON@enronXgate 06/01/2001 01:38 PM

 Delayed.  I prepared an outline but have made no progress beyond that. Nothing will be available this summer.  Regards,  Mark    "Mogel, William" <WMogel@ssd.com> 06/06/2001 10:45 AM 
 Looks ok to me.  Mark    Elizabeth Sager 06/06/2001 10:17 AM 
 We need to address both issues unless there is some compelling reason not to.  Mark    Andrew Edison@ENRON 06/06/2001 09:19 AM

 Put this as tentative on my schedule.  Mark 
 Great!  John L said he was going to leave legal to us.  So please take the lead in proposing changes for the legal team and propose the changes to me so we can get it done.  Regards,  Mark    John Novak@ENRON 06/06/2001 01:25 PM 
 I loved it!   Mark    Michelle Cash 06/08/2001 09:05 AM 
 I am willing to wear the risk.  Remember, my $100.  Mark    Andrew Edison@ENRON 06/07/2001 04:30 PM
