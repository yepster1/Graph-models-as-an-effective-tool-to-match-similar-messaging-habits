 Please handle re Paul Nelson. 
 Please schedule. 
 We have purchased 30 copies of the referenced book.  It is a short read -- about 30-45 minutes.  The copies are located at the clerks' station, EB3808. Please read this short story prior to our ENA Legal Conference and then return it to the clerks' station so everyone attending the conference will have an opportunity to read it prior to the conference. 
 I am working on the scheduling the meeting this afternoon with Power Systems and their outside lawyers to ask for the legal opinion we need on this matter.  We have to nail down all the facts and then get Power System's outside lawyers to write the appropriate opinion.  I will keep you posted.  Mark 
 Please send an e-mail copy of the speech I gave shortly after meeting with Mr. Ford.   Mark 
 George:  I will send it by e-mail.  Take care.   Mark 
 Please call John Arnold and ask him where the traders are coming out on this.  Let me know.  Mark 
 Jim, I am looking for weather data by region for 98 and 99.  I believe that there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support that.  This is background info to support the arguments for standardized power contracts,  which are nearly agreed to.  Let me know what there is and who I should talk to.  Thanks for your help.     Mark 
 I think it is both Rappaport and his target audience.  I think Dan needs to hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re electronic trading.  Silence by us could be misinterpreted by him.  Let me know what you think.  Mark    Louise Kitchen 09/25/2000 11:12 AM 
 Dan, please prepare a list of items you think I should sign off on and then set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team.     Mark 
 Steve:  It looks like a great program!  I am happy to participate.  I would like to have a teleconference of the panel within a few weeks so that I can make sure I have time to get my materials together.  Regards,  Mark    SKramer@milbank.com 09/20/2000 04:14 PM 
 For your files.  Mark 
 I got the chart in electronic form.  Mark 
 John:  Let me know if you are ok with the following memo which would come from you and me to  the traders and senior originators:    Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than one month will be destroyed on that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders.   We are still looking at moving to recording only the deal terms -- but that is a long term project.  Mark 
 Dan, I would like to have a brief meeting with the team to talk through the list -- to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.  Let's do it soon with the idea we would have another meeting to wrap things up as appropriate.  Mark    Dan Lyons 09/25/2000 03:23 PM 
 Let me know if you see any problem.  Mark 
 Can you look into this and get back to me.  Thanks.  Mark 
 Steve:  It's ok to put confirmed.  Mark 
 Please briefly review the slides attached below and give me your reaction. Please forward on to our clients if you think it would be helpful.   Mark

 Paul:  It is true that there is no wall -- however, it is geographically separate. The equity trading is the end portion of the floor.  There are three hallways that go to equity trading, each about 10 feet long.  It would not be possible to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area.  Robert Bruce is working on updating our policy and procedures in Houston and by copy hereof ask him to update you.    Paul Simons 09/19/2000 01:53 PM 
 Please confirm we send this memo to MDs and key commercial employes.    Mark 
 Everyone was intrigued that Enron submitted a proposal.  However, it is difficult to guess the outcome.  Mark 
 Rick:  I would like to have a presentation on local rules such as ISO rules in the various locations where we operate.  Can your group do this as we work on the legal presentations.  I believe this is already happening in part, but I would like to make more institutionalized.  Let me know.   Mark    Richard Shapiro@EES 09/08/2000 09:42 AM 
 Please work with Richard Sanders to decide on the distribution list which should include all MDs and Robert Knight.  I want to get it out by Wednesday.  Mark

 Alan, please handle and respond directly to Rick.  It looks like it would be a good opportunity for ECT to speak.  Mark 
 The schedule looks good.  I don't think there is any need for me to meet with Stikeman.  Thanks.  Mark 
 The lunch for October will be at Dong Ting, 611 Stuart at Smith, from Noon to 1:00 PM.  The telephone number is 713-527-0005.  Please RSVP to my assistant, Janette Elbertson, at extension 37906 to let her know if you will be attending.  Thanks.

 Please delete the referenced meetings from your calendars.  It is no longer necessary to have this meeting on Thursdays, from 11:00 to 11:30 AM.  Thank you. 
 Should the first order of business be to decide who is responsible for each form and then review who must approve the changes?  Maybe we should do that ahead of time?  Also, should we set a time schedule?  Mark 
 Hi Larry:  I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.  I think we got a gift -- I remember Susan saying something.  I am just the Dad!  Everything is going well.

 Only the 3 slides on power point.  Mark 
 Does Rob want to meet on Oct 5?  If yes, I want to be done by 10:00.   Mark 
 Yes for the choice of law but not for jurisdiction.  We could agree to non-exclusive jurisdiction in Ohio.  Mark    James Grace@ENRON 10/03/2000 01:22 AM 
 It is ok with me.  Mark 
 The attached legal report summarizes current significant legal activities of ENA Legal as of September 15, 2000.  This report does not attempt to list all transactions or include reference to on-going maintenance of completed transactions.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 I am ok with the seminar.  People may have figured out other ways like self study to get their ethics hours in.  Mark 
 FYI 
 No problem.

 Dave:  This is for routine and "small" matters only.  The resolutions are drafted so that the signature authority is narrow and specific.   Frequency is only one factor.   An example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and certain defined confirms.  I will review the authority that has been delegated currently.  [Julia and Deb, please pull the existing resolutions with delegation of authority and let's review.]    David W Delainey 10/09/2000 01:37 PM 
 Bonnie:  Thanks for your note.  I would be happy to meet with you and review opportunities.  Give my assistant a call.  Mark    Bonnie Nelson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/09/2000 12:55 PM 
 You are meeting with Bowen who has authority to hire.  Give me a call and we can talk through each of the people.  Take care.  Mark    LDLIPMAN@aol.com 10/12/2000 08:53 AM 
 Primary.  I think we should give an ultimatum to Cargill.  I could say that all Enron trading is to hedge risk too!  Mark 
 Please schedule this call.  Mark 
 Please give Michelle Cash a call or Karen Jones in Portland.     Mark    Eric Thode@ENRON 10/11/2000 02:44 PM

 Terry:  Greetings.  I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in Japan starting next year.  I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?  Would you or someone else you know want to talk about that?  Let me know.  Hope things are going well.  Take care.  Mark 
 In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become standard at ENA.  1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial professional services.  2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by $25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional professional services.  3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should be obtained for each transaction.  Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544. 
 Please update me on the issues.  Mark 
 Please schedule something either in my office or a lunch.  Whatever they prefer.  Mark 
 Mark Haedicke is available for the conference call on Thursday, October 19, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern time.  Please confirm what time you were able to convene the call.  Thank you. 
 This is a reminder that I need to approve all expense reports for all members of the OGC. 
 Effective immediately, any out of town travel not directly related to a work project needs to be approved in advance by me. 
 In Julia's absence from the office, I need you to prepare an Enron Industrial Monthly Legal Report for October and submit it to me as soon as possible.

 Mary:  That is good news.  At the rate we are going, we will have enough energy companies before long to have substantial commodity committee meeting in North America.  I am still thinking about the breakfast in New York.  Take care.  Mark

 I want to get this started.  Let's get together at the time provided below. Mark 
 Do you know what this is about?   Mark 
 Mary: This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.  The companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application. Let me know if you need other info.   Mark    Mary Cunningham <MCUNNINGHAM@isda.org> 10/16/2000 09:59 AM 
 It's ok to use Blakes given the conflicts.  On the structure, I will forward this message to Steven Douglas and ask for his advice.  Mark    Peter Keohane 10/16/2000 01:01 PM 
 Here are a few.  Take care.   Mark 
 I am fine with your recommendations except I see no need to have an outside director if not legally required.  Who would you recommend as filling that director position?  Mark    Peter Keohane Sent by: Nella Cappelletto 04/12/2000 12:03 PM 
 Rebecca:  This is the response I got back from my contact at IBJ.  Let me know if you would like to meet Terry.  Mark

 Paul:  The ISDA meeting is tentatively set for Jan 18.  So it may be possible for me to be there on the 21st.  As always, the schedule could change, but I would make every effort to be there.  Again, congratulations!  Mark    Paul Simons 10/18/2000 12:49 PM 
 It is ok.  Mark    "JOHN G KLAUBERG" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 10/17/2000 06:50 PM 
 Dave:  Based on our discussions this morning:  1.  Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares.  The time allocation matrix will be revised  during the year if material changes in the work occur.  2.  Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.  Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated.  A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all employees.  3.  Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel.  [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.] Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.  4.  Reopener!  -- need to review where business changes significantly.    David W Delainey 10/19/2000 12:33 PM 
 Dave:  I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?  Mark 
 Attached is our organizational chart which will be prettied up over time. 
 Sorry, here's the attachment. 
 I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:  1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts. 2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.  Please give me your comments.  Mark 
 Keep me posted on this matter.  Mark 
 Terry, thanks for your reply.  As our thinking starts to mature, I would like to talk to you about what we see in the Japanese markets re energy.  Perhaps, we can talk in New York in November at the ISDA board meeting.  Take care. Mark 
 Bruce:  I am tied up for lunch, but let's get together during the day on Monday or Tuesday.   Mark    Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/20/2000 09:25 AM

 I am ok with it so long as you don't spend much time at it.  If there is a material time commitment or the company is competing head to head with Enron, then it would be a problem.  Mark    Randal Maffett 10/16/2000 02:10 PM

 The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the following:  review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources, inside and o
