 Tim looks good to John and I.  Thanks for you help.  ds 
 This is all we know for now.  ds 
 Do you want to be on the call, if so can we use your office.  ds 
 The pressure regulator has been taken out of service at the TW Griffith I/C on the mainline. This is to hopefully minimize the pressure swings to the plant. David if you have any other comments please respond with your ideas.  Thanks DS 
 I'm sorry I have a previous meeting scheduled.  DS 
 Dannis Bellard is transitioning into the MOPS system and he needs to be there.  I will be there if you need me to.  DS 
 The measurement tech should be back this week and looking at that point.  They control the flow. Will let you know asap. as I find something out.  DS 
 Thursday will work best for me.  ds 
 can do.  DS 
 Can we use a summation meter for the POI 500168 Westar Ward County Meter # 9089 and Meter # 10187 We can make this a bi-directional point in our system.  This will make it transparent to our customers.  Thanks DS 
 Contact the plant and see if they will come up to the scheduled burns for the hours.  DS 
 I will not be able to attend NNG is having their customer meeting in KC.  Steve J. or Gary S. will not be here to handle NNG.  Therefore I have to be here for both pipes.  Thanks DS 
  fyi  ds 
 How does 9:00 work for everyone.  This is a very critical topic and needs to be discussed asap.  DS 
 I would be glad to play.  However I am not a scratch golfer anymore.  My ha= ndicap is at 15 now that I don't play as much. If you still want me to play let me know.  Thanks for the invite. =20  DS 
 POI 500168 has been changed in CAS to 200,000 both receipt and delivery.  DS 
 Looks good to me.  We need to get with Jan to see what TW fuel is valued so if we go sell it we don't take a hit on price.  DS 
 Rich,  You did mean September 4th instead of October I hope.  I know your doing this to see if anyone really reads your e:mails.  DS 
 I just figured this was a new way to test us.  DS 
 DL-ETS Gas Controllers@enron.com  TEST  ds 
 Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  DS 
 Projected flows  DS 
 You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.  DS 
 Projected flows for Griffith.  Ds 
 Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes.   DS 
 Please see the attached 
 Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers. If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance, let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.

 This is TW pressure at the inlet of the Griffith I/C. 
 This is interesting news.  Thought you might want to know. I sent him pressures on TW side for the month of may per his request.  ds

 We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections. Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady. Ken, Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant went down. If you have any more questions please call.  Thanks DS  713-853-4299 
 Citizens Griffith Az. I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF)  The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline has been reset at 800#. The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#. Reason:  This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.  This is for our protection.  You may need to raise the setpoint. For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible.  If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.  Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ)  We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.  Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer to the call out list for Citizens.  If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me. The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11. There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.  Let me know what you think of setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control. Reason:  TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith has orders from both pipelines.  Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up some guidelines for us to follow.  Thanks DS 
 FYI  DS 
 FYI We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.  DS 
 Lindy, You are correct they are physical plant receipt points. The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.  Thanks DS 
 Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls.  DS 
 fyi  ds 
 i will be there  ds 
 What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me some ideas.  Thanks Ds 
 Ken,  We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.  DS 
 I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.  Dave can you do this for us. This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.  DS 
  Check with the plant.  ds 
 I will be on vacation.  DS 
 We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.  Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.  DS 
 How long will the unit be down 4 hrs,  8hrs, 12hrs, or all day or longer.  DS 
 Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral. We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances. Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers. If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.  Example:  Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000 ID/1                                                                875,000 ID/2
