 
 I don't know that for a fact.  I assumed since they do the same thing for the lamar power plant they should know to do the same for Griffith and Calpine, that is why we send those daily schedules.  DS 
 I will be in a meeting with BP Amoco from 12 to 2.  Can we do this at 2 pm.  Thanks DS 
 I will be attending.  DS 
 That will be fine.  DS 
  Check with Griffith this morning.  DS 
 I will do that.  Thanks DS 
 This is fyi.  We need to be more careful on this point and refer to the schedule they send us.  Please if you have any questions call.  DS 
 I will be attending.  DS 
 Gas controllers on duty were Gayle Henley and Bart Mondon.  They both did a great job.  Thanks DS

  This is the tournament that I've been asked to play in.  I will be out of t= he office.  DS 
 I will be there.  DS 
 Please read all the below comments. You may get the call.  If you need all the units to run tell them to run all the units.  Let me know by voice mail or e:mail if this happens.  Thanks DS 
 Just in case you receive a call from either JB or David.  They were called yesterday and I spoke with Neal and let them know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and Monday. They were short for Wednesday's gas day.  My conversation was with Neal that they make adjustments to their nominated volumes or turn on more gas.  It does not appear they did either one.  I will call them this morning and let them know that they have until ID-1 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or TW will be cutting their market for ID-1.  Maybe this is a good opportunity to discuss park and ride again.  TW covered 7,000 mmbtu/d of Markets according to the scada numbers that we see.  Let me know if you agree.  Thanks Ds 
  This will be for approximately 8 hrs.  ds 
  Jeff will be calling you before they do anything.  ds 
 Mike can you and Danny get with either Gary or myself to get access to change capacities for the MOPS system in NNG Contract Management System. (CAS)  We will show you where and how to do that. You will also need to post outages to the NNG Web Site.   Thanks DS 
 FYI  ds 
 Right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be.  If we don't have the volumes we can't do it. The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.  Thanks DS

 I'm afraid its true its true.  Thanks for the laugh!  on a more serious note fyi these meters are supposed to be tested every 5 yrs. and they have never been tested or cleaned.  That scares me a bit.  Things just might not go back to- gether like it came aprart, but we shall seeeeeeeeee.....  DS 
 I certainly agree.  This should be fine.  Let me know.  DS 
 no.  Let me try and catch up with Rich.'  DS

 This is what Ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss. 
 I did not send one first thing this morning, however I did give the map to Michelle in the morning.  I told her I did not fax one down this morning.  Sorry Steve didn't get his copy seems I can't win either way.  He will get one from someone.  DS 
 I do thank you for everything you do for the Logistics team.  We will get you what you need in a more timely manner. Today I was running at a fast pace with TW, NNG, systems. Again thank you.  DS
