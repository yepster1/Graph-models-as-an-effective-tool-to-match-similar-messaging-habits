 oh, you don't know the half of it.   Look for baby #5 from the baby machine= to be conceived by next x-mas. Oh, yeah!  She has repeatedly dropped hints= that she would like to have another one.  Mark it down. 
 You are the sexiest woman alive!

 I'm glad you had a good time. No mention of Pappasito's though.  Kemah is always fun, watching the boats, drinking a longneck.  We all walked in the Enron MS walk last weekend. It was fun but I had to carry Ben half of the way which gave be a better workout than I anticipated.  Had a date with Deanne Sat night . We went to "Bridget Jones Diary". It was a good chick movie.  Went to church and The Woodburn Tulip festival on Sunday.  Pretty neat to see fields of tulips.  Tell the kids we love them and are looking forward to good reports on their various activities.   Love U   Phil 
 Yo!    Things are OK here.   I  keep seeing your truck driving around here.   Its a bummer not seeing ya'll in it.   I hope you are settling in well.  There are new faces around here everyday.  I think this summer wil be pretty exciting.  Take care. 
 2 or 3 games of each soccer and baseball 4 tickets to each game.   Thanks! 
 Yes! and when you come visit I'll take my ring off my finger and stick it in your face and ask if you've seen my beautiful ring yet.  Then I'll sit next to my fellow and hold his hand in order to try to force you to get used to the idea that I am so in love and that this is all so right, even though  I  and especially my fellow look extremely constipated.   I will not be attending the wedding. 
 Are you nuts?

 Just heard some Austin Powers sound bites reverberate through the floor.  It reminded me of the good ol days. How the hell are you doing bcwd? 
 THANKS!!!!!!!!  YOU ARE AMAZING! 
 I'm still debating.  I have been invited to Jackson Hole the week before by some power brokers in NYC. I don;t necessarily have to go to that but in light of recent developments at Enron, I may have to look at some networking opportunities there. 
 Hell yes!  Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone. 
   Please see attached.  I look forward to workin with you Kate! 
  Brysch is fine.  I guess he bought a boat for fishing in the Bay.  He is still in Broadband and I think is safe.  With his skills he should be one of the guys to turn out the lights if that is to happen.  Enron Sucks.  The CFO and Skilling took my retirement for themselves.  I want to piss on them. 
  which is da best
