 Is this a yearly contract or month to month? Do you want 30 day notice  or 60 day for year contract? 
 Here is the contract,  I am still working on the confirm.  Do you want me to send the contract/confirm to the customer or will you? 
 That works for me.  Thanks ! 
 Here is the draft.  Prior to sending to customer, Jay please look at the MAC language and advise is it needs to be reworded.  Also, is this a political sub-division? If so, I will need to add a provision for same. 
 Attached is a draft of the Master for CIMA Energy LLC.  Please provided me with the email address or physical address for the contact on your credit sheet.     Mountaineer Gas has been sent to customer by S. Dickson Giant Industries  was sent to G. Gilbert for delivery to customer. El Paso Company draft was been sent. 
  Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.  We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.  FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.   dp  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Legal 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com 713-853-7658 713-646-3490 Fax

  We have executed documents from the customer both a contract and confrim.  They will be fully exeucted by ENA and returned to the customer as such.  Confirmations regarding this contract must be confirmed under this agreement in the name of ENA.  We will not undo this agreement. 
 We need a written letter from the previous agent regarding transfer to new agent as well as a written document from the new agent consenting to same.  In addition,  the contract party should consent and acknowledge this transfer in written form.

  I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen= tence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete th= is as it does not allow for Force Majeure.  FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome= r may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed= Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r= equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du= ring selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request = must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the= last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.= A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible= Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix= ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which= a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original = Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to= the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac= ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles= s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit= y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant= ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without = limitation events of Force Majeure.  For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20  Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,= in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo= graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele= vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t= hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u= nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average= of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin= t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D= ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d= etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced= ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo= t Price can be determined.  Let  me know what you think.  dp  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Legal 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com 713-853-7658 713-646-3490 Fax

This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the "Indemnity Period").  With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and delivery. 2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed $_____________ (the "Maximum Limit"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or application of any collateral by Contract Party. 3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor. 4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby WAIVES. 5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that: (i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity. 6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information described in Appendix "1" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in accordance therewith. 7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or sent by facsimile, as follows: To Guarantor: ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ To Contract Party: ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ Notice given by personal delivery or mail shall be effective upon actual receipt.

Any party may change its address to which notice is to be given hereunder by providing notice of same in accordance with this Section 7. 8.  LAW, WAIVERS, MISCELLANEOUS.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.  Guarantor WAIVES all right to require marshaling of assets and liabilities, sale in inverse order of alienation, notice of disposition of collateral and notice of acceptance of this Guaranty.  The Transaction Procedures set forth in the Gas Contract are acknowledged and agreed to by Guarantor and Guarantor agrees not to contest the validity or enforceability of any Transaction entered into in accordance with the Transaction Procedures under applicable law relating to whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be thereby bound.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived, supple-mented or terminated except in a writing signed by the parties hereto.

Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract (the "Obligations"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the "Indemnity Period").  With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.

 Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction. Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further assistance.  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 With regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 30 day firm transactions.  The system gives priority to Master Agreements over GISBs. All things equal,  a 30 day firm transaction will attach to the master before the GISB.  Hope this helps.  dp  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Marcia,  Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses are as follows:  Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language.  Netting:  We suggest the following:  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.  Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days.  Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For interruptible delivery there is no limit.  We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts.  Regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

 Further to our conversation, please see attachment regarding warranty and netting. Disregard the section on "Non-Warranted Gas" as this does not apply to our negotiations.    Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

 Gary,  I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows:  Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of Law we will agree to  New York or Texas.  Special Provisions:  1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording. 2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.  We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.  As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need for the GISB.  Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would like to proceed.   Regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp. Legal Department 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 dperlin@enron.com Phone 713-853-7658 Fax  713-646-3490
