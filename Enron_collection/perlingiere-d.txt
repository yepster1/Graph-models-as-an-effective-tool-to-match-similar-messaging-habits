 Is this a yearly contract or month to month? Do you want 30 day notice  or 60 day for year contract? 
 Here is the contract,  I am still working on the confirm.  Do you want me to send the contract/confirm to the customer or will you? 
 That works for me.  Thanks ! 
 Here is the draft.  Prior to sending to customer, Jay please look at the MAC language and advise is it needs to be reworded.  Also, is this a political sub-division? If so, I will need to add a provision for same. 
 Attached is a draft of the Master for CIMA Energy LLC.  Please provided me with the email address or physical address for the contact on your credit sheet.     Mountaineer Gas has been sent to customer by S. Dickson Giant Industries  was sent to G. Gilbert for delivery to customer. El Paso Company draft was been sent. 
  Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.  We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.  FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.   dp  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Legal 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com 713-853-7658 713-646-3490 Fax

  We have executed documents from the customer both a contract and confrim.  They will be fully exeucted by ENA and returned to the customer as such.  Confirmations regarding this contract must be confirmed under this agreement in the name of ENA.  We will not undo this agreement. 
 We need a written letter from the previous agent regarding transfer to new agent as well as a written document from the new agent consenting to same.  In addition,  the contract party should consent and acknowledge this transfer in written form. 
 the worksheet was not attached.

  I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen= tence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete th= is as it does not allow for Force Majeure.  FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome= r may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed= Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r= equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du= ring selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request = must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the= last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.= A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible= Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix= ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which= a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original = Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to= the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac= ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles= s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit= y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant= ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without = limitation events of Force Majeure.  For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20  Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,= in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo= graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele= vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t= hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u= nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average= of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin= t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D= ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d= etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced= ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo= t Price can be determined.  Let  me know what you think.  dp  Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Legal 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com 713-853-7658 713-646-3490 Fax
