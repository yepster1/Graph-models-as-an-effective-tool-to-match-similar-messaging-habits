&gt;We believe Eve should be somewhat more mana gated than she is at present, now that Runeglaive's in the game. We don't want to create a situation where she's OOM all the time, but adding some cost (as opposed to the current free) to the W, thereby limiting either its use or her use of other spells a bit, is we think appropriate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Power wise we also believe Eve's too strong at present in regular (non professional) play. We don't make changes driven purely by statistics (we aim for data informed, not data driven's). Eve's certainly right up there in terms of raw win rate though, with from memory the 4th or 5th highest winrate in the game at present when comparing champions as played by people with substantial experience on them. Eve's got a pretty steep mastery curve, so if her overall performance looks average it often means that her performance when played well is excessive even for someone on a champion they've played a lot (a phenomena also strongly demonstrated by other champs like Azir and Le Blanc who, if they're showing a 50% win rate in solo queue, are almost certainly very overpowered).

 **in depth look at champions pick ban priority coming to worlds**

&gt;coming to worlds i wanted to write a bit about the picks for worlds i will cover who will be picked the with tiers and say why i think they will be picked more or less and if they may get picked more   
&gt;  
&gt;**god tier**   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:117}} lulu - 100% picked or banned in the the regional finals of europe 85% in the regional finals of NA 85% in the Chinese regional finals lulu was picked or banned 12 times 85% pick or ban in the korean summer playoffs she was picked or banned 71% in the last 2 series (kt vs koo ,kt vs skt) she was 100% picked or banned and picked by both teams in the 5th game (blind pick) in the Regional Finals she was 100% pick/ban (all but the blind pick game) with many builds coming in (morellos ROA and unholy all has seen play in the matches talked about above)she provides wave clear and a second support for adcs she makes them quite tanky and help hayper carries doing their weak mid game, she also allows them to hit the turret whiled taking low amount of damage while taking down a turret and thus makes them able to siege better she can also save them from being bursted by an assassin she is going to be one of the most contested picks in worlds this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:268}} Azir -  azir was picked or banned 100% in the summer playoffs in korea the regional finals in korea and china north america only europe picked or banned it 82%, azir has since been nerfed he is still played by pro players he is more valuable to ganks following the nerf so he may fall out of favor for a few teams i can see him still being picked in a high % and banned his big range lets him farm safely his e also lets him escape very easily also his ability to create a turret and siege well is still there i think he will still be highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:41}} gangplank - one of the strongest champions coming in to worlds the ability to flex him makes him really good his ult gives him global pressure and lets him farm till he reaches his core items a big counter coming in to worlds is riven but with gp seeing play in the midlane few mids will try to go riven mid vs him,    
&gt;his waveclear is really good he can block paths with his kegs has a heal also cleanses cc he can set up traps and his kegs give him a good objective control (blocking the path in) his dmg with q+e with crit is insane he can almost 1 shot carries with 3 items his scaling will keep on and he will become terrifying late game and will be able to 1 shot a carry, he will be key for pick ban phases in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:64}} lee sin - lee sin has seen play this year but nothing like last year where he was by far the most played jungler, following the recent buff and nerfs to most other junglers in worlds he will see(ha ha) play,their are  junglers that would rate him very highly like TBQ,Kakao,hojin and many more his early pressure is his key strength and many of the junglers in this high level know how to abuse it expect him to see play and maybe a banned vs the truly best at the champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:201}} braum - might be the best support coming in to worlds, his ability to block skillshots for adc and peel for it is his best trait his q slows and lets adc follow on it easily he is the best support vs poke comps and will be one of the most contested supports.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:122}} daruis - daruis is just really strong right now his q heals him up to 36% miss hp or 12% if he hits one vs the enemy laner, he w restes his aa animation and slows for 90% for 1 second, his e is an aoe pull that applies 90% slow and in a addition to it he gets at max level on e 25% armor pen almost an entire LW worth of armor pen and with his bleed with black cleaver he shreds armor so fast.   
&gt;with his heal, low cd and execute make him a big threat in a team fight and split pushing if he gets the right team fight he can clean up an entire team with his execute together with his strong laning and going tank he is one of the strongest top laners atm and would be highly contested in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:429}} kalista - kalista will keep being 100% banned or picked imo she is very strong atm she kites so well and has a burst ability that slows scouts for ganks ult to save support and also extra cc   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**almost god tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:245}} ekko - ekko got some ap ratio buffs with tp on mid laners, he has a lot of damage on his passive, his ult damage is crazy and underrated and his shield ap ratio is really good also the zone control from him is great he also hasa good stun and can be flexed to jungle or top lane i think we will see him as a highly contested pick this worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:22}} ashe - ashe is in a good state right her ability to offer cc and a main engage tool in a meta that will most likely be focused on carry top lanres make her a good pick for this meta she is also a safe laner with a large range and slow on aa and w witch is really good for kiting juggernauts (untill they get dead man's plate or support gets coin for them)  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:60}} elise - one of the best early junglers in the game atm even with the nerfs she is still very strong and will be a top pick and highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:4}} twisted fate - twisted fate before coming in was already quite strong and was going to be picked but now many play him with tp this makes tf in some ways super global he can ult bot lane and tp top and double gank he can also ult to bot and come back to mid before he loses a wave to turret he will be quite contested after knowing his lane match up he will have a double global pressure and will let him be very strong and crate a lot of pressure he might also be able to split push might become very contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:28}} evelynn  - evelynn is very strong currently she can go ap or ad then tanky and provide a lot of damage her key strength is stealth teams who do not have strong vision play will be at a bad spot vs her you need to ward her camps to see her or pink at spots where you will see her coming to your lane for some teams this will be hard to execute due to poor communication. you will also need to be careful of her flanking your team, her ability to crate pressure even if she is not at that spot (for example bot lane playing more careful for gank they cannot see or a team not engaging because it may be a trap) makes her top tier.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:114}} fiora -  [shot summary of fiora](http://esports.inquirer.net/11204/totally-called-it) she also has a chance getting picked mid she can be a flex pick to those teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:67}} vayne - a lot of adcs have been practicing vayne while her range is very shot and she cant siege her ability to kite in this meta is really big   
&gt;she will most likely be highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A tier**   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:82}} mordekiaser - morde will most likely be one of the most contested picks in this worlds he is so strong that the moment he is picked he changes priority for the entire team dragon is worth so much more for both teams the junglers will be forced to camp bot ( the one that will face morde will want to abuse the fact that he is pushing while the jungler that is with morde will want to get dragon asap and counter gank so that morde). the biggest problem i see or can think of is lane swap on morde because we have not seen him played in competitive before this i wonder if it fucks him over too much for example taking drake before he turns 6 will make him get 1 less drake that game that he can use to push a turret or force someone out of lane his power is also in the fact that he levels the fastest in the duo lane while in lane swap the support will roam that will make morde very vulnerable to ganks i have no seen it played by pros in a highly competitive environment so this is a lot of speculation i feel like we will see him just because of his burst and ability to get a free tank who does dmg with drake while still keeping the ultimate.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:18}} tristana - highly contested pick tristana's ability to take turrets very fast in the mid game make her a strong pick with great scaling to the late game as well tristana will be one of the most contested pick in adc when kalista is banned.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:421}} rek'sai - rek'sai got nerfed in patch 5.17 this nerf wont make her useless but he it will make get get a bit less healthy when clearing camps other then that she will be played in worlds somewhat picked as a second tier jungler.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:12}} alistar - alistar has a very strong team fighting ability if he hit his combo on more then 3 people he can turn fights aswell as the fact he becomes a tank just by using his ult, with his heal you can do krugs/gromp fairly easily without losing too much hp,other then that he is a very good engage/follow up and is one of the best supports in providing cc doing a team fights and giving an easy engage of someone to follow up or follow up himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:131}} diana - she can assassinate split push and also take tp to the midlane you can flex her top in some cases with tp she can tp to bot and snowball quite hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:103}} ahri assassin great for pick comps overall one of the best assassins in the game coming into worlds her ability to kill carry with 1 combo makes her really good as well as sustain in lane and a great way to pick off someone.  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;{{champion:92}} riven - she will be picked mostly to counter GP while this tournament is with quite a lot of riven players (fabiven, huni. smeb,faker just to name some) with gp going mid aswel it is a huge boon for fnatic and skt that their midlaners can play riven it also adds a flex to these teams and can be a real mind game when with pick ban facing vs gangplank because both of those picks can flex (riven mid but gp will be taken by the top laner).  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:96}} kog'maw - one of the best scaling champions in the games.   
&gt;ap kog - the best poke in game and great scaling he can almost solo carry late game % hp damage and has a crazy range this ult somewhat weak laning (maybe someone will try it with tp ?) he might be picked at some point as a comfort pick for someone or maybe for elite poke and hard scaling.    
&gt;ad kog - ok laning and with the trinity force first buy is decent mid game he keeps scaling to being on of the best adcs late game with a great slow armor and mr shred and % hp damage and his ult is really good for scouting if they are doing dragon baron or are baiting as well as doing good damage.  
&gt;also works really good with lulu if she passes the ban phase and they pick both he becomes really strong much faster and a huge threat and can carry the game only him and lulu almost.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:112}} viktor - one of the best wave clears in the game insane damage and great zoning viktor is one of the best control mages in the game atm his ability to burst and block paths is almost unparalleled in the entire game, coming in to worlds it looks like many mids will take tp this will make viktor a bit weaker his strength of bullying in lane those champions wont be as effective while he himself would not benefit from tp taking that much this makes him a bit worse then he was before. the tp allows for mid laners to tp back to lane buy and be full mana and not lose a wave they also would not need to use it to tp to bot like the top laner they can just walk and mostly use it at the start to have a better laning phase.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:157}} yasou - comfort pick for some mid laners, some knock up champions are in the meta to help him, scales really good into the late game can counter gnar and can follow up really good with his ult, is a flex for some teams (rookie is a god on him).  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:127}} lissanadra - between all of the juggernauts changes the lissandra buff was ignored her ability to heal gives her better all in other then that she got a good wave clear and lots of cc i think she will be a great top laner that can flex mid.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:72}} skarnar - with his new stun and really good jungler clear skarnar is one of the best objective control junglers in the game, he also has the abilty to gank early with his e his abilty to fight better next to objectives makes him one of the best skirmish junglers in the right spots he might become a very contested pick doing the tournament   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:412}} thresh with many great thresh players from across the world i dont doubt that thresh will be picked and maybe even banned vs some supports his ability to set up ganks for bot lane  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:98}} shen - split pushed a big tank with good cc that is aoe can make picks and has global pressure.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:40}} janna - the ultimate peel support janna provides shield heals and cc to help the adc even with the nerfs she will most likely see play in worlds maybe just not as contested as season 4.     
&gt;  
&gt;**B tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:57}} maokai - following his recent nerf i dont think we will see him as contested as he was before he will probably be picked from time to time and will serve as a good tanky team fighter and a pocket pick for top laners.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:42}} corki - one of the most standard adc mid game powerspike good lane provides magic damage got wave clear and poke  will be picked will never be banned ok adc with kalista and morde most likely banned he will be one of the adcs picked.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:59}} jarvan IV - he recently got buffed i do not think he will see him as top tier but as a comfort pick or a comp pick him can work out very well.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:2}} olaf - will be a flex for fnatic can run at the adc ignore cc and try to kill the carry and kind of zone the adc out of the fight.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:61}} orianna - one of the most consistent champions in the game, she has it all speed buff slows hard cc ultimate that you can combine with other engages wave clear and a shield her kit is great does not make her super strong and yet not super weak and just like corki she will see play simply because of her solid laning wave clear and strong team fighting the biggest thing coming into the meta that makes her a bit better is the taking of tp she can match tp with the other mid laner so she can follow them with tps to bot lane of top.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:85}} Kennen - support kennen has been very popular for quite a while in the east, there is a slim chance we will see him in solo lanes this year but with tp going on mids i think he might be a pocket pick for a some teams as a flex.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:150}} gnar - a strong cc champion who split push the biggest problems i see for gnar atm is that yasou and daruis can be picked to counter him and better champions to split push with have being buffed.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:238}} zed - one of the best duelists in the game with good laning phase he can counter azir his transition in the mid game to a split pusher make his only an ok pick but because he is a comfort pick for so many mid laners he will most likely be picked.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:110}} varus - this last season varus was mainly used as a mid pick with great poke coming into worlds my feel is that he will fall out of flavor mid but we may see him as adc, he has great poke and some max hp damage but his ability to engage as an adc is what imo will bring him into play in this top focused meta taking the duty to the adc from the top laner will allow more carry style tops this makes ashe and varus 2 picks that will fit the meta   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:69}} cassiopeia - lpl lck lms still played cassio after the nerfs there is a good chance players from the east will pick her(unless soaz wants to tilt tsm). her abilty to chase down a target and kill him, the zone control with aoe slow and also aoe stun with her ult makes her quite good, she scales really good into the late game.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:25}} morgana - a pocket pick to counter some match ups in the bot lane really good at making picks great cc, can protect adc from cc, bronze wave clear as support, and can use her ult as a zoning tool, overall morgana is a pocker pick for many supports and she will likely see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:16}} soraka - her ability to save a low ally makes her very good in lane she grants sustain to a team and with coin she is quite good vs poke comp, her ability to counter a dive effectively and global heal makes her a sleeper pick that can show up big in worlds.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:79}} gragas - got nerfed quite a lot i think that because of it lee sin elise skarnar and eve will be better picks then him i can still see him as a comfort pick for some junglers.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:236}} lucian - he is a comfort pick for many adcs his ult can melt a carry and him ability to kite with is good the only reason that i think he will be picked outside of being comfort for that adc is facing tanks if he gets botrk his passive procs botrk 2 times this makes him one of the best adcs in the game to face hp stacking tanks.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:81}} ezreal - he is quite a comfort pick for some adcs due to his great mobility he recently got buffed aswell he will not be a power pick but i can see some adcs playing it and maybe a few mids as a pocket pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:111}} nautilus - cc god naut was strong across the season and is still one of the only ways to get kalista so i still see him being picked this worlds if certain conditions are met, his problem atm is vs vayne other then that i think he can lane great and his cc makes him a good support to have as a pocket pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:126}} jayce - jayce might come back for this worlds with strong poke and good wave clear i think he might see play.   
&gt;   
&gt;{{champion:15}} sivir - sivir had her ult nerfed quite a lot doing this year i feel like she is in an ok spot but she is not top tier adc and there are other adcs that will be played in worlds however sivir will still be played when teams will need wave clear or an extra tool for engage.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:7}} le blanc - comfort pick for many mid laners can set up with her e ganks she is played by pro players in solo q not sure if she will see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:68}} rumble - this is not the best meta for rumble together with the nerf he got he will be picked for a good match up or be used by players who consider his ability to teamfight more then his somewhat weak laning vs some one the meta picks.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:20}} nunu - nunu is a standard jungler i wont be shocked to see him be played at worlds with an objective focused team comp, his ability to secure objectives is one of a kind   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:54}} malphite - strong ult with engage that and win a game has AS slows and build armor mostly was good vs fizz looking forward to see vs what he will be used in worlds but i am still sure he will be picked but he might be a pocket pick for some teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:222}} jinx - jinx is a comfort pick to some adcs that is mostly how she will see play she is not a top tier pick and wont be contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;**C tier** (for cheese)   
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;{{champion:119}} draven - he will most likely be a pocket pick for some teams and might be used in an attempt to snowball from the WC teams he is very good vs vayne and might be good vs morde his biggest strength is that if he gets a kill he can snowball out of control he is a high risk high reward champ and will most likely stay as a pocket pick for teams for a Bo5 or in an attempt to get out of groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:432}} bard - one of the most underrated supports with a good cc for 2 champions in tf its easy to hit he is really good with objective control (his ult) can make picks has a good escape with greeted stun following it can make a really good pathing for a gank for the jungler can save from picks while he can also set up picks may if he is paired with tf will still most likley not see so much play maybe will be used to a cheese.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:86}} Garen - will still not see play in worlds following the bug found (see patch notes 5.19) and being very easy to kite he will not see play most likely the only thing that may benfit him is the fact that riven may be picked and he is a decent counter.    
&gt;{{champion:53}} blitzcrank - will only be picked with morde his pick potential his great and with the lockdown from e he can get morde a good way to proc his q and burst the enemy carries and get picks he will also grant a good option to control drake while it is key for morde gameplay,  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:8}} Vladimir - good flex pick might be a pocket pick for some teams but most likely will not see play.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:36}} dr mundo - one of those korean picks that you see from time to time in lck he is very unlikely to be picked but he might be picked vs some cheese strat.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:3}} galio - the cheese pick that comes very rarely might be picked with the recent buffs and we might see galio mid or top and maybe even support, his wave clear is decent and he has a great aoe cc but he will still need the enemy team to have a good amount of Apc with morde on the table and maybe an ap top laner i can see galio being picked in red side in a bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:89}} leona - a pocket pick for many supports her ability to lock down carries allows her to be in the back pocket and be pulled out from time to time.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:76}} nidalee - while the nidalee nerfs made her a bit weak in the lpl regional she was still banned from carry junglers she might turn up in worlds but it is unlikely.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:29}} twitch - really good vs poke comps got some small buffs that help him get to mid game and try to kill the carries had a really strong ult and he can sneak to kill people and maybe flank.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:1}} annie - strong aoe cc to get picks or engage she is never off the table as support she may be picked as cheese as a mid with tp.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:106}} volibear - with the dead man's plate in the game it makes volibear a good pick in the jungle he might show up as a surprise pick he scales well and has a really great execute he might show up as a surprise pick by some team.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:63}} brand - he will most likely used as support if he is used he has great damage and is a good cheese and a stun might be a pocket pick for some supports.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:161}} velkoz - while unlike brand his chances of being at mid as a cheese are ok he will most likely used as support if he is used he has True damage proc slows and knock ups his base damage is really high so it will be an interesting pick he might be a pocket pick for some teams coming to the bo5 of group stages.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:134}} syndra - syndra's best chance of getting picked is as counter to azir or viktor other then that i think she might be a pocket pick for some mid laners coming to bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:39}} irilea - a carry top that maybe be played by some players will probably be a comfort pick for them (steak) for others it may be a pocket pick for the bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;**sleepers **(can turn out to be top tier picks)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:34}} anivia - anvia will most likely be played in worlds her wave clear is great she got greats cc and can block paths she also got good match ups vs some mids that will be picked but maybe the biggest thing is the use of tp she can use it to escape in egg form and coming back to lane, she also counter juggernauts fairly well with her cc and ability to block their paths as well as her great scaling makes her a good pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:223}} tahm kench - i think he might be quite big in worlds in the jungle role the fact that him stacking hp makes him very strong synergizes with cinderhulk when he gets dead man's plate he can run really dast at you eat you and deal 50% of your hp he might become a contested jungler doing the tournament like rumble last year.    
&gt;at the support front he might see play with kalista in lane or morde other then taht i dont think he is a great support.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:24}} jax - "surprise i'm back" jax got buffed the godly split pusher he will be a pocket pick for many top laners his abilty to split push and scale super well into the lane game makes him good for the meta and good overall.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:56}} nocturne - nocturne will most likely see play this worlds following the recent buffs with the only jungler to play him pre buff (kakao) in worlds i think it will be in his champion pool and would be cool if he pulled it out other then him i feel like noc can only be played with certain mid laners or top laners he needs one of the following to be good in case he falls behind (shen,twisted fate,lulu,orianna) the first 2 bring global pressure and can follow nocturne and create picks shen as well lets him go deep and try to reach the back line and get the adc, the latter 2 will give nocturne's great range for engage great cc with lulu ult and orianna shockwave he can kill the back line and create great engage and openings,   
&gt;nocturne is a great jungler for specific comps and in the right hands he can be terrifying.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:26}} zillean- xp maybe morde counter 99% slow at max rank e ult can save from pick or burst if you hit the 2 bombs the aoe stun is very strong  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:45}} veigar - veigar became known as a power house when froggen started playing him on steam that show how the buff he got on w made him very strong,his ability to stack ap makes him scale while csing he does crazy amounts of damage (his ult and w both have 100% ap ratio) together with the fact that you max your e second now that grants him an aoe zoning tool who can stun for 2.5 secons(!) witch lets him hit his q and w easily and if he wants he can pop most carries but for ap carries it would be the worst.  
&gt;the biggest thing that helps him in pro play is that fact he can grab tp and keep farming until he reaches his power spike aswell as being able to tp bot and get kills and snowball, the thing is what forced the change to veigar was his e and the fact that he was stated being played as support in the east and it looks like some supports (PYL) started playing him at the support role and with a 2.5 sec stun that its aoe and a huge zoning tool and an ult that can hurt ap carries just for building ap support veigar may also be played this makes him much stronger from a pick/ban prospective, when you can flex him to support this allows the option to bait the other team to show their mid pick (or wonder if he goes mid or supp)and you get a small lead in champions select when you can counter pick their midlaner (or just have a mind game on them) this is used like tf jungle pick ban from uol or varus adc from uol having a flex is very good but having a flex that that other team does not know have can win you the pick ban.(or at least the lane you did it for get a lead) veigar is a champion that will be defined by world's pace kind of how bo5 crate their own meta of what is highly contested same will go for worlds and veigar he will do well he will be pick/ban and will be one of the most contested picks in worlds if he however does very badly and wont make it out of lane too farmed he will be like he was just before worlds not pick or ban worthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:38}} kassadin is a very good pick when you counter pick certain mids of pick that may become meta that he counters is veigar also many other apc have hard time vs kassadin in lane aswell as the fact he is a flex pick makes him a decent pick that is really good if the match up is favorable.   
&gt;the fact that he can take tp now like xpeke used to do (see backdoor) makes him in my eyes a much better pick that can be contested in certain scenarios.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:13}} ryze - while ryze is not as strong is "perma snare" ryze was he is still a a strong late game carry with decent laning i think he will be picked mostly by eastern teams as a top laner.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:74}} heimerdinger - the pocket pick of huni, himer is a very fast objective taker all he can can do baron around 22 min with a tank and adc, his ult is really strong it gives him a strong engage tool with upgaded e and a huge burst with upgraded w (does 1180 flat dmg +216% ap [if all rockets hit]) he will mostly be used as a cheese that can take super early drakes with the right junglers and cry fast and early barons (nunu himer might be the picks for it)

 **in depth look at champions pick ban priority coming to worlds**

&gt;coming to worlds i wanted to write a bit about the picks for worlds i will cover who will be picked the with tiers and say why i think they will be picked more or less and if they may get picked more   
&gt;  
&gt;**god tier**   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:117}} lulu - 100% picked or banned in the the regional finals of europe 85% in the regional finals of NA 85% in the Chinese regional finals lulu was picked or banned 12 times 85% pick or ban in the korean summer playoffs she was picked or banned 71% in the last 2 series (kt vs koo ,kt vs skt) she was 100% picked or banned and picked by both teams in the 5th game (blind pick) in the Regional Finals she was 100% pick/ban (all but the blind pick game) with many builds coming in (morellos ROA and unholy all has seen play in the matches talked about above)she provides wave clear and a second support for adcs she makes them quite tanky and help hayper carries doing their weak mid game, she also allows them to hit the turret whiled taking low amount of damage while taking down a turret and thus makes them able to siege better she can also save them from being bursted by an assassin she is going to be one of the most contested picks in worlds this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:268}} Azir -  azir was picked or banned 100% in the summer playoffs in korea the regional finals in korea and china north america only europe picked or banned it 82%, azir has since been nerfed he is still played by pro players he is more valuable to ganks following the nerf so he may fall out of favor for a few teams i can see him still being picked in a high % and banned his big range lets him farm safely his e also lets him escape very easily also his ability to create a turret and siege well is still there i think he will still be highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:41}} gangplank - one of the strongest champions coming in to worlds the ability to flex him makes him really good his ult gives him global pressure and lets him farm till he reaches his core items a big counter coming in to worlds is riven but with gp seeing play in the midlane few mids will try to go riven mid vs him,    
&gt;his waveclear is really good he can block paths with his kegs has a heal also cleanses cc he can set up traps and his kegs give him a good objective control (blocking the path in) his dmg with q+e with crit is insane he can almost 1 shot carries with 3 items his scaling will keep on and he will become terrifying late game and will be able to 1 shot a carry, he will be key for pick ban phases in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:64}} lee sin - lee sin has seen play this year but nothing like last year where he was by far the most played jungler, following the recent buff and nerfs to most other junglers in worlds he will see(ha ha) play,their are  junglers that would rate him very highly like TBQ,Kakao,hojin and many more his early pressure is his key strength and many of the junglers in this high level know how to abuse it expect him to see play and maybe a banned vs the truly best at the champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:201}} braum - might be the best support coming in to worlds, his ability to block skillshots for adc and peel for it is his best trait his q slows and lets adc follow on it easily he is the best support vs poke comps and will be one of the most contested supports.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:122}} daruis - daruis is just really strong right now his q heals him up to 36% miss hp or 12% if he hits one vs the enemy laner, he w restes his aa animation and slows for 90% for 1 second, his e is an aoe pull that applies 90% slow and in a addition to it he gets at max level on e 25% armor pen almost an entire LW worth of armor pen and with his bleed with black cleaver he shreds armor so fast.   
&gt;with his heal, low cd and execute make him a big threat in a team fight and split pushing if he gets the right team fight he can clean up an entire team with his execute together with his strong laning and going tank he is one of the strongest top laners atm and would be highly contested in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:429}} kalista - kalista will keep being 100% banned or picked imo she is very strong atm she kites so well and has a burst ability that slows scouts for ganks ult to save support and also extra cc   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**almost god tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:245}} ekko - ekko got some ap ratio buffs with tp on mid laners, he has a lot of damage on his passive, his ult damage is crazy and underrated and his shield ap ratio is really good also the zone control from him is great he also hasa good stun and can be flexed to jungle or top lane i think we will see him as a highly contested pick this worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:22}} ashe - ashe is in a good state right her ability to offer cc and a main engage tool in a meta that will most likely be focused on carry top lanres make her a good pick for this meta she is also a safe laner with a large range and slow on aa and w witch is really good for kiting juggernauts (untill they get dead man's plate or support gets coin for them)  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:60}} elise - one of the best early junglers in the game atm even with the nerfs she is still very strong and will be a top pick and highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:4}} twisted fate - twisted fate before coming in was already quite strong and was going to be picked but now many play him with tp this makes tf in some ways super global he can ult bot lane and tp top and double gank he can also ult to bot and come back to mid before he loses a wave to turret he will be quite contested after knowing his lane match up he will have a double global pressure and will let him be very strong and crate a lot of pressure he might also be able to split push might become very contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:28}} evelynn  - evelynn is very strong currently she can go ap or ad then tanky and provide a lot of damage her key strength is stealth teams who do not have strong vision play will be at a bad spot vs her you need to ward her camps to see her or pink at spots where you will see her coming to your lane for some teams this will be hard to execute due to poor communication. you will also need to be careful of her flanking your team, her ability to crate pressure even if she is not at that spot (for example bot lane playing more careful for gank they cannot see or a team not engaging because it may be a trap) makes her top tier.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:114}} fiora -  [shot summary of fiora](http://esports.inquirer.net/11204/totally-called-it) she also has a chance getting picked mid she can be a flex pick to those teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:67}} vayne - a lot of adcs have been practicing vayne while her range is very shot and she cant siege her ability to kite in this meta is really big   
&gt;she will most likely be highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A tier**   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:82}} mordekiaser - morde will most likely be one of the most contested picks in this worlds he is so strong that the moment he is picked he changes priority for the entire team dragon is worth so much more for both teams the junglers will be forced to camp bot ( the one that will face morde will want to abuse the fact that he is pushing while the jungler that is with morde will want to get dragon asap and counter gank so that morde). the biggest problem i see or can think of is lane swap on morde because we have not seen him played in competitive before this i wonder if it fucks him over too much for example taking drake before he turns 6 will make him get 1 less drake that game that he can use to push a turret or force someone out of lane his power is also in the fact that he levels the fastest in the duo lane while in lane swap the support will roam that will make morde very vulnerable to ganks i have no seen it played by pros in a highly competitive environment so this is a lot of speculation i feel like we will see him just because of his burst and ability to get a free tank who does dmg with drake while still keeping the ultimate.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:18}} tristana - highly contested pick tristana's ability to take turrets very fast in the mid game make her a strong pick with great scaling to the late game as well tristana will be one of the most contested pick in adc when kalista is banned.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:421}} rek'sai - rek'sai semi contested pick that is second tier she is a comfort pick for many junglers so she will likely see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:12}} alistar - alistar has a very strong team fighting ability if he hit his combo on more then 3 people he can turn fights aswell as the fact he becomes a tank just by using his ult, with his heal you can do krugs/gromp fairly easily without losing too much hp,other then that he is a very good engage/follow up and is one of the best supports in providing cc doing a team fights and giving an easy engage of someone to follow up or follow up himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:131}} diana - she can assassinate split push and also take tp to the midlane you can flex her top in some cases with tp she can tp to bot and snowball quite hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:103}} ahri assassin great for pick comps overall one of the best assassins in the game coming into worlds her ability to kill carry with 1 combo makes her really good as well as sustain in lane and a great way to pick off someone.  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;{{champion:92}} riven - she will be picked mostly to counter GP while this tournament is with quite a lot of riven players (fabiven, huni. smeb,faker just to name some) with gp going mid aswel it is a huge boon for fnatic and skt that their midlaners can play riven it also adds a flex to these teams and can be a real mind game when with pick ban facing vs gangplank because both of those picks can flex (riven mid but gp will be taken by the top laner).  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:96}} kog'maw - one of the best scaling champions in the games.   
&gt;ap kog - the best poke in game and great scaling he can almost solo carry late game % hp damage and has a crazy range this ult somewhat weak laning (maybe someone will try it with tp ?) he might be picked at some point as a comfort pick for someone or maybe for elite poke and hard scaling.    
&gt;ad kog - ok laning and with the trinity force first buy is decent mid game he keeps scaling to being on of the best adcs late game with a great slow armor and mr shred and % hp damage and his ult is really good for scouting if they are doing dragon baron or are baiting as well as doing good damage.  
&gt;also works really good with lulu if she passes the ban phase and they pick both he becomes really strong much faster and a huge threat and can carry the game only him and lulu almost.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:112}} viktor - one of the best wave clears in the game insane damage and great zoning viktor is one of the best control mages in the game atm his ability to burst and block paths is almost unparalleled in the entire game, coming in to worlds it looks like many mids will take tp this will make viktor a bit weaker his strength of bullying in lane those champions wont be as effective while he himself would not benefit from tp taking that much this makes him a bit worse then he was before. the tp allows for mid laners to tp back to lane buy and be full mana and not lose a wave they also would not need to use it to tp to bot like the top laner they can just walk and mostly use it at the start to have a better laning phase.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:157}} yasou - comfort pick for some mid laners, some knock up champions are in the meta to help him, scales really good into the late game can counter gnar and can follow up really good with his ult, is a flex for some teams (rookie is a god on him).  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:127}} lissanadra - between all of the juggernauts changes the lissandra buff was ignored her ability to heal gives her better all in other then that she got a good wave clear and lots of cc i think she will be a great top laner that can flex mid.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:72}} skarnar - with his new stun and really good jungler clear skarnar is one of the best objective control junglers in the game, he also has the abilty to gank early with his e his abilty to fight better next to objectives makes him one of the best skirmish junglers in the right spots he might become a very contested pick doing the tournament   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:412}} thresh with many great thresh players from across the world i dont doubt that thresh will be picked and maybe even banned vs some supports his ability to set up ganks for bot lane  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:98}} shen - split pushed a big tank with good cc that is aoe can make picks and has global pressure.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:40}} janna - the ultimate peel support janna provides shield heals and cc to help the adc even with the nerfs she will most likely see play in worlds maybe just not as contested as season 4.     
&gt;  
&gt;**B tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:57}} maokai - following his recent nerf i dont think we will see him as contested as he was before he will probably be picked from time to time and will serve as a good tanky team fighter and a pocket pick for top laners.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:42}} corki - one of the most standard adc mid game powerspike good lane provides magic damage got wave clear and poke  will be picked will never be banned ok adc with kalista and morde most likely banned he will be one of the adcs picked.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:59}} jarvan IV - he recently got buffed i do not think he will see him as top tier but as a comfort pick or a comp pick him can work out very well.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:2}} olaf - will be a flex for fnatic can run at the adc ignore cc and try to kill the carry and kind of zone the adc out of the fight.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:61}} orianna - one of the most consistent champions in the game, she has it all speed buff slows hard cc ultimate that you can combine with other engages wave clear and a shield her kit is great does not make her super strong and yet not super weak and just like corki she will see play simply because of her solid laning wave clear and strong team fighting the biggest thing coming into the meta that makes her a bit better is the taking of tp she can match tp with the other mid laner so she can follow them with tps to bot lane of top.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:85}} Kennen - support kennen has been very popular for quite a while in the east, there is a slim chance we will see him in solo lanes this year but with tp going on mids i think he might be a pocket pick for a some teams as a flex.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:150}} gnar - a strong cc champion who split push the biggest problems i see for gnar atm is that yasou and daruis can be picked to counter him and better champions to split push with have being buffed.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:238}} zed - one of the best duelists in the game with good laning phase he can counter azir his transition in the mid game to a split pusher make his only an ok pick but because he is a comfort pick for so many mid laners he will most likely be picked.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:110}} varus - this last season varus was mainly used as a mid pick with great poke coming into worlds my feel is that he will fall out of flavor mid but we may see him as adc, he has great poke and some max hp damage but his ability to engage as an adc is what imo will bring him into play in this top focused meta taking the duty to the adc from the top laner will allow more carry style tops this makes ashe and varus 2 picks that will fit the meta   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:69}} cassiopeia - lpl lck lms still played cassio after the nerfs there is a good chance players from the east will pick her(unless soaz wants to tilt tsm). her abilty to chase down a target and kill him, the zone control with aoe slow and also aoe stun with her ult makes her quite good, she scales really good into the late game.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:25}} morgana - a pocket pick to counter some match ups in the bot lane really good at making picks great cc, can protect adc from cc, bronze wave clear as support, and can use her ult as a zoning tool, overall morgana is a pocker pick for many supports and she will likely see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:16}} soraka - her ability to save a low ally makes her very good in lane she grants sustain to a team and with coin she is quite good vs poke comp, her ability to counter a dive effectively and global heal makes her a sleeper pick that can show up big in worlds.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:79}} gragas - got nerfed quite a lot i think that because of it lee sin elise skarnar and eve will be better picks then him i can still see him as a comfort pick for some junglers.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:236}} lucian - he is a comfort pick for many adcs his ult can melt a carry and him ability to kite with is good the only reason that i think he will be picked outside of being comfort for that adc is facing tanks if he gets botrk his passive procs botrk 2 times this makes him one of the best adcs in the game to face hp stacking tanks.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:81}} ezreal - he is quite a comfort pick for some adcs due to his great mobility he recently got buffed aswell he will not be a power pick but i can see some adcs playing it and maybe a few mids as a pocket pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:111}} nautilus - cc god naut was strong across the season and is still one of the only ways to get kalista so i still see him being picked this worlds if certain conditions are met, his problem atm is vs vayne other then that i think he can lane great and his cc makes him a good support to have as a pocket pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:126}} jayce - jayce might come back for this worlds with strong poke and good wave clear i think he might see play.   
&gt;   
&gt;{{champion:15}} sivir - sivir had her ult nerfed quite a lot doing this year i feel like she is in an ok spot but she is not top tier adc and there are other adcs that will be played in worlds however sivir will still be played when teams will need wave clear or an extra tool for engage.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:7}} le blanc - comfort pick for many mid laners can set up with her e ganks she is played by pro players in solo q not sure if she will see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:68}} rumble - this is not the best meta for rumble together with the nerf he got he will be picked for a good match up or be used by players who consider his ability to teamfight more then his somewhat weak laning vs some one the meta picks.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:20}} nunu - nunu is a standard jungler i wont be shocked to see him be played at worlds with an objective focused team comp, his ability to secure objectives is one of a kind   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:54}} malphite - strong ult with engage that and win a game has AS slows and build armor mostly was good vs fizz looking forward to see vs what he will be used in worlds but i am still sure he will be picked but he might be a pocket pick for some teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:222}} jinx - jinx is a comfort pick to some adcs that is mostly how she will see play she is not a top tier pick and wont be contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;**C tier** (for cheese)   
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;{{champion:119}} draven - he will most likely be a pocket pick for some teams and might be used in an attempt to snowball from the WC teams he is very good vs vayne and might be good vs morde his biggest strength is that if he gets a kill he can snowball out of control he is a high risk high reward champ and will most likely stay as a pocket pick for teams for a Bo5 or in an attempt to get out of groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:432}} bard - one of the most underrated supports with a good cc for 2 champions in tf its easy to hit he is really good with objective control (his ult) can make picks has a good escape with greeted stun following it can make a really good pathing for a gank for the jungler can save from picks while he can also set up picks may if he is paired with tf will still most likley not see so much play maybe will be used to a cheese.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:86}} Garen - will still not see play in worlds following the bug found (see patch notes 5.19) and being very easy to kite he will not see play most likely the only thing that may benfit him is the fact that riven may be picked and he is a decent counter.    
&gt;{{champion:53}} blitzcrank - will only be picked with morde his pick potential his great and with the lockdown from e he can get morde a good way to proc his q and burst the enemy carries and get picks he will also grant a good option to control drake while it is key for morde gameplay,  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:8}} Vladimir - good flex pick might be a pocket pick for some teams but most likely will not see play.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:36}} dr mundo - one of those korean picks that you see from time to time in lck he is very unlikely to be picked but he might be picked vs some cheese strat.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:3}} galio - the cheese pick that comes very rarely might be picked with the recent buffs and we might see galio mid or top and maybe even support, his wave clear is decent and he has a great aoe cc but he will still need the enemy team to have a good amount of Apc with morde on the table and maybe an ap top laner i can see galio being picked in red side in a bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:89}} leona - a pocket pick for many supports her ability to lock down carries allows her to be in the back pocket and be pulled out from time to time.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:76}} nidalee - while the nidalee nerfs made her a bit weak in the lpl regional she was still banned from carry junglers she might turn up in worlds but it is unlikely.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:29}} twitch - really good vs poke comps got some small buffs that help him get to mid game and try to kill the carries had a really strong ult and he can sneak to kill people and maybe flank.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:1}} annie - strong aoe cc to get picks or engage she is never off the table as support she may be picked as cheese as a mid with tp.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:106}} volibear - with the dead man's plate in the game it makes volibear a good pick in the jungle he might show up as a surprise pick he scales well and has a really great execute he might show up as a surprise pick by some team.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:63}} brand - he will most likely used as support if he is used he has great damage and is a good cheese and a stun might be a pocket pick for some supports.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:161}} velkoz - while unlike brand his chances of being at mid as a cheese are ok he will most likely used as support if he is used he has True damage proc slows and knock ups his base damage is really high so it will be an interesting pick he might be a pocket pick for some teams coming to the bo5 of group stages.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:134}} syndra - syndra's best chance of getting picked is as counter to azir or viktor other then that i think she might be a pocket pick for some mid laners coming to bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:39}} irilea - a carry top that maybe be played by some players will probably be a comfort pick for them (steak) for others it may be a pocket pick for the bo5.  
&gt;  
&gt;**sleepers **(can turn out to be top tier picks)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:34}} anivia - anvia will most likely be played in worlds her wave clear is great she got greats cc and can block paths she also got good match ups vs some mids that will be picked but maybe the biggest thing is the use of tp she can use it to escape in egg form and coming back to lane, she also counter juggernauts fairly well with her cc and ability to block their paths as well as her great scaling makes her a good pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:223}} tahm kench - i think he might be quite big in worlds in the jungle role the fact that him stacking hp makes him very strong synergizes with cinderhulk when he gets dead man's plate he can run really dast at you eat you and deal 50% of your hp he might become a contested jungler doing the tournament like rumble last year.    
&gt;at the support front he might see play with kalista in lane or morde other then taht i dont think he is a great support.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:24}} jax - "surprise i'm back" jax got buffed the godly split pusher he will be a pocket pick for many top laners his abilty to split push and scale super well into the lane game makes him good for the meta and good overall.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:56}} nocturne - nocturne will most likely see play this worlds following the recent buffs with the only jungler to play him pre buff (kakao) in worlds i think it will be in his champion pool and would be cool if he pulled it out other then him i feel like noc can only be played with certain mid laners or top laners he needs one of the following to be good in case he falls behind (shen,twisted fate,lulu,orianna) the first 2 bring global pressure and can follow nocturne and create picks shen as well lets him go deep and try to reach the back line and get the adc, the latter 2 will give nocturne's great range for engage great cc with lulu ult and orianna shockwave he can kill the back line and create great engage and openings,   
&gt;nocturne is a great jungler for specific comps and in the right hands he can be terrifying.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:26}} zillean- xp maybe morde counter 99% slow at max rank e ult can save from pick or burst if you hit the 2 bombs the aoe stun is very strong  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:45}} veigar - veigar became known as a power house when froggen started playing him on steam that show how the buff he got on w made him very strong,his ability to stack ap makes him scale while csing he does crazy amounts of damage (his ult and w both have 100% ap ratio) together with the fact that you max your e second now that grants him an aoe zoning tool who can stun for 2.5 secons(!) witch lets him hit his q and w easily and if he wants he can pop most carries but for ap carries it would be the worst.  
&gt;the biggest thing that helps him in pro play is that fact he can grab tp and keep farming until he reaches his power spike aswell as being able to tp bot and get kills and snowball, the thing is what forced the change to veigar was his e and the fact that he was stated being played as support in the east and it looks like some supports (PYL) started playing him at the support role and with a 2.5 sec stun that its aoe and a huge zoning tool and an ult that can hurt ap carries just for building ap support veigar may also be played this makes him much stronger from a pick/ban prospective, when you can flex him to support this allows the option to bait the other team to show their mid pick (or wonder if he goes mid or supp)and you get a small lead in champions select when you can counter pick their midlaner (or just have a mind game on them) this is used like tf jungle pick ban from uol or varus adc from uol having a flex is very good but having a flex that that other team does not know have can win you the pick ban.(or at least the lane you did it for get a lead) veigar is a champion that will be defined by world's pace kind of how bo5 crate their own meta of what is highly contested same will go for worlds and veigar he will do well he will be pick/ban and will be one of the most contested picks in worlds if he however does very badly and wont make it out of lane too farmed he will be like he was just before worlds not pick or ban worthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:38}} kassadin is a very good pick when you counter pick certain mids of pick that may become meta that he counters is veigar also many other apc have hard time vs kassadin in lane aswell as the fact he is a flex pick makes him a decent pick that is really good if the match up is favorable.   
&gt;the fact that he can take tp now like xpeke used to do (see backdoor) makes him in my eyes a much better pick that can be contested in certain scenarios.   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:13}} ryze - while ryze is not as strong is "perma snare" ryze was he is still a a strong late game carry with decent laning i think he will be picked mostly by eastern teams as a top laner.    
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:74}} heimerdinger - the pocket pick of huni, himer is a very fast objective taker all he can can do baron around 22 min with a tank and adc, his ult is really strong it gives him a strong engage tool with upgaded e and a huge burst with upgraded w (does 1180 flat dmg +216% ap [if all rockets hit]) he will mostly be used as a cheese that can take super early drakes with the right junglers and cry fast and early barons (nunu himer might be the picks for it)

[Canastus wrote on 2015-10-01 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/mIwpjF8w-riot-regarding-your-philosophy-for-reworks):

 **@Riot - Regarding your philosophy for reworks.**

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/iPkFWhy.png  
&gt;  
&gt;So let me get this straight - if a popular champion like Riven or Lee Sin become the target of a rework, you're willing to revert your changes if they don't meet general expectations. Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**So how come some of the most controversial reworks** (Cassiopeia, Mordekaiser and Veigar to name some of them) **didn't receive the same kind of consideration from you?** Not only did these reworks cause a serious breach within the playerbase, they also showed how **inherently broken** any of your reworks are. Two of those mentioned champions had abyssmal winrates for months until they finally received some much needed numberbuffs.   
&gt;  
&gt;Naturally people started picking those champions once they finally did the job they were intended to do and what's your reaction? **In several cases you gut them into unviability - and we're back to square one.** The most prominent example has to be Cassiopeia, a champion whose rework marks the worst in the history of this game so far. **Zero interaction between the people in charge of the project and the affected playerbase, extended periods of radio silence and changes that no one even asked for.**   
&gt;  
&gt;It's just too bad her name wasn't Riven or Lee Sin, otherwise she would have been spared the inevitable gutting you enacted on her few months later. Now we're stuck with a champion who's lost their identity in favor of some twisted fantasy which even went as far to destroy any previous play- or build diversity she once had.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Your reworks all seem to follow a certain pattern - you're trying to force a champion into a certain nich\u00e9 while removing any playstyle they had before which went beyond that perceived role.**   
&gt;  
&gt;You don't seem to understand however that **this kind of freedom** was the main reason people even played those champions since it made them **flexibile and thus a lot more viable**. By killing any diversity they once possessed, you severely **dumbed them down** while alienating the people who were dedicated enough to master those champions.   
&gt;  
&gt;I think it's about time you started taking some responsibility for what you've done instead of leaving the affected parties in the dust after you've finished **violating their beloved champions without any hope of even influencing their development**.

&gt;(Artworks are for reference; credit goes to the original artists)  
&gt;  
&gt;#General Concept  
&gt;&gt;Once one of Demacia's greatest knights, Celes' life took a dark turn when she was sent to hunt a powerful necromancer and was defeated. In order to defeat him and prevent the necromancer from slaughtering a village of innocents, Celes accepted a cursed but very powerful sword from Aatrox, the Darkin Blade. The sword, Ebonmere, allowed Celes to defeat the necromancer, but its curse now afflicts Celes and threatens to corrupt her. Celes seeks to master the Ebonmere before it conquers her, and to use the dark weapon in the name of honor and justice.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;In gameplay, Celes is a melee juggernaut who can rapidly drain her own health in exchange for great power, and becomes more lethal as she approaches death. With a suite of powerful effects that give her an edge in any duel, and enough durability to catch many opponents off guard, Celes is a force to be reckoned with, and those who underestimate her can quickly end up dead. However, her ultimate, Ebonmere, is both her greatest weapon and can be a deadly weakness; the amount of health it drains is extremely high, and overusing it can quickly result in Celes dying. Players must carefully balance how much to use Ebonmere.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last Update: Oct. 1, 2015  
&gt;  
&gt;**Statistics** (numbers are subject to change)

&gt;

&gt;**E - Curse of Retribution**  
&gt;&gt;Celes releases a blast from her sword in target direction (skillshot, max. 600 range) that deals **60/90/120/150/180 (+0.8 bonus AD)** physical damage to the first enemy it hits and Curses it for 3 seconds. Whenever a Cursed enemy uses a basic attack or an ability, it takes **20/35/50/65/80 (+0.1 AP)** magic damage; each Curse proc deals 20% more than the previous one, but cannot be fatal.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;While Ebonmere is active, the skillshot is wider and pierces enemies, applying its full effect to all targets struck, and Celes gains **30/40/50%** bonus movement speed when moving toward a Cursed enemy Champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;12 second cooldown. No cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;**R - Ebonmere**  
&gt;&gt;**Toggled Off**: Celes gains 10/15/20% bonus lifesteal. Celes does not receive this bonus while Ebonmere is toggled on.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;**Toggled On**: Celes taps into the power of the Ebonmere, granting bonus effects on her basic abilities and +30/45/60 bonus attack damage; this attack damage bonus increases by 1.25% for every 1% of Celes' missing health, maxing out when Celes is below 20% of her maximum health. However, Celes' base life regeneration is reduced to 0 and she loses health equal to 2% of her maximum health every second. This upkeep cost increases by 6/8/10 health every second. Ebonmere automatically deactivates if Celes drops below 5% of her maximum health.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;8 second cooldown after deactivation. Cannot be deactivated during the first 3 seconds after being toggled on. Celes cannot activate Ebonmere if she is below 10% of her maximum health.  
&gt;  
&gt;#Tips  
&gt;&gt;**Playing as Celes**  
&gt;- Don't overdo it with Ebonmere! While it gives you a lot of power, it also drains your health rapidly. Try to avoid taking too much damage while using Ebonmere or you'll find yourself out of health in no time.  
&gt;- Try to save Cruel Justice for when you are very low on health to maximize the shield's strength and give your enemies a nasty surprise.  
&gt;- Curse of Retribution is most effective on enemies with high attack speed or those who spam abilities rapidly. Try to inflict the effect on such Champions to make them regret their aggression.  
&gt;- Celes needs both health and attack damage to maximize her capabilities. Sterak's Gage and Titanic Hydra are both great choices on her.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;**Playing against Celes**  
&gt;- Celes is a beast in a close-up fight, but is very vulnerable to being kited around. Keep forcing her to switch targets, especially when she has Ebonmere active, to make her burn out her own health. Once you have the upper hand, take advantage of her lack of retreat options.  
&gt;- Curse of Retribution's effect doesn't last long, but hurts a lot if you attack or use abilities too much during the duration. Try to wait it out before resuming your attack. But if you must keep attacking, remember that the Curse can't actually kill you!  
&gt;- Be careful when trying to finish Celes off - she gains bonus resistances when low on health and her shield gets stronger too. Save your crowd controls if you can so she can't put up much of a fight.  
&gt;- Celes' damage is primarily physical, and she lacks a built-in anti-armor solution, so armor items are very strong against her.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Champion Matchups**  
&gt;&gt;**Champions who synergize with Celes**  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:26}} - Zilean has everything Celes could want. Time Bomb gives her more close-in bang for her buck, while Time Warp gives her a huge speed boost with which to catch people. And thanks to Chronoshift, you can feel free to get way too reckless with using Ebonmere; if you overdo it, you'll get a do-over!  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:203}} - Kindred's ultimate is really what does it for you; being able to hover at 10% of your max HP thanks to Lamb's Respite can let you deal massive punishment to an enemy with Ebonmere and even the odds against yourself. Your health won't drain once you reach that threshold, and the inability to heal at that threshold is irrelevant to Celes until after it ends. Mounting Dread can also help you catch some enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:62}} - If there's one thing that can stop Celes' damage, it's armor. Wukong generally makes that irrelevant thanks to Crushing Blow, and his initiates with Nimbus Strike and Cyclone make it easy for Celes to get on top of the enemy and start dealing _**tons of damage**_. Wukong also tends to get Black Cleaver, so it's a win-win.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;**Champions who Celes struggles against**  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:254}} - Piltover's Enforcer loves to scrap in long-term fights, which plays against Celes' strengths. She's generally tough enough to take Ebonmere's damage, and Denting Blows is the perfect counter to juggernauts like you. And if you even think about trying to run, Vi can easily catch you with either Vault Breaker or Assault and Battery.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:17}} - Laning against the Yordle Scout is a major pain in the neck for Celes. Poke damage from Toxic Shot will give you a lot less time to work with Ebonmere once you activate it, and Blinding Dart will make your powerful attacks largely useless. Your straightforward approach to pursuits will also end badly thanks to Teemo's mushrooms, and Move Quick lets him kite you all day long.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;{{champion:106}} - Volibear is a surprisingly powerful duelist whose massive health pool and passive can easily tank your damage. He can also completely negate your attempts to retreat with Rolling Thunder, and once you get low on health he can execute you easily with Frenzy. Majestic Roar and Thunder Claws also means you won't be getting much help from minions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Login Theme** (this is just a basis; I didn't make it)  
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENPdhg59l-o  
&gt;  
&gt;#Design Intents  
&gt;&gt;(in case numbers are off, which they probably are)  
&gt;- Celes is designed to be extremely powerful in close-combat, but is vulnerable to being kited and harassed.  
&gt;- Celes has strong damage and durability, but lacks crowd control and mobility.  
&gt;- Celes can chase fairly well when she Curses an enemy and has her ultimate active, but has limited retreat options.  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;- Celes is meant to build health and attack damage, with lifesteal and resistances being optional, but not attack speed or crit chance.  
&gt;- Celes' power is at her strongest when she is near death, but she takes the greatest risks at this time.  
&gt;- Celes' Curse effect is designed to punish enemies who attack repeatedly or spam abilities while it afflicts them, but cannot kill an opponent by itself.  
&gt;- Celes' ultimate is meant to have significant health costs over time to provide huge risk in exchange for its huge power boost.  
&gt;- Lore-wise, Celes is supposed to introduce a "dark side" to Demacia's knights, but she values honor and justice. However, she is far more callous than her peers, and would willingly harm (but not kill) innocents to accomplish a task assigned to her.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;Tell me what you think about Celes. And please, don't freak out about any numbers; I'm sure I got some really off.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, and downvoting just because of the artwork is for asshats.

&gt;It\u2019s been awhile since we saw the original One For All on Summoner\u2019s Rift. A number of new champs have come out since its last run so we thought: why not bring back the OFA funtimes? :D   
&gt;  
&gt;A bit of trivia for those of you collecting random League knowledge: One For All was the very first featured game mode we ever made (almost 2 years ago this month!) o.O  
&gt;  
&gt;One For All is a 5v5 battle played on SR where everyone on your team uses the same champion, decided by a vote during champ select. Some champs have amazing synergy with themselves (Kalista? Kalista! :D) so enjoy exploring the possibilities.  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s been quite a few new champions (and many others reworked) since the last time we did OFA. We\u2019d like some help from you guys specifically testing out the following champions here on PBE before the mode goes live. **We\u2019ll be temporarily disabling all other champions in OFA for the first few days on PBE, just to help focus the initial testing on these below champs.**

&gt;To reiterate, when OFA goes live, ALL champions will be available to play. We\u2019re just limiting the pool here on PBE to help focus testing on the newer script-worked champs.  
&gt;

&gt;Can't speak in this game right now. Unless, you want to be a Martyr for the system to be changed. That's about the only reason to open your mouth. Ive talked here and there, but you really really have to walk on eggshells. You can't joke, you can't banter, you cant cuss, you cant do much of anything except pretend to be a bot spewing out gj's over and over.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you do, its over son. Right now is probably the worst time to even hit that enter key, with this stupid strike system. Because, I dont see how your chat is worth a ban much less a Chat Restriction.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've noticed people talk so much right now in my games. I mean, all the time. I can tell that CR's have ended. I actually feel sorry for most of them, because they are going to get banned for nothing. Some are raging and being dicks, some are just talking too much.  
&gt;  
&gt;And, talking too much, will make you lose your account. I think I saw a post like last week where a guy got banned for being too argumentative? I mean thats what they reached for to ban him? He was too argumentative in a competitive game? They couldn't throw racial slurs, or toxicity, or anything at him. He was just too argumentative and deserved it.

 **Need Some Fiora Clarity**

&gt;The League of Legends official champion info page did not update the passive correctly, so I can't relate to that page for vital information regarding my issue. http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/fiora/  
&gt;  
&gt;The main problem I have is the wiki's ability details for the passive: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fiora  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt; Attacked Vitals will alternate between spawning on either side of the target. That means if Fiora hits a passive on either the left or bottom sides of the target, the next one will be on the top or right side of them, and vice versa. However, Vitals that expire will not, and spawn randomly on any side.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is this stating that if Fiora hits a vital, it CANNOT spawn a new one EXACTLY where the last one was? If so, there is a bug where this is happening, quite frequently. I even had it happen three times in a row. It RNG wins a lane a lot of times and requires little skill to hit the same spot. With that in mind, if the above statement is NOT True and it is meant to RNG anywhere--even the same spot: can it not do that and have the above be True?  
&gt;  
&gt;I have 200 games on new Fiora, and I think this one change would be a proper nerf for her, and increase the need to be skillful on the champ. I just want people to stop banning her already. :(

&gt;Hey folks,

&gt;Despite being in the 5.19 patch notes and just having their champion spotlight released, I have to share the very sad news that Kindred will not be enabled until 5.20.  
&gt;  
&gt;We found an important, gameplay-impacting issue that we can't release, specifically related to Kindred. Rather than rush a fix out the door, we are going to take due diligence to maintain the integrity of the game and release Kindred (all fixed up) next patch, once it has had adequate coverage. Until that time I hope Worlds can sustain your hype train. We really can't wait to get this champ in your hands and see what you can do with them. They are (still) coming!

&gt;We've been talking about possible TP changes for the preseason. It's a spell that creates some really cool amounts and allows a range of additional strategies. Current thinking is that it may have become a bit too mandatory in many cases however, which then ends up reducing overall diversity rather than creating it. If that's the conclusion we settle on we'll probably make some small nerfs to it (CD at a guess).

 **Idea for Teleport change(nerf)**

&gt;Okay, I think its been no secret that Teleport is comparatively strong right now. Just today on reddit was a link to this interview:  
&gt;http://fragbite.se/fragtv/video/2505/vad-hade-proffsen-andrat-i-lol-om-de-fick-mojligheten  
&gt;Where pro players were asked what they felt like needs to be changed about the game, and 3 of them(xPeke, Neils, Incarnation) all said that teleport needs to be nerfed or removed.   
&gt;  
&gt;IMO the main "issue" with teleport right now is its mandatory for toplaners to take in high elo/competitive play. This is because without teleport toplaners have much less map pressure than the other roles do. For example, if one team's toplaner has ignite and the other teleport, the team with ignite cannot force any plays around objectives or dives because they run the risk of a 4 vs 5, or 3 vs 4, ect. This same logic is creeping into the midlane too; teleport is one of the most common mid lane summoners at worlds (If I were to guess it would be behind flash and ignite).   
&gt;  
&gt;But honestly, I think this is relatively healthy. If 90% of toplaners are taking teleport, and the only reason they take it is so they can participate in dragon fights/split push later in the game, then I think it's a healthy use of the summoner. After all, many other roles are dominated by 1 summoner, ADC's take heal usually, support takes exh, jungle smite, ect. And lets face it; teleport plays to dragon/baron are exciting to watch in the LCS and exciting to play as or against. Even teleport plays lategame with homeguards to make a pick or to splitpush are still balanced and appropriate.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is unhealthy about this is how champions with teleport exert too much map pressure, especially early-game/during the laning phase. When a jungler ganks bottom, he shouldn't have to worry about his gank being countered by the enemy toplaner with teleport. Or an ADC and support diving the enemy team's ADC shouldn't have to worry about a midlane Diana with TP. I think this problem needs to be addressed ASAP.   
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally there are two smaller, but much more unhealthy, problems with TP right now.  
&gt;1). It lets weak laners start a camp at level 1, get 5 health pots and a doran's item, and TP back to lane at level 2 with an item and exp advantage. This really heavily punishes players who did not start a camp as now they are down EXP, items, and sustain.   
&gt;2). It basically is a get out of jail free card in lane, as if you take a bad trade, get ganked, or even die, you can TP right back to lane with little to no advantage lost.    
&gt;  
&gt;One of the most common proposed solutions is increasing teleports CD. This would certainly make teleport less attractive in general, but it does not actually fix any of the aforementioned problems. Teleport would still give laners too big of an advantage by doing a jungle camp/ getting a free out of jail card, and they'd still have almost as much global pressure.   
&gt;  
&gt;I have two ideas how to fix these problems:  
&gt;1). Make it so teleport literally is on cooldown until something like 10* minutes into the game; this would fix jungle camp starts, using TP to fix mistakes in lane, and the bigger issue of early game map pressure, while keeping TP's impact in the midgame/lategame.   
&gt;  
&gt;2). Alternatively, make it so TP is not usable until 4 minutes, then make it from 4-10* minutes only to towers, and from then on to everything else. This would remove jungle camp starts, but allow laners to teleport back to lane. Most importantly it would keep teleport users from ganking/counterganking lanes during the laning phase.

 **I have a dream that in season 5 Bruisers like Darius, Garen, Olaf, and Gangplank will be viable**

&gt;I have this dream that picking Garen top won't be considered useless or troll anymore.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a dream these bruisers won't forever be forced to be kited to oblivion and back but have a chance to get face to face with ADC's.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a dream where these types of Bruisers won't die in 4 auto attacks from ADC's late game.   
&gt;  
&gt;We will reach this dream one day or another in the form of these bruisers receiving fair judgement, whether or not I or any of you make it to the mountain top just remember, the future generation will make it!

 **@Riot what are your thoughts on Darius, Mordekaiser, and Fiora?**

&gt;People dont like playing against these champs, biggest offender being Mordekaiser in how incredibly unfun he is to play against. They all seem op to solo queue and are contested picks in LCS.  
&gt;  
&gt;People dislike Darius heal and bonus AD along with his True damage and wish for his heal to be removed or to increase his Q cooldown by a ton.  
&gt;  
&gt;People hate Mordekaisers exp passive and either want that removed to buff solo kaiser, or more popularly revert the rework all together.   
&gt;  
&gt;Fiora is disliked for %max health True damage out the ass along with her W avoiding everything except tower shots, along with her near 2 second cooldown Q late game if she hits an enemy. People want her damage toned down especially early/mid game in her True damage scaling or her ults damage early, along with her Q cooldown.  
&gt;  
&gt;What are your current thoughts on these guys so far? Any future plans besides current Darius and Fiora changes on pbe?

[ChRonICwar wrote on 2015-10-08 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cXiFwluA-possible-cs-counter):

 **"Possible" CS Counter**

&gt;I'm not sure if there are any technical challenges to this, but I would really love a feature that instead of just counting last hits, it counts possible last hits as well and shows the cs out of possible cs. Now, let me be clear about what I mean by "possible cs", cause having just the total creeps that died in the game wouldn't be helpful. The total "possible cs" would only count last hits you were in range for and weren't taken by any ally. This would allow us to do a couple things:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Most obviously, this would allow us to track how well we're last hitting. When we're practicing our last hitting in norms a game length often determines final cs far more than whether or not we missed those melees in the first three waves, so it's hard to tell if we've improved over the day. However, if we had a ratio to look at we could glance over our games for the day and see how much of an impact focusing on cs vs focusing on trading optimally helped us farm. (Also giving us a good metric of when we need to get off cause we're too tired to hit our mechanics.)  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Perhaps more subtly, this would encourage people to rotate properly even at lower leagues. Just like how having the cs brings the player focus at the end of the game back to how well they were farming despite whatever else happened, having a "possible cs" metric would be a good way to reflect on how well you were rotating throughout the game using your allies/enemies as a baseline. Even if you're netting 90+% of your cs, if your not around as much of it that can be more of a factor than anything. This could also serve as a more detailed XP tracker for the same reason instead of just relying on final level, which becomes more deceptive the later the game goes. Wanna practice milking that extra bit of XP during a lane swap? Look at how many "possible cs" you had more than you got. In that case the greater the discrepancy the better!  
&gt;  
&gt;3. We could actually have an easy metric for determining what lane you were. This facet could help both players and Riot. How you ask? Well have you ever gone Morgana jungle? I know I have. It's not good, but those Q ganks feel nice. Anyways, how does Riot know I went jungle if I used a non traditional champion for it? Well, the jungle item probably clues them in, but what about when top laners occasionally take smite? Well for them the teleport is usually a giveaway, but then we start getting into Summoner Spell meta, Hecarim jungle mains get in here, and then everything gets much more subjective. However, if we use all those signs combined with a more reliable stat, say a *very* high percentage of cs but a low total of "possible cs" then we might be able to get a more accurate idea of what role that person did. Also, this will make identifying supports very easy, who sometimes do strange build paths so might not be as easily traceable on items alone. (Also could destigmatize certain items. [Sightstone isn't just for supports junglers!]) But most importantly, this would give us *flexibility*. Sated junglers will look different than gank focused junglers. If kill lanes bot become a thing, or changes like double relic shield bot with Mord adc happen, this system will be able to account for all those changes. Even as the meta shifts the style of meta will always have certain tendencies with cs distribution given how that style optimizes gold/XP, and this stat will always allow us to properly track roles in any meta. (Of course, on the player side of things, being able to see this stat for comparison reasons whatever the meta would help. On Hecarim overall I go even, but when I have my jungle "possible cs" ratio I go positive and when I have my lane "possible cs" I go negative. Maybe I'll keep him in the jungle for now.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Enabling players to grow through tractable metrics is one of the ways I first got hooked on league, and has remained one of the best tools when I'm working on self improvement. While admittedly a much more abstract stat, I think this would be very helpful for people who are focused on trying to improve at some of the deeper aspects of the game without being so unintuitive as to overwhelm new players with another stat they don't understand since it's just a "/#" under a number they had to already deal with learning anyways. [In fact, this might make the CS *more* intuitive for newer players, as they can see it grow in game and the disparity change based on the actions they take.] Being stuck in a perpetual laning phase mindset is something I know a lot of people including myself struggle with, and this stat might help us break out of that and start to rotate or take jungle camps without thinking of why that's good outside of raising "possible cs" to a higher number.  
&gt;  
&gt;I could go on but I feel like I'm already rambling, and since this is my first post on a board I won't push it. I'm sure you can think of other reasons this would be helpful on your own, so post those in the comments below. :D Also I made a poll for if you think this is a good idea or not. Maybe if we get a lot of yes votes Riot will add this to the UI in an upcoming patch. [Dare to dream. d:]  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for reading all this. May your rotations be strong my fellow players!

 **Current state of the League kills comp variety**

&gt;Talking about (especially) competitive play.  
&gt;  
&gt;Right now, we mostly have **pick-, poke-, and teamfighting compositions**. In previous metas, teams also had the option to choose early,mid or lategame compositions. This aspect is nearly gone. There are a couple of problems in the current meta that causes this.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Earlygame leads are determined by map play.  
&gt;Generally this is a good thing. The smarter team that plays with better vision gets advantages without "outplaying" the oponnents individually. However this causes that the strength of champions early does not really matter. You don't need the best earlygamers when you 4 man dive someone.  
&gt;  
&gt;* The team with the better early game team can usually contest the **dragons** better, but as they are pretty senseless until we get into 4-5 range the other team **can give them up without getting punished**. In fact, it **might even be a benefit that they can use the time to bring important wards down** on the other side.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Another problem is that we simply** have too many champions that are good early AND scale really good into lategame**. Why take Katarina when there is a Lulu available? Veigar is another example. His lategame scaling is INSANE while they buffed him early so much you don't risk losing earlygame because of that.  
&gt;As an ADC player, it hurts to see that Corki is not played anymore. His early and migame is strong, but he doesn't scale well enough to be risked because you can't get an early advantage big enough to justify that pick.  
&gt;  
&gt;The easiest way to fix this is nerfing hardcore lategame carries early game and giving dragon it's gold value back so teams that take the risk of picking an early comp can get rewarded for it. Another thing would be to make turret diving easier again but then sololaners would have a really hard time in the current metagame.  
&gt;  
&gt;_TL;DR Teams generally pick lategame oriented comps because it is not worth to take the risk of an early comp. Effect is enhanced by too many lategame carries being too strong early._

&gt;I'm here to do the same thing but in a different way, since I can't really use ms paint very, I decided to make Riot a Fist bump in overlay form, since I'm asking for 23rp points so I can buy a summoner icon.

 **Misleading Splash Arts**

&gt;I'm tired of splash arts that are amazing as heck but in-game it looks NOWHERE near like it. It's an awesome skin concept but the model just destroys it. :(   
&gt;For example,Asylum Shaco  
&gt;(Asylum Shaco Splash Art has purplish shaggy hair that covers most of the upper face with 1 eye exposed and looks like an **_ACTUAL_** clown)  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/GFMvPLb.png  
&gt;(Asylum Shaco In-game Model has black-bluish hair and looks like a **_HUMAN BEING_**)  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/nre51Rh.png  
&gt;Now tell me how they look alike.  
&gt;(Masked Shaco has a more wilder blu-ish free hair with a bright orange mask)  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/pk8oWbg.png  
&gt;(Masked Shaco In-game Model has a very dark skin tone colored mask with a _**GREY**_ headband,in the splash art it's _**BLACK**_,and the hair looks like it's stuck together with tons of gel)  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/GOzwwaw.png  
&gt;  
&gt;All I'm asking is,can we get some sort of _**visual updates**_ for these skins that actually look like their splash arts? I mean look at the **Asylum Shaco**...

[MealReadytoEat wrote on 2015-10-11 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Yr6Fjyyc-fioras-new-lore-still-has-nothing-on-julie-daubigny-the-fencer-fiora-was-clearly-inspired-by):

 **Fiora's new lore still has nothing on Julie d'Aubigny, the fencer Fiora was clearly inspired by.**

&gt;For those who are unfamiliar, Julie d'Aubiny (She was better known under her stage name Mademoiselle Maupin) was a 17th century French dashing swordswoman and opera singer.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm real tempted to go on with a biography, but their is quite a few other resources out there, so I'll just give some highlights -   
&gt;  
&gt;* Like Fiora, d'Aubigny's father was an accomplished fencer, but unlike Fiora, her father encouraged her to take up fencing, training her in sword fighting (as well as reading and dancing) along the rest of the court pages of his lord, Count Louis de Lorraine-Guise,  the most powerful Man in France bar King Louis XIV.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* At 14, D'Aubigny became a mistress of Count Lorraine-Guise, who soon married her off to lesser noble. Shortly after the marriage, she fled with fencing master named S\u00e9rannes who was on the run for killing a man in an illegal duel.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* They made their living with fencing exhibitions and singing. D'Aubigny dressed as man, but didn't hide her gender; at least once when people questioned her gender in regard to her fencing skill, she ripped off her shirt.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* d'Aubigny left the S\u00e9rannes for for a young woman The girl's parent's did not approve, and they sent her off to a nunnery to keep d'Aubigny away.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* It didn't work. D'Aubigny followed her into the nunnery, took the body of recently deceased nun (who she didn't kill, I should add) into her room, then burned the place to the ground. Facing a death sentence, they ran off together, but ater a few months d'Aubigny got bored and returned her to her family.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* She got Count Louis de Lorraine-Guise to convince King Louis XIV to pardon her, then joined the Paris Opera, still at the age of 17. She became famous for her voice, witt, and many tempestuous relationships with fellow singers and various nobels of both genders.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* She continued to dress as a man outside of the opera, and jumped at every opportunity to duel. One noble she impaled in the shoulder; he apologized when he learned who she was, and they ended up lovers and life long friends. This was the only long lasting friendship she had.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* At a society ball, she stole the dance with the debutante (basically the prom queen) from her suitors, and kissed her in front of the entire crowd. Three of the suitors challenged her to a duel. They meet outside where she fought all three of them at once, and killed all three. Dueling in Paris was illegal, so she fled once again. (This is historically pretty fuzzy; she killed at least one of the three, however.)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* Through the influence of the King's brother, d'Aubigny got the King to pardon her once again. The king quipped the law specified men, not women, and that anyone foolish enough to duel her with her reputation deserved their fate anyhow.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* Back in Paris, she rejoined the opera to much acclaim. At this point, she was 24 and quite the celebrity, with many new opera's composed specifically around her talents. Her shenanigans outside the opera for around but she managed to stay out off trouble she couldn't buy off.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* At 29, she got in a setteled into a serious relationship with Madame la Marquise de Florensac, widely regardless as the most beautiful women in France, and amoung the richest and most influential. She continued to sing in the opera, but stopped causing too much trouble. Two years into their relationship, de Florensac got quite sick and died of a fever.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* From here the history is really sketchy. She was crushed; she quit the opera, and basically disappeared from the world, leaving little historical trace. Historians tend to agree she eventually winded up in a convent and died in 1707 (age 33), but some say she first went to her husband (Yea I forgot about him too) for a little while until he died too, and then went to the convent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Well that was a few more pointers than I originally intended. There's still quite a bit I missed, mostly regarding her various other lovers, but it should give you a feeling of how awesome Fiora's lore could have been. D'Aubigny was very much a romantic swashbuckler in the vein of Dumas, asides from her being real and female. I doubt the rampant bisexuality is appropriate for league's lore, but I'd absolutely love to see some references a burning nunnery, or at the very least, stabbing someone in the shoulder.

 **The story about the unbreakable bond between enemy laners**

&gt;I remember this one game, some time ago, that left a certain feeling within me once it was finished. It was a ranked game, that actually made me look at my enemy laner, my opponent, in a completely different way.  
&gt;  
&gt;It started out pretty normally, everyone started heading to their designated lanes, i was heading top (you know that lonely island all the way up there on the mini map), playing one of my mains that i really like. Now then, minions have spawned, and the enemy top was nowhere in sight .-. So i used this opportunity to have perfect focus on my cs, not one minion shall i miss, i encouraged myself. And... I missed the first one *sweat drop*   
&gt;  
&gt;Moving on. I kept farming and something didn't feel right.. He was still not showing up, and i just hit level 2. At first i was traumatised by my previous experiences, that he was going to come behind me with his jngler and first blood me, so i kept farming but being on my toes, and at some point my jngler was chasing the crug and i was that tripped out that i actually almost flashed away from the river when i saw someone moving there. Sigh.  
&gt;  
&gt;This continued untill i hit level 5, which brought me to the conclusion, that my lane opponent was afk. But, suddenly he teleported to top, as level 1 and started farming frantically. I could see he was keeping alot of distance, missing alot of cs, because of the fear i would all in him since we were 4 levels appart.  I could have went all in. I could have gotten first blood. But it would not be worth the feeling i would have afterwards. The feeling of feeling dirty.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus i wrote to him:  
&gt;Me: Hey listen, i won't poke you, i won't trade with you, untill you level up a bit, ok?  
&gt;Enemy top: ... Really?  
&gt;Me: Yes, so just farm up  
&gt;Enemy top: I think i will never understand why you would do this, but k, ty  
&gt;Me: There is more to this game than just winning  
&gt;Enemy top: If you say so  
&gt;  
&gt;**fast forward**  
&gt;  
&gt;The game was 40 mins in. We were about to have a fight at the baron pit. Both teams sizing up the other, faking moves throwing pokes. It was intense. And just as i was about to engage as the tank, our support disconnects... And just stops moving.. Right in front of the baron. My team frantically wrote in all chat "wait please" "he is afk please wait dont kill him", but alas. They gave us no such mercy. They bursted the support, killed our adc, one shotted our jngler, and mid and i managed to escape over the baron pit, just barely.  
&gt;  
&gt;As we were running through the jungle, enemy team trying to zone us, us hiding in every bush we could (fortunately they didnt go straight for baron, but chased us which gave time for our team to respawn and for us to buy additional time), we were almost homefree! But 2clicks from the base, the enemy top was there, literally standing right in front. Since we had barely 1/4 hp both, he could easily double kill us.   
&gt;  
&gt;But then.. He just..   
&gt;Passed us. And started recalling. It is easy to say mid and i were dumbfounded, as was his team who immediatly started capslocking him in all chat "OMG THIS GUY REPORT 9x" "WHY DO YOU DO THIS"   
&gt;  
&gt;To which he wrote  
&gt;  
&gt;**there is more to this game than just winning**  
&gt;  
&gt;Once everyone has respawned the fight resumed, it was close, it was tough, one call decided it all. But none of that really matters. What matters is, that once you aknowledge your lane opponent as your equal, as your opponent, just like ancient samurais did, ninjas, soldiers or whatever, i know it cannot compare to a game, but, whenever you face off with someone, there should be a code. A code of mutual respect.   
&gt;  
&gt;That day, both him and I realised, that the honorable opponent honor, doesn't only indicate a person who is humble in defeat and gracious in victory. It can be so much more.

 **New Zilean passive, Q feel and responsiveness tuning, rec item pages for each role**

&gt;It's time for time!  
&gt;  
&gt;Zilean's passive has been a weak point for a while now, and his Q had numerous little things that felt "off" about it. Those are past-tense sentiments. When the PBE updates, the new stuff will be in! This update is all about **visceral satisfaction**. The Q should feel better to use and the passive gives allies XP in a much more hands-on way. If any of you fine folks have the chance to check it out on the PBE, I'd love to hear what you think!  
&gt;  
&gt;For Time Bomb, we've updated the attach logic, tweaked the animation timing, given it a new attach particle, fixed a bug where it would appear to 'flicker' on landing, and generally made the way it interacts with the game world more consistent and satisfying. None of these changes by themselves are likely to stand out, but taken together they should improve the experience of using Time Bomb significantly.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the passive, it's new! Behold!   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt; **Time in a Bottle**  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt; Zilean stores time as Experience at a rate of X per 5 seconds.   
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt; When he has enough Experience to finish an ally's level, he can right-click them to impart it. Zilean receives as much Experience as he gives. Cannot be used in combat.  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;  
&gt;Does what it says on the tin. While the passive is off cooldown, Zilean sees indicators letting him know how much more XP he needs to finish someone's level; when he has enough, there's a line indicator to show him he can activate it. Hi-five a level into your buddies! Zilean gains the same XP as he gives and banks XP faster the higher level he is, so he wants to use it as often as he can. By being higher level mid lane he has slightly more XP to hand out, by being with an ADC bot lane he has persistent access to an ally. At level 18 Zilean no longer needs any XP for himself so the amount he gifts his allies effectively doubles.   
&gt;  
&gt;These changes help establish Zilean's identity, both thematically and in gameplay. Thematically, Zilean's typically had a lot of interesting and unique elements, but has fallen short of the epic power expressive of time magic. Some of his spells do reach that height--Chronoshift, the Time Bomb stun, and to a lesser extent the 99% value on Time Warp. By giving him direct, visceral control over one of the fundamental forces of the game, he solidifies the stature that befits him as a time mage.   
&gt;  
&gt;In gameplay, Zilean's support side excels against assassins/divers and in a protect the carry role; in this, he is typically overshadowed by Lulu, who shares his solo/bot switch capability and who can defend her ADC without the dps interruption that Chronoshift's revive brings. His utility mage side often overlaps with Orianna, a perennial generalist who can provide utility from a carry role and who also capitalizes on melee teammates. Between these two, Zilean's unique elements are his superior synergy with juggernauts via Time Warp, his amazing lategame control scaling, his massive zone control (compared to Lulu), and his mid-game roaming (compared to Orianna).   
&gt;  
&gt;Time in a Bottle gives him a capability that's totally unique in its own right and further accents the things that separate him from other champs. Juggernauts typically care about levels much more than ADCs and the passive rewards him for roaming. It won't solve all of Zilean's challenges, but it helps the time mage float in the right direction.    
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, we've added a rec item page for mid; players can toggle between the mid and support rec items by clicking the down arrow on the tab title. The mid page displays by default--generally, the newer players are the ones who use rec items and mid lane is a much more forgiving place to play the Zilsta.   
&gt;  
&gt;[Foxy grandpa indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DlK6UYv42c). All this stuff will be on the PBE soon, I'm especially eager to hear how the changes feel in live games!

 **LCS contract expiration dates**

&gt;Today I was looking through your lol esports website and I had a few questions about your player contract descriptions:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Why is there a tab for some (example Flarez) but there isn't even the option for others (example Bodydrop)  
&gt;  
&gt;2) Why does a player like Innox have his contract expire in 2014 even though he only started playing in the LCS in 2015, does this mean he was not under contract for the summer split?  
&gt;  
&gt;3) Why is this information available if its not updated, or even a feature for all LCS players? I understand that for some Challenger players this information could be harder to acquire, but how is it that all LCS players don't have this information disclosed (even on the same team there are discrepancies).  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your time.  
&gt;  
&gt;I submitted a ticket to Riot about this information and he told me to ask on the boards for another rioter who might have the answer to respond.  
&gt;Just seems a little odd the lack of uniformity surrounding this information.

&gt;Current plan is to do a mainly gameplay focused update, probably with some small visual changes, but certainly not a full VU. In terms of timing only thing I can say with confidence is that it won't be this year.

 **We need to stop asking for an "unattractive" female champion and this is why**

&gt;Riot was going down the right path when they made Reksai. They wanted to make a champion that is technically female, even though it could easily be retconned to a male with literally no effort, to pander to the people who think that every woman in League is an hourglass with tits.  
&gt;  
&gt;They just didn't want to do it in a way that would disgust people (like a witch or a hag, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;They made a female creature, not a woman that feels bad about looking in the mirror. Because no woman should have to feel that way, and Riot knows that.  
&gt;  
&gt;So just fucking stop asking for an "ugly" female champion already. You have no clue what you're trying to do. You've already gotten what you want with Reksai, and even more.  
&gt;  
&gt;So just stop.

 **For The People Who Designed Janna (Please bump for visibility)**

&gt;For the people who designed Janna,  
&gt;  
&gt;I just wanted to submit a support ticket to try and reach the person who designed Janna. Whoever you are, please know that you saved my life. As someone who has been battling anxiety and depression for the longest time, I have always been drawn to the solitude that video games can offer. I've always loved League of Legends, but the community can be a taaaaad toxic at times. I'm not going to lie and say I've never contributed to the vitriol myself, but around two years ago, it (along with a ton of personal life stuff) escalated to the point where I found it challenging to function within a 5 v 5 game environment. I resorted to spamming Coop v Ai games where I was given some artificial control over whether or not I could enjoy games. I just couldn't get up the confidence to play a real 5 v 5, and my main account slowly accrued upwards of 1600 Coop v Ai games. As I continued to battle severe depression, it felt like this game was the constant I could always rely on. I loved it. And I felt it was time try something new, so I started a smurf account through which I could gradually hone my mechanics, build confidence.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've always been a support player. There's something about helping prop up a teammate and outskilling an opponent with the least amount of gold possible that excites me. I'm drawn to peeling/skirmishing champions like Alistar, Nunu, Brand, and Gragas that dominate the zone control game by delicately balancing a thread between baits/initiates. Playing them in normal solo queue over the last couple weeks eventually led me to Janna, a champion that not only shines, but can turn the tide of the game through that skillset. It just felt right playing her, and I know it may seem silly or sappy or weird, but I just wanted to reach out and say thank you to the people who helped design her, however minute their contribution might have been. If it hadn't been for you, I don't think I'd ever have been able to say, "I played a game with 9 strangers today, and I wasn't scared."  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks.{{champion:40}}

 **Kindred - the Eternal Hunters - official sheet music**

&gt;Hi everyone!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm really excited to share with you the link for the Kindred sheet music: [http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/music/kindred/Kindred_the_Eternal_Hunters_official_sheet_music.zip](http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/music/kindred/Kindred_the_Eternal_Hunters_official_sheet_music.zip)  
&gt;  
&gt;Please don't hesitate to share this link on Reddit and YouTube, or direct people to this thread :)  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are a few things about the music people have asked me, and I thought I'd compile them here:  
&gt;  
&gt;"_What influenced the music for Kindred?_  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout the process, I was in touch with the writers and promo team to shape the music of the champion. The art my colleagues worked on was also a huge influence on the music. The theme you hear in the piece was the very first thing I wrote when I sat down to work on Kindred.   
&gt;  
&gt;_Why did you choose to use cello and piano?_  
&gt;  
&gt;I wanted to portray Lamb\u2019s agile and precise attributes, and Wolf\u2019s aggressive character. At the same time, both sides of Kindred are intertwined, and it only seemed appropriate to have them dance together and around each other!   
&gt;  
&gt;_Will there be more music similar to Kindred\u2019s coming from Riot in the future?_  
&gt;  
&gt;It\u2019s not impossible, but very unlikely. The Riot music team strives to come up with unique music for each one of our champions. The music has to encapsulate the art, the lore and the gameplay of the champion within a short track. If we did our job right, that means that music is so specific to each champ that it probably wouldn\u2019t fit another character!  
&gt;  
&gt;_What are all these sounds around the piano and cello performance?_  
&gt;  
&gt;These are actual recordings of blue magic! Powerful stuff."  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Please don't hesitate to ask any Kindred music-related question you'd like!  
&gt;  
&gt;Ed the Conqueror

 **Yorick-update**

&gt;Hey guys   
&gt;  
&gt;I was reading up on the coming {{champion:83}}-update when I thought to myself: why not think of a cool update myself?  
&gt;So I kind of looked up what Yorick is all about (since I dont really play him myself) and concluded that he's a minion summoning, grave digging juggernaut. (right?)  
&gt;  
&gt;From there, I got this whole kit that I thought would be cool for someone that answers that specific niche.  
&gt;So here's what I came up with ^_^  
&gt;  
&gt;({{item:2043}} **NOTE BEFORE YOU READ!!!** {{item:2043}}  I have absolutely no clue about numbers in skills, so **DO NOT MIND** the numbers, they could very easily be tweaked into a better, probably less OP, format.)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Passive** - _Army of Dread_  
&gt; For every minion or neutral monster killed, Yorick summons a ghoul for 10 seconds that attacks nearby enemies, prioritizing Yorick's target/champions  
&gt;_(These ghouls would have pretty weak stats, since there could be a LOT of them at once on the rift)_  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q** - _Dig'm Up_  
&gt; Yorick hits the ground with his shovel, opening three graves in a cone for 2 seconds, enemy champions stepping into them are marked as a target for his ghouls and recieve 200% dmg from them. The graves release 1 ghoul each for every champ stepping into one.  
&gt;_(Cone like {{champion:4}}-wildcard, ofcourse MUCH shorter, width would be  a little bigger and the graves would "just appear". If 1 champion would step into 1 grave, 3 ghouls would rise up from the graves (1 from each grave) so basically: get as many champs in the graves! )_  
&gt;  
&gt;**W** - _Soulmate_  
&gt; Yorick commands his ghouls to heal him instead of attacking targets for 5 seconds. They now fly between him and his target, dealing 50% of their usual dmg, but healing Yorick for the same amount.  
&gt;_(I'm guessing this is pretty clear)_  
&gt;  
&gt;**E** - _ForeverMore_  
&gt;_(passive)_ For every 20 minions/neutral monsters killed, Yorick's ghouls permanently gain 1 AD, 20 HP and last 0.2 seconds longer  
&gt;_(active)_ Each of Yorick's ghouls currently on the field split into two, halving their duration, but pumping up their AS by 40%  
&gt;_(Again pretty straightforward)_  
&gt;  
&gt;**R** - _LordoftheGraves_  
&gt; Yorick marks a large area where he wishes to build his cemetary for 5 seconds. During this time, enemy champions are slowed for (100% / amount of enemy champions in the zone)%. When the time's up, Yorick's ghouls will infest the enemies that remain in the area and deal 50% of their maximum health  as Physical dmg.  
&gt;(Notes on this ult:  
&gt;1. This basically means that if 1 champ is in the zone, he's rooted, if 2 champs are in the zone, they're slowed for 50%, 3 are slowed for 33%, 4 for 25% and 5 for 20%  
&gt;2. Since the enemy has a lot of time to leave the zone, I thought it would be somewhat fair to make the dmg real high. (yes, 50% max healt dmg is absurd, but hey, tweak away, boys!)  
&gt;3. This zone can be pretty large (say: {{champion:143}}-ult, maybe a little larger?) and I'm thinking more globalish (say: {{champion:223}}-ult range?))  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That's basically what I thought of. I know many of you will disagree with the FULL overhaul, but I thought this would be kind of cool anyway. Also: don't hate for not keeping his current ult, which is indeed really nice, but this one suited better with my general idea of him ^_^  
&gt;Would LOVE to hear your comments, just keep it nice, ok?

 **A note about The Harrowing**

&gt;Hey everyone,  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re making a few changes around how we roll out seasonal events, story, and featured game modes. As you know, in past seasonal events we\u2019ve released content together (i.e. the Harrowing or Snowdown). Going forward, we\u2019re going to be switching that up a bit and releasing those different types of content separately \u2014 like you\u2019ve probably seen on PBE with One For All, Zombie / Slayer skins, and the Shadow Isles champion bios. All of this means seasonal events like the Harrowing and Snowdown will roll out differently than you\u2019ve seen them in the past. This lets us kick out cool stuff more often without being constrained by specific times of year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As always, let us know what you think about these changes in the comments below. We\u2019re stoked to hear what you think.

&gt;Hey guys,  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasn't a decision that was made lightly.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mordekaiser had a lot going on with his thematic (he's a mage! He's in heavy armor! He's the first of the Undead! He can steal his enemy's souls! He's Magneto!).   
&gt;  
&gt;Now while all of that is pretty cool, we felt that having so much going on made him a little bit confused as a character.  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking at him more closely, it was the metal-mage stuff that didn't really seem to fit cohesively with everything else, or fit his background. Also, we made a move away from the metal-mage aspect in his visual effects recently, and as such, his "Master of Metal" title just didn't really seem to fit so well any more. We kept the metal references in his spells, though (which, as a metal fan myself, makes me happy).  
&gt;  
&gt;In his longer bio (which will be released soon!) we've delved a little into who Mordekaiser was before he became the undying revenent we all know and love. Having explored his background a little more than we have previously, we figured the "Lord of Death" was a pretty fitting title for him.   
&gt;  
&gt;Hope that gives a little insight into this change!  
&gt;  
&gt;Cheers!

&gt;&gt; Hey Ghostcrawler! I first heard about you on your work on the TForce Podcast, I think its awesome that you put yourself out there for the community!   
&gt;  
&gt;Shout out to my friends on Trinity Force!  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt; Warning here this will be a bit of a rant so sorry in advance. I've been playing since S2 and back then the champs were pretty simple. Someone like Malphite was really simple and most people could play him no problem whatsoever. Now with the champions coming out of recent we are seeing kits that are more complex than I could have anticipated. Not to mention every ability having a passive. Holy Batman. Now I'm not saying that complex to play champs are bad, but it does hamper the expirence of new to MOBA players (like I was when I started League).  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt; About the passives, it seems that almost every champ that has been released since S5 has had an ability with a passive on it (exeption off the top of my head being baum). If we look at someone like Tahm who has a passive on his e and r as well as his aquired taste passive, is really strong and its another thing to keep in mind when in lane. Whereas someone like WW has no passives on his abilities, suffers because of it, not to mention if you are keeping track of CD's in your head you only have to worry about 3 instead of Tahm when you have to worry about 5-6.  
&gt;  
&gt;We feel overall that the ramp up in complexity on champs (the extra passives and double passives and so on) isn't a great trend to stay on. It's a challenge when you're in the trenches, because you want players to get excited about each new champ that's released, so we keep trying to outdo ourselves. If we released [next champ] with Vlad's Q, I think we'd all be disappointed. But that's the short term view, and in the long term view, we don't want to end up at a point where champs have 4 passives and 20 abilities and so on.

 **Looking for 2-3 others to start a LoL community with - details/vision inside**

&gt;Hello LoL players,  
&gt;  
&gt;I am looking to start a LoL community that is targeted around gold and above players with ages around 18-28ish.  I have been searching for a specific type of LoL community, but the ones I have found do not seem to be very active or have the community feel. With the social features (such as clubs) and the coming of dynamic queue in ranked, it is potentially the best time to start community creation! **Please read/skim through everything**  
&gt;  
&gt;**My History/About Me:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I founded and led a LoL community, GLHFGG, in 2013 for quite some time. I wanted a place where people could have enjoyable games without trolls or ragers. http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3061350 is an example of one of our past threads (a very brief version/not the original). Additionally, I used to host monthly prized (from Riot) tournaments which were all shoutcasted/streamed such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC0vpb3R4tk . The community was widely successful, and everyone was super excited about the monthly tournaments. On tournament day, we would have upwards of 150-160 in our chat channel. On average, we would have around 65 in the chat channel throughout the day. They were not just in the chat channel either, they would actually talk and join each other for games. Eventually, I became burnt out as I was the only one in charge of the community, and I took some time off from LoL. The community slowly dwindled away to its death. I've led fairly successful guilds in many games and other communities such as a SC2 community (composed of quite a few diamonds/masters some of which went on to become GM).  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, I'm a 20 year old college student who recently just finished his finals and is on break. This is my 4th year as an accounting student, and I have held multiple leadership positions in college. Outside of college and LoL, I enjoy Ping Pong, Basketball, Racquetball, Star Wars (got tickets to opening night!!!), foosball, and more. Other questions you have, you may ask about me. I just wanted to give you a brief glimpse of myself.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Some of my ideas:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm really looking to create a medium size community between around 50 in chat consistently. I want to focus on primarily the age range of 18-26 and ideally gold+. There are plenty of communities for teaching the basics, but not many for higher ELOs. The focus of the community should be on improvement and fun. For example, our mission statement could be something like(SAMPLE THIS ONE JUST CONVEYS A GENERAL MESSAGE): Our mission is to provide a fun, enjoyable community in which players of similar skill level and age can socialize, relax, and improve together.  **Constructive** criticism would also be encouraged for the purpose of improvement. Some possible community event/ideas:  
&gt;  
&gt;-Inhouses Various custom game modes and such as: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2qlx0h/ever_been_bored_of_playing_normalranked_lol_games/  
&gt;  
&gt;-Some sort of 5s league/scrimmage night and perhaps a bimonthly tournament with RP prizes.  
&gt;  
&gt;-Topic Discussion/Analysis day where we analyze professional gameplay and others are able to ask questions. (Someone could stream off twitch, and a few people could break down the video and answer any questions and allow for other feedback on what else.)  
&gt;  
&gt;-Group LCS watching on voice comms  
&gt;  
&gt;-Dynamic Queue: This is a HUGE thing I want to focus on. With the upcoming ranked season, people should be able to find similarly skilled players to queue up with.  
&gt;  
&gt;-I'd love to hear any of your ideas.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The type of person I'm looking for to help me lead:**  
&gt;-Active,18+, and at least Gold. Self-explanatory  
&gt;-Creative/Innovative and ability to analyze potential ideas. I want us to be able to brainstorm together and look for strengths and potential weaknesses of certain ideas.  
&gt;-Laid-back possibly a bit trollzy. Additionally, peacemaker is a huge plus. Our jobs will include keeping the peace in the community and responding in a mature fashion. At times, it may also be necessary to correct people in a calm, light manner (Hey XXX player, I know that last game was rough, but can you please try to tone down the raging at randoms).

 **[SUGGESTION] A New Ping Option to Identify Enemy Champions by Their Roles.**

&gt;Communication of opponent champions' locations is one of the most crucial parts of the gameplay.  
&gt;During the laning phase, you can warn allies of possible ganks and countergank opportunities.  
&gt;Post laning phase, knowledge of enemy misposition can often lead to a favorable teamfight or objectives (barron, dragon, towers...etc).  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, our ping system has one ping that can accommodate for all the instances a ping can be used to signal enemy positions: the warning sign (or the general all purpose blue ping). Usually, after a warning ping, the player has to type in chat what the warning is for, or just trust that his/her allies will become very passive until they identify it as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**I would like to propose a new type of ping, where you can specify the enemy champion's role.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With this ping, you will be able to select the role (top, mid, adc, supp, jg) of the enemy champion you saw.  
&gt;For example, if you see the enemy jg passing by one of the deep wards you placed, you will be able to use this ping to specifically pinpoint the enemy jg's position to your allies.   
&gt;This will cut out the need to take time to type in chat while enhancing the degree of information you can provide to your allies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, in settings where you are communicating over voice chat with your teammates, the value of this ping diminishes.  
&gt;However, I would like to point out that in vast majority of the games (soloQ and duoQ), you will not be connected over voice with all 4 other members of your team.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is immense potential of what this ping can bring to the gameplay, by allowing teams to communicate more efficiently and accurately.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please upvote if you would like to see this ping in game, or leave comments if you have suggestions / ideas.

 **Can we talk about how bad the Skarner rework is?**

&gt;http://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Skarner_0.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;Before his rework, I fancied myself a regular player of Skarner, I loved being a sticky, dangerous bug of fear that caught people out of position and dragged them away to their doom, I also felt very sure of myself playing him and did very well most of the time. Ever since his rework though, I played him a few times and have now completely dropped him from my roster of played champs because he\u2019s no longer good at what I played him for and the kit he has now is incredibly boring.  
&gt;  
&gt;Riot stated with the Juggernaut rework that they \u201cwanted Skarner to have something truly unique to him\u201d when he\u2019s unable to use his ultimate to kidnap someone. Their solution was to give him the six crystals that are placed on the map when he\u2019s on a team, they said that \u201cwith these changes, Skarner becomes a neutral objective control king, and super useful for teams looking to overcome their enemies with buff and map control.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not what happened. While Skarner received a huge boost in popularity and was seen as being OP, no one picked him or thought he was OP because of his ability to control objectives, it was because he was a tanky unkillable monster that you couldn\u2019t keep from barreling through your team and killing everyone in sight.   
&gt;  
&gt;I\u2019ve said before in many threads but the Skarner rework goes against an oft quoted design philosophy of Riot which is that they do not like ball of stats champions and regret the ones that are in the game that came about from earlier years. Skarner is currently nothing but a ball of stats champion who\u2019s passive is to give him more stats when fighting in specific areas. And this was even something that is the exact opposite of what they were trying to achieve. They said that they felt Skarner, as he was before the rework, was just a generic bruiser that never had a real reason to pick him over someone else but that\u2019s what he\u2019s been turned into, ever since his nerfs I barely ever see Skarner picked at all in ranked or normals because, since his stats no longer make him OP there\u2019s no reason to pick him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, the goal of the rework, to make him a neutral objective controller is impossible to do without completely changing his kit, because his kit is not designed for controlling objectives, nothing in his kit rewards him for, or encourages him to fight for objectives aside from getting a stat boost from his crystals. His Q is a short range spammable damage ability, the kind of thing someone who gets up in an enemy\u2019s face would use to give out long term dps, his w is a speed boost for catching people that also has a shield to help him survive being in the middle of an enemy team or taking the damage from someone trying to kite him, his E is meant to allow him or a teammate to close the gap and pounce on someone and his ult is a kidnapping tool. None of these abilities are things that a neutral objective controller would want in their kit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Know who DOES have a kit for objective control? Nunu. Nunu has two abilities for controlling things in the jungle, he has his consume for dealing large True damage to monsters to secure them for himself or his team and he has his ult which is great in the jungle and river because of the confined aspect of those places and that fact that he can catch people by surprise with his ult by hiding behind a corner or in a bush to channel for a lot of damage before the enemy realizes it or when they have no choice but to fight in it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But do you know what Skarner\u2019s kit IS good for? What he is SUPPOSED to do? Being a champion that catches someone and then sticks to them and doesn\u2019t let up until they\u2019re destroyed by himself or his team. His previous kit was perfect for this kind of gameplay, with the crystal venom passive, w to move in quick, E to slow someone down, and then Q Q Q to stun them and finish them off or Ult and drag them away into your team.   
&gt;  
&gt;Further, that kit was satisfying. It was satisfying and felt rewarding to get that third hit in just before the person got to their turret so that they got stunned long enough for you and your ally to finish them off. There was a direct goal for you to focus on someone in a fight so that you could stun them either to peel for a teammate or to single out a priority target.   
&gt;  
&gt;Does anyone actually feel any kind of satisfaction from taking a crystal and fighting in it? Where is the decision making in fighting over the crystals? No one ever thinks, \u201cOh no, if we fight here Skarner will be in his crystals, maybe we should try to fight somewhere else.\u201d Because outside of the pro scene, and even in it, fights aren\u2019t something that usually happens because of some kind of war game where you try to take certain objectives over others. Fights happen because of people unexpectedly running into each other, or because you need to either gain or prevent the gaining of a neutral objective. If the enemy team is trying to take Baron, them having Skarner on their team doesn\u2019t factor into whether you fight for it or not, you\u2019ll react to it the same way you would if they didn\u2019t have Skarner on their team.   
&gt;  
&gt;The crystals also don\u2019t actually change anything about whether you can take the enemy or not. Whether Skarner gets a boost from his passive is determined on which team holds the stronger position in the game when a fight occurs near them. If Skarner is fed then the enemy team will avoid his crystals, if he\u2019s behind then the enemy will take it from him without him being able to fight for it, and if the teams are even then it gives him a slight boost to his stats but it only effects him and so his team and the enemy team will just fight like the crystal wasn\u2019t there regardless of who has control of it because whoever wins the fight is determined by positioning, split second decisions, someone being caught out, or people being grouped up too much for a wombo combo, not because Skarner had.  
&gt;  
&gt;The entire problem with the crystals is that they offer no strategic use or planning. The mana regen component only matters when Skarner is farming the jungle, the attack speed component only matters if Skarner is a damage threat on the enemy team which is decided by whether or not he\u2019s ahead or not, and the movespeed bonus mostly matters when farming for movement through the jungle and when its used for teamfights it\u2019s usefulness is again decided by how well or poorly Skarner is already doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;tl;dr  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel I\u2019m starting to ramble a bit so I\u2019ll try to sum up and get to the point. Skarner\u2019s rework is terrible. I love Repertoire for what he did on the forums a couple months back but the rework he created and the intention behind it is incredibly half-assed in its attempts to change Skarner\u2019s niche. All it\u2019s done is made Skarner like he was with his first rework where he\u2019s functional, but unsatisfying to use and offers nothing interesting to his team aside from his ult. His ganks are also back to how they were then with whether the gank succeeds or not depending on whether he lands he E or whether his ally laner has enough CC to lock the enemy down for him to smack around. Further, all his current passive did was take away a lot of his base stats to give him more stats when within the area of his crystals and them being a factor for neutral objective control at all is because of where they\u2019re placed, place them in front of turrets or in the middle of a lane and you immediately change what his supposed niche is focused around. It is a terribly artificial way to give someone a niche and it doesn\u2019t even work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Riot is going to someday come back and rework Skarner yet again, because eventually they\u2019ll realize all these issues with the kit he has now and I can only hope that when they do they turn him back into the sticky inescapable scorpion again but if not then I hope they at least completely change his abilities so he can actually BE a neutral objective controller instead of a generic ball of stats.

 **The State of Marksmen and the Rework Explained, part 2 (Why this Rework isn't it, Yet)**

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;_In [part 1 of this post, Why they Need a Rework,](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) I detailed the current state of marksmen, and why they are in that state. While this post more or less stands alone, it will make far more sense after reading the first part._  
&gt;  
&gt;My first post made 5 main points :  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives   
&gt;2.  Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor  
&gt;3.  Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + support is the ideal duo lane.  
&gt;4.  Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity  
&gt;5.  All of these detract from making Marksmen fun  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm going to address how each of these is, and could be, addressed in the Marksmen rework.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives._ - This is mostly about towers and inhibitors. Currently, Marksmen are the only class that can take defended towers, especially when good waveclear makes it too risky for melee champs to attack them. The rework address this in two ways - They increased the AP ratio on auto attacks against structures from .4 to .5, and they shifted Marksman itemization away from AD and AS into crit, effectively making them slightly worse against towers. They also slightly more than doubled tower HP while removing their armor and MR. This change makes the Armor and MR they get while no minions are present more significant (if anything a buff to marksmen), but as pen never worked against towers is otherwise completely agnostic - numbers are bigger, but the same % of their hp. I guess it's a nerf to Janna.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, these are good changes, but the extra utility and defenses marksmen items now gives will make defensive options less necessary on marksmen, so in the end I think they will end up taking towers as fast or faster. The removal of armor from towers should have happened a long time ago - when something always has the same effective health, it might as well have that as its actual health. Damage against towers is now much clearer - either 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. It still punishes hybrid champs, as it only takes into account the higher of 1/2 of your AP, or your bonus AD.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's two other thing I'd like to see to  address the monopoly of Marksmen on tower siege; Ohmwrecker becoming  a real item for sieging towers, oriented towards mid to late game 5 man dives under towers defended with ranged waveclear rather than "that item that junglers rush to dive towers early game", and another AP item with strong function against towers. Nashor's would be a good candidate.  
&gt;__________________________________________________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor_ - HP can be purchased without seriously harming a champions offensive budget; RoA, Rylai's, Black Cleaver, Mallet, etc, while offensive armor items are left to Zhonya's, and to a lesser extent Sunfire Cape. HP alone is enough to survive the burst of assassin, or CD gated combo from most bruiser and fighters, yet the high sustained damage of marksmen forced large chunks of the champion pool to build some form of armor. This in turn enabled magic damage based champions to remain effective, especially against champions with a large defense budget (tanks).  
&gt;  
&gt;Juggernauts, including the likes of Olaf, have actually addressed this fairly well.  Melee carries can't typically fill this role, as squishy melees have much greater vulnerability and lower reliability. Coordination and CC is much more valid against a melee than a ranged back liner.  Juggernauts, on the other hand, can survive a reasonable level of CC and focus, while still putting out enough DPS that health stacking can't negate them. Mordkaiser simply works in reverse - he forces the building of MR, as he has high sustained damage and % hp magic damage, enabling AD burst on his team to function.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some improvements to DPS options for AD assassins and bruisers would help, but the items changes on PBE accomplish this to some extent. Ghostblade will be a much better option for bruisers, while crit builds with a bit of AS will be better for assassins, thanks to two high AD items, as well as trinity force, offering 20% crit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Among all the issues with marksmen, this is the one Riot has been doing the best at address. Things aren't perfect, but since 5.16 this alone no longer necessitates marksmen in a team comp.  
&gt;_____  
&gt;_Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + Support is the ideal duo lane._ - This the elephant in the room for the marksmen rework. Marksmen have been given the variety and versatility needed to play outside of bot lane, while nothing has been done to make them less optimal in the duo lane. In fact, they've had their scaling per level reduced even further while their level 1 AD was buffed, making XP even less of an issue. I threw out some idea's on how to fix this[ here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carryhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carry)  
&gt;Relic shield give 2 gp 10 on the pbe, which makes it a slightly better option for carries bot lane, but ultimately it's nearly as good for marksmen as it is melees. Mordekaiser has a gimmick on his W to get around this, but that's a gimmick, not a systematic or itemization change that would result in real variety. It just got nerfed, and the item changes screw him pretty hard anyway.   
&gt;  
&gt;Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes when they are overpowered enough that teams can't successfully pick or itemize against multiple marksmen, even after the opportunity cost of what they replaced is paid.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity_ - The rework's on PBE makes ADC's far more diverse and fun to play. Going on these one by one is going to be my next post in this series, but by and large they now have enjoyable game play and diversity. There's now multiple build paths available to each marksmen, and noticeably different builds between marksmen, due to multiple items that give noticeable defenses while still being quite offensive, and good CDR options.   
&gt;  
&gt;Riot did a fairly good job addressing the monotony of playing ADC's, and the homogeneity between them, without addressing the systematic changes that resulted in them being balanced into the state they are in in the first place.  
&gt;___________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_All of these detract from making Marksmen fun_ - If I were to give a number, I'd say that riot has dealt with half the balancing issue that have resulted in Marksmen being unfun to play in the first place. They then made them fun, without regard to the remaining balance issues holding them back on live. This is an early iteration of the PBE; I still have high hopes they will begin to address the remaining issue soon. Otherwise, expect a minimum of 4 marksmen a game.  
&gt;  
&gt;_Part 3 is going to be feedback and analysis of the current champions, items, and game changes on PBE right now, rather than any systematic explanation of the game or the meta._  
&gt;  
&gt;_Please leave feedback, I'll try to address any questions._  
&gt;

 **Vayne rework concept (Very unlikely, but still fun)**

&gt;Possible Vayne rework: {{champion:67}}   
&gt;  
&gt;Vayne, the (True) Purifier  
&gt;  
&gt;Passive:  
&gt;Vayne taints her bolts with the blood of her enemies, dealing 2% increased damage for every enemy champion in a 1000 range around her.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Q: Tumble Mana: 30  
&gt;CD 4/3.5/3/2.5/2  Cooldown starts upon activation  
&gt;Vayne tumbles, firing a bolt at the nearest enemy champion, range 450, dealing 110/115/120/125/130% of her AD as physical damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;W: Purifying Focus  
&gt;Passive  
&gt;Every time Vayne attacks a singular target without swapping targets, her damage is increased against that target by 2% per auto attack. This passive applies to all targets she attacks, but is removed against the last target once she swaps.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: Condemn  
&gt;CD 20/18/16/14/12 Mana: 90  
&gt;Vayne fires a heavy bolt at the heart of an enemy, stunning them if they are within 300 range of her, and slowing them for 50% for 1 second otherwise, dealing 70% of her AD as physical damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Final Hour  
&gt;CD 100/85/70 Mana: 90 (This is new Vayne's balancing point)   
&gt;Vayne gains 30/60/90 Attack Damage, 50% Attack Speed, 30/60/90 movement speed, and her attack speed cap is removed for 15 seconds. Her auto attacks CANNOT crit during the duration of Final Hour.  
&gt;During this time, all of Vayne's damage from all sources is halved, but is all converted to **True Damage**  
&gt;  
&gt;New Vayne's purpose is purely to obliterate tanks and juggernauts alike.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tell me whether or not you like this rework, as it removes the max health True damage, but adds that ult. There is supposed to be a fourth poll option : No, too much True damage.

 **Idea to Add more to Caitlyn's Identity**

&gt;I think Caitlyn's Ultimate "Ace in the Hole" should fire through targets if they are killed by the bullet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ex. Low health Soraka and a Low health Ez. Caitlyn locks in on Ez, but Soraka walks in the way to block the bullet. The bullet should fire through Soraka and still kill Ez.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think a change like this would really add to Caitlyn's identity as a sniper.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: Of course the bullet should scale down in damage with each champion it passes through.

 **The State of Marksmen and the Rework Explained, part 2 (Why this Rework isn't it, Yet)**

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;_In [part 1 of this post, Why they Need a Rework,](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) I detailed the current state of marksmen, and why they are in that state. While this post more or less stands alone, it will make far more sense after reading the first part._  
&gt;  
&gt;My first post made 5 main points :  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives   
&gt;2.  Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor  
&gt;3.  Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + support is the ideal duo lane.  
&gt;4.  Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity  
&gt;5.  All of these detract from making Marksmen fun  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm going to address how each of these is, and could be, addressed in the Marksmen rework.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives._ - This is mostly about towers and inhibitors. Currently, Marksmen are the only class that can take defended towers, especially when good waveclear makes it too risky for melee champs to attack them. The rework address this in two ways - They increased the AP ratio on auto attacks against structures from .4 to .5, and they shifted Marksman itemization away from AD and AS into crit, effectively making them slightly worse against towers. They also slightly more than doubled tower HP while removing their armor and MR. This change makes the Armor and MR they get while no minions are present more significant (if anything a buff to marksmen), but as pen never worked against towers is otherwise completely agnostic - numbers are bigger, but the same % of their hp. I guess it's a nerf to Janna.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, these are good changes, but the extra utility and defenses marksmen items now gives will make defensive options less necessary on marksmen, so in the end I think they will end up taking towers as fast or faster. The removal of armor from towers should have happened a long time ago - when something always has the same effective health, it might as well have that as its actual health. Damage against towers is now much clearer - either 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. It still punishes hybrid champs, as it only takes into account the higher of 1/2 of your AP, or your bonus AD.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's two other thing I'd like to see to  address the monopoly of Marksmen on tower siege; Ohmwrecker becoming  a real item for sieging towers, oriented towards mid to late game 5 man dives under towers defended with ranged waveclear rather than "that item that junglers rush to dive towers early game", and another AP item with strong function against towers. Nashor's would be a good candidate.  
&gt;__________________________________________________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor_ - HP can be purchased without seriously harming a champions offensive budget; RoA, Rylai's, Black Cleaver, Mallet, etc, while offensive armor items are left to Zhonya's, and to a lesser extent Sunfire Cape. HP alone is enough to survive the burst of assassin, or CD gated combo from most bruiser and fighters, yet the high sustained damage of marksmen forced large chunks of the champion pool to build some form of armor. This in turn enabled magic damage based champions to remain effective, especially against champions with a large defense budget (tanks).  
&gt;  
&gt;Juggernauts, including the likes of Olaf, have actually addressed this fairly well.  Melee carries can't typically fill this role, as squishy melees have much greater vulnerability and lower reliability. Coordination and CC is much more valid against a melee than a ranged back liner.  Juggernauts, on the other hand, can survive a reasonable level of CC and focus, while still putting out enough DPS that health stacking can't negate them. Mordkaiser simply works in reverse - he forces the building of MR, as he has high sustained damage and % hp magic damage, enabling AD burst on his team to function.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some improvements to DPS options for AD assassins and bruisers would help, but the items changes on PBE accomplish this to some extent. Ghostblade will be a much better option for bruisers, while crit builds with a bit of AS will be better for assassins, thanks to two high AD items, as well as trinity force, offering 20% crit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Among all the issues with marksmen, this is the one Riot has been doing the best at address. Things aren't perfect, but since 5.16 this alone no longer necessitates marksmen in a team comp.  
&gt;_____  
&gt;_Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + Support is the ideal duo lane._ - This the elephant in the room for the marksmen rework. Marksmen have been given the variety and versatility needed to play outside of bot lane, while nothing has been done to make them less optimal in the duo lane. In fact, they've had their scaling per level reduced even further while their level 1 AD was buffed, making XP even less of an issue. I threw out some idea's on how to fix this[ here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carryhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carry)  
&gt;Relic shield give 2 gp 10 on the pbe, which makes it a slightly better option for carries bot lane, but ultimately it's nearly as good for marksmen as it is melees. Mordekaiser has a gimmick on his W to get around this, but that's a gimmick, not a systematic or itemization change that would result in real variety. It just got nerfed, and the item changes screw him pretty hard anyway.   
&gt;  
&gt;Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes when they are overpowered enough that teams can't successfully pick or itemize against multiple marksmen, even after the opportunity cost of what they replaced is paid.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity_ - The rework's on PBE makes ADC's far more diverse and fun to play. Going on these one by one is going to be my next post in this series, but by and large they now have enjoyable game play and diversity. There's now multiple build paths available to each marksmen, and noticeably different builds between marksmen, due to multiple items that give noticeable defenses while still being quite offensive, and good CDR options.   
&gt;  
&gt;Riot did a fairly good job addressing the monotony of playing ADC's, and the homogeneity between them, without addressing the systematic changes that resulted in them being balanced into the state they are in in the first place.  
&gt;___________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_All of these detract from making Marksmen fun_ - If I were to give a number, I'd say that riot has dealt with half the balancing issue that have resulted in Marksmen being unfun to play in the first place. They then made them fun, without regard to the remaining balance issues holding them back on live. This is an early iteration of the PBE; I still have high hopes they will begin to address the remaining issue soon. Otherwise, expect a minimum of 4 marksmen a game.  
&gt;  
&gt;_Part 3 is going to be feedback and analysis of the current champions, items, and game changes on PBE right now, rather than any systematic explanation of the game or the meta._  
&gt;  
&gt;_Please leave feedback, I'll try to address any questions._  
&gt;

&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; What about legacy harrowing/Halloween skins ? Are they coming back?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know how this is to be handled, however my thoughts on this would be they will be treated as normal legacy skins (don't quote me on this, as I'm purely speculating here).  
&gt;  
&gt;With Harrowing being decoupled from Hallowe'en, I expect this would result in these skins becoming available at different times in the year - not this one time of the year. This may coincide with the "not-hallowe'en harrowing", or it may be entirely random like a lot of the other legacy skins.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, purely my speculation!

[and Valor wrote on 2015-10-30 UTC](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/PE1LJTOM-quinn-pbe-feedback-thread?sort_type=best&amp;comment=00420000):

&gt;I just finished playing some of the new Quinn on PBE, so I figured I'd drop my feedback here.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's pretty obvious at this point that these huge amount of changes left a lot of us emotionally charged. That said, some arguments for both sides are valid. Since most of vocal people in this thread are against the changes, I'll start with what was enjoyable about the new Quinn.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Positives of the New Quinn**  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the most surprising things about playing the new Quinn was how much her strengths have changed. Before the rework, Quinn and Valor were extremely different from other ADCs: Quinn had a strong early game, not only for an adc but as a champion in general (given her E, massive harrier damage, and blind), had qualities of other roles (assassination and split-push potential with ult, dueling potential with blind), and lacked qualities of traditional ADCs (steered away from the typical early-game punching bag to late-game, team-fighting, dps machine power curve).  
&gt;  
&gt;The Quinn rework fixes this alleged "identity crisis" by successfully molding Quinn and Valor into a more stereotypical ad carry. The scaling on her passive, CD refund and execution damage on Q, and removal of Valor as a fighting utility _shifts Quinn into a clearly defined role: a roaming ranged carry,_ which is exactly Riot appears to have set out to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon testing, I noticed her passive becomes vitally significant in the late game especially. Harrier does decent amounts of damage (still obviously less than it used to), but given that her Q applies her passive, she can proc it several times in a row, leading to massive amounts of dps. Quinn still retains most of her ability to chase down targets, but now has a greater emphasis on wearing down targets with multiple autos in quick succession rather than huge burst. Her changes to her passive and Q create a nice and new feeling to Quinn's late game. If I were to try to describe it in words, she just flows so much more now, and everything feels very smooth.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes create a power curve for Quinn similar to other ADCs in that she is generally weak early game with Q and harrier doing little damage, but by late game (especially with a lead) her constant passive procs and Qs equate to a load of damage and plays like most other AD Carries.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rework is bearable and actually pretty fun to play, but has it's own problems as shown below.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So What's Wrong with the New Quinn?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's start from the view of the Quinn mains, or more accurately, _the Quinn **and Valor** mains._  
&gt;  
&gt;Back before Quinn was fully released, when IronStylus was asked about how "satisfying" Quinn's auto's are, he [replied](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3097136&amp;page=201#post34571759):  
&gt;  
&gt;"I find her auto attacks EXTREMELY satisfying. Some of that is animations and VFX, other parts of it are sound, crisp and snappy, and the other part, the novel part, is the special sauce that's a cornerstone of her auto attacks."  
&gt;  
&gt;As a Quinn and Valor main, I couldn't agree more. Not only do Quinn's autos have a "crisp and snappy" feel, but most of her kit does on live right now. The sharp sound of a crit or proc-ing harrier, the snap-back sound effect of her E, and her Q all have a feel similar to paper or a wing being flapped sharply in the air. Add on a shiv-proc or Skystrike, and you have an attack that not only feels strong and sharp, but has the damage to back it up.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is where the problems start with the "new Quinn." There's something inherently satisfying about extending and finally proc-ing harrier and watching your target's health get nuked by a strong auto, similar to the sound of Vayne's W. That upfront damage feeling makes harrier "feel" important, so when Valor marks your next target, it really prompts you to extend for it, leading to meaningful decision-making. Unfortunately, this feeling is something that _the new Quinn rework lacks._ Both harrier and Quinn's Q fail to provide any significant damage when trading in lane, leading to a very wishy-washy and weak feeling. In fact, this Quinn feels similar to Talon right now in that until at least mid-game, you feel _useless._ It isn't until late game that your Q damage makes using the CD refund actually feel worth it (clearing with Q in lane just leads to Quinn being oom), and harrier starts really hurting. Even then though, harrier's damage doesn't seem to compare with how it does per hit on live right now, which makes sense. This unfortunately has the affect of making Quinn's gameplay feel too stoic and smooth compared to her sharp, bursty feel on live right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;This, combined with a lack of Skystrike damage and diving potential that ult used to provide, makes playing Quinn pretty _boring_ by contrast, and dreadfully so in the early-to-mid game. You're not really doing anything but trying to last hit and avoid trading for at least the first 10 minutes of the game, and having an ult that doesn't deal damage isn't helpful at all. Removing the blind from Q also removes the necessary protection Quinn needs to safely engage and disengage in trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quinn also still suffers from terrible range for an ADC, resulting in very sub-par team-fighting, in which to proc any of your marks you must overextend, often leading to your death. Your main focus switches to isolating targets and wittling them down before you finish them off with Q, again a very gradual process lacking any crisp feeling until the execution with Q. This gradual feeling may just be common between ADCs, but that doesn't change that Quinn used to have a more enjoyable play-pattern.  
&gt;  
&gt;This leads me to my final point, addressing the ult changes. Oh boy.  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, it's important to understand that Quinn's ultimate is important not JUST from a gameplay perspective, but also from a lore and thematic perspective. There's been a lot of talk about that already, but I'll summarize my feelings here.  
&gt;  
&gt;On release, Quinn was named _Quinn &amp; Valor_ in game and in the loading screen (this is obviously where my name comes from). This had huge implications, as it was the first time a champion had ever had two names within the chat and loading border. This had the effect of really depicting the two as a team: Valor was just as important to the champion as Quinn was, and the two were a team that worked together. For what I remember being an issue with name length or spaces, this was eventually shortened in game to just "Quinn," which took a lot away from the champion and was an unfortunate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;This aspect of a "two-for-one" champion is what made Quinn and Valor unique and fun for many (me included). Their original kit was perfect at portraying this, and it was amazing how much playing as Valor felt like playing as an eagle: you became a swift predator. Carries would do anything they could to get away from Valor, and using E to swoop down on them before Qing and using Skystrike to claim your prey feels _simply amazing._ Even if you were using the ult for other purposes, such as the out-of-combat movement speed or attack speed increase, you still felt like you were flying. Valor's auto attack animations are some of the most fascinating in the game to me, and I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the thought of never seeing them again is saddening. The entirety of Valor's kit kept this crisp feeling from before too: the sharp dash from E, the sound of Valor's autos, Skystrike itself - everything felt powerful.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that the new kit throws all of this to the wind in favor of . . . more mobility(?) is really sad, as it portrays Valor as more of a tool than a half of the champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking away Quinn's blind and early game damage completely change her style of play. In many ways, taking away the blind feels more like a lazy solution to a sometimes-buggy ability, and limits Quinn's potential for meaningful decision-making greatly. The difference in timing when using the blind could make or break a Quinn player, and if you used it when you didn't need to and the enemy flashed away, you then had little take them down with from a range. That said, taking away the blind, while worrying and disheartening, is bearable (rip "Gouge'm Valor" though). Throwing Valor to the wind (heh) is not though.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Quinn's ult is what defined her**, and gave her a great amount of opportunities to cope with bad team-fighting. The ult was one of the most meaningful decisions of all: using it too early ended up in wasting it. Using it to escape a fight meant not having it for an assassination, split-push, or escape later. Committing and using ult for an assassination left Quinn and Valor with little for an escape. Tag Team was great, and it's use defined a Quinn player. Now instead, players don't have that decision to make, as there is little cost for using an ult, and it's pretty obvious when you should: are you gonna be walking for awhile? Press R. Tag Team originally provided more-or-less the same mobility, but came at a meaningful cost and was FUN to use and helped give a thematic foundation to a great champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In Conclusion**  
&gt;  
&gt;Does this rework give Quinn an isolated identity as a roaming ADC? **Yes**  
&gt;Is that identity preferable to Quinn's previous state? **Possibly?**  
&gt;Is this reworked Quinn more unique and fun to play than the old Quinn? **NO. NOT BY A LONG SHOT.**  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;This rework changes a lot of what people loved about Quinn. While some of the changes are understandable, completely redefining half of a champion into a tool is saddening, and the rework greatly limits meaningful decision making and makes playing Quinn a long and repetitive (almost autopilot) process of procing your passive and pressing R to reposition so you can proc your passive some more. Ultimately the new Quinn feels less unique and closer to a blander cookie-cutter ADC.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Edit: [Here's some food for thought:](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/sftAEOEo-between-two-turrets-chat-with-ironstylus-completed?comment=00390000) "In terms of Quinn, I'd probably really re-explore why she has to be an ADC. I'm not sure we fully explored the melee version with enough rigor or time. I'd love to break her back down, find that core fundamental and build upon that." - IronStylus**

 **About the Harrowing**

&gt;Hey everyone!  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of you have questions around the Harrowing this year, and we wanted to give you a quick update:  
&gt;  
&gt;In October, we shared that the Harrowing (and other seasonal events) are changing. You can check out the PBE Boards post [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/Grefbrd1-a-note-about-the-harrowing?sort_type=recent) (sorry we didn\u2019t post it to the main Boards as well, our bad).   
&gt;  
&gt;In short: We\u2019re releasing Legacy skins from past Harrowing events later this week. Zombie / Slayer skins are also rolling out soon, so get those chainsaws ready. We wanted to get you in the mood with a dark and terrifying tale of the unliving, \u201c[Shadow and Fortune: A Harrowing Story](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/index.html),\u201d as well as updated biographies for some of our Shadow Isles champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if you\u2019re wondering about Snowdown, we have some great stuff in our bag of goodies that\u2019ll look a little different from what you\u2019ve previously seen. So hold on for info on that, we\u2019ll share more once we have all the details sorted out.

&gt;Sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is Call for Help:  
&gt;  
&gt;If a champion auto attacks another champion, then find all allied minions and turrets in a "large" ring centered on the champion being attacked. Those minions and turrets found in that ring then check if the attacking champion is within their auto attack range (+ a rather significant search area increase of 400 units if the responder is a minion).  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's an example of the ring:  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/MUiBUPW.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;That part isn't changing.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;What's changing is that there is now a **second** ring.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to searching for allied minions and turrets around the champion being attacked, there's a second search around the champions that's attacking. This search is the same size, but only affects minions (not turrets). Minions responding to the second ring don't search beyond their attack radius though. They respond only if they could naturally attack the attacker.  
&gt;  
&gt;This looks like:  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/7OSaRQY.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;(red is the current ring, blue is the new secondary ring)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Also in the prior image, you'll notice the ranged minions have aggro'd on Caitlyn. This would not have happened in the current game because those minions are outside the red ring.

Melees don't really have this luxury;  They tend to be forced out of lane by ranged champs, especially when the ranged champ has a support to peel for them, but equally importantly the defensive bonuses (HP, AR, MR) for leveling are MUCH more important for them than marksmen, both because being melee makes them far more vulnerable, and because they tend to get higher stats per level.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes along WITH a marksmen in the duo lane**, which means they'd be overpowered enough not only to make up for the assets of what they replaced (such as a zone control mage), but also to brute force through itemization and compositions meant to counter marksmen.

&gt;  
&gt;I'm not saying nothing else CAN work bot lane, but they are by far the most reliable option. Reliability is ultimately what has cemented their position bot lane in the first place.

&gt;It's coming when it's ready, which maaaay be sooner than later. Trying for before the end of the year.   
&gt;  
&gt;The actual work itself is just changing a few numbers around (and maybe doing a little art polish), but developing averages and standards takes a bit longer. How big is too big, how small is too small, etc? How relative should characters be to their 'actual' size (spoilers: in-game comes first)? How much should in-game durability relate to character size?   
&gt;  
&gt;We've made really good progress on these questions, so I want to get them to you as soon as possible. If this tides you over at all, here's an example of one of the more requested size changes. As a small test run, she'll be going out in 5.22.

 **Gangplank's Barrrels**

&gt;As a League of Legends player, personally, I have been playing for FOUR YEARS. This game that I have come to enjoy my free time in happiness or sometimes anger. But today, and for the pass week, I've come against a Gangplank plenty of times. Recently I've noticed that his barrels do immense damage to a player or a whole team. The barrel also slows and grant Gangplank temporary movement speed. Now I think that Gangplanks Barrels should receive a small or medium nerf. I think that the damage that comes from the barrels be reduced and possibly have the slow removed. But that's just my nerf opinion and I will support any nerf to the Gangplank barrels. Thank you for reading my opinion about Gangplank and have a good day.

&gt;Won't be in 5.22 at the very least. Hoping we might be able to get changes out later this year, lot of other stuff underway though so possible that work ends up getting delayed.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of scope of work we'll probably be looking at small, to somewhat small, changes to the sizes of around 30 champs, plus some individual skins that don't match their base well (e.g. Battlecast Kog's huge, Marquis Vlad's tiny). Changes should be noticeable when compared side by side, but certainly won't completely redefine a champion's perceived size (Malphite's will probably get noticeably bigger for example, but he's not going to be rivalling the biggest champs in the game).

 **[Feedback] Master tier rewards**

&gt;Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm Makos, a player on EU since season 1, EUNE after the server split. I managed to get master tier last year, and enjoyed the rewards. I got master tier again for the 2nd time this season, though things have changed now.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://boost-rankedboost.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/master-loading-screen-border.png  
&gt;This is the Master tier border for season 4. It looks like challenger:   
&gt;https://boost-rankedboost.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/challenger-loading-screen-border.png  
&gt;It makes sense, both tiers are available to a few amount of players, have no divisions, and players can exceed 100 LP in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the master tier border for this year (3rd) compared to the challenger one (4th)  
&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QKtg3SSgTeo/VjhkoctEDeI/AAAAAAAAHys/wQCSbwTGKAU/s1600/brmc.jpg  
&gt;We can immediately contrast the borders, the different colors always existed to differentiate the two tiers, and most importantly, the master border  no longer has the extra design at the bottom, while the crystal is at the corner instead of being displayed like the challenger one.  
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pzd2VdzS38c/Vjhf2NR3rII/AAAAAAAAHyA/rNkdEhGE4Bk/s1600/diamond.jpg  
&gt;These are the diamond borders division by division. Notice anything?  
&gt;It looks like master with different colors. Maybe looks better as well. But why is Master tier portrayed similar to Diamond, when instead it should be similar to Challenger due to its actual similarities?  
&gt;  
&gt;I think you get my point, the border doesn't look epic enough, and for a 0.06% of the top players its compared to another that represents the top 2.5%, while challenger is the top 0.02%. Mathematically, the difference between 0.06 and 0.02 is smaller than the one in 0.06 and 2.50.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a similar note, the icon suffers from the same, in my opinion to an even higher extent.  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/nwhlCk0.jpg  
&gt;This is the Season 4 master tier icon. It looks cool and rewarding.  
&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AM-wdMSiR7w/VjhHVbsi5KI/AAAAAAAAzyQ/wEGVEVx7Uks/s1600/profileIcon965.jpg  
&gt;This is the bronze icon for the current season. Why am i talking about bronze? Cause I'm just kidding, this is actually the master tier icon. It looks like bronze, or maybe something between bronze and gold though, doesn't it? In my opinion it does, here's the actual bronze icon   
&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Je0JxeNgUto/VjhH0S85HFI/AAAAAAAAz0Y/IcyLO711BDI/s1600/profileIcon950.jpg  
&gt;I wouldn't be mad if anyone confused them, they look pretty similar. Though the one represents objectively the worst players, while the other represents one of the best. But why do they look so similar? It doesn't make sense.   
&gt;  
&gt;Let's do what we did with borders, compare master to diamond and challenger.  
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lXUZxQc_x88/VjhHVyKj9pI/AAAAAAAAzyg/ZbHmMOPz2e0/s1600/profileIcon968.jpg  
&gt;The challenger one (positions 200-51 to be exact) expectedly looks more epic, and should be. Though its not really similar to the master one. On the other hand there's Diamond.   
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9VWYUOy44xM/VjhHU6E60WI/AAAAAAAAzyM/jCIHAxBIrjo/s1600/profileIcon962.jpg  
&gt;Compared to master it looks like something that's rewarded for better players. Its shinier, and has less black background.  
&gt;  
&gt;To summarize, master tier rewards feel pretty underwhelming compared to last season. Master tier is a tier comparable to Challenger by all means, when the rewards for this season are comparable with Diamond (specifically the border), and even bronze, when speaking about the icon. I have by no means anything against Riot, but I feel like they need a redesign as they bring no justice to the top players. I'm speaking for the entirety of the  Master Tier playerbase, and I hope that we agree on the fact that they are worse than last season's.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reading.

 **There's a very significant nerf to thresh on PBE that I don't think anyone's noticed.**

&gt;Last whisper now only works against bonus Armor, not base, and was made cheaper (only 1300 gold) with powerful upgrades to compensate.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, unlike everyone else, Thresh doesn't get base armor added per level, but rather gets **_bonus_** armor added for every soul he takes.  
&gt;  
&gt;This effectively makes Last whisper and its upgrades far more effective against him than anyone else.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lets compare live Last Whisper with its contemporary partner on PBE - Lord Domik's Regards. Both give 40 AD, and effectively cost the same (LDR cost more, but gold income is up about an equal amount), so we can ignore that in our comparison. However, LDR also gives 1.5% damage amplification per 50 hp the target has over you, capping at 15% at 500 hp. Thresh gets that on the new Sight Stone + Targons combo alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Assuming Thresh has 90 armor, 16 of which is base, live Last Whisper results in at 90 x .65 = 58.5 effective armor, or 36.9% damage reduction  
&gt;  
&gt;With LDR, it is 16 + (74 x .6) = 60.4 effective armor, or 37.7% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .377) x 1.15) = 28.3% damage reduction.   
&gt;  
&gt;LDR ends up doing (1 - .283) / (1 - .369) = 13.6% increased damage against Thresh vs the Last Whisper on live.  
&gt;  
&gt;For comparison, lets look at Blitz. Lets say he's level 12 for a base AD 63.8, with a glacial shroud (20 armor) and 9 flat armor from his glyphs armor from runes, for a total of 92.8 armor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Live Last Whisper results in at 92.8 x .65 = 60.3 effective armor, or 37.6% damage reduction  
&gt;  
&gt;With LDR, it is 63.8 + (29 x .6) = 81.2 effective armor, or 55.2% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .552) x 1.15) = 48.5% damage reduction.   
&gt;  
&gt;LDR ends up doing (1 - .485) / (1 - .376) = 17.5 % LESS damage than of LW on live.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this second example really shows is that LW on live is a a great damage multiplier, regardless of if your opponent built armor, while the LDR is only useful if your opponent is stacking armor _**or is Thresh.**_  
&gt;  
&gt;_Well this post seems to have gotten quite popular. This was just a cute quirk I noted while working on the third of a series of large posts, **The State of Marksmen**. [Part one](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) is about the issues with marksmen on live, and [part two](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet) is about the issues that the marksmen rework does, doesn't, and needs to address. My next post in the series is going to be about the new masteries and items, and the effects they will have on the meta, rather than about systematic issues surrounding marksmen. I'll be addressing Thresh in particular; he's worse off for reasons beyond armor pen. In particular, the masteries favor specialist roles, rather than generalist.

 **[PBE - 5.22] Adjustments to Killstreak Bounty Rules and Bounty Displays**

&gt;We've made a couple of adjustments to the Bounty System for the Preseason - Killstreaks have been altered significantly and the rewards from Bounties have been replaced.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Goals**  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, spending additional resources to shut down a unit that has a high bounty should be a decent call to make.  However, in the current way that bounties are formulated - often times - it isn't worth the time or investment to try to reverse or stall a winner.  
&gt;  
&gt;When we make comeback bounties too high on an individual basis - you get some wild rubberbanding logic over the course of a lane, making lane accomplishes feel moot in a lot of ways.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, because these bounties are compounded by the assist pool - a losing team can easily be behind simply due to an assassin doing his job too well - as he frequently deprives his team of assist pool bonuses on high profile targets.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to make the Bounty system more visible - so players can use it as a better threat indicator and performance evaluator for the short term - as well as attempt to fairly compensate the additional resources required to shut down a target on a 2-0 or 3-0 killstreak without causing huge rubberbanding in lane cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bounty Rules**  
&gt;  
&gt;Champions now begin to accrue a Bounty once they have gotten 2 consecutive kills without dying, like live - and will set you to Bounty Tier '2' (like live.)    
&gt;  
&gt;The more kills you get, the higher your bounty 'Tier', up to a maximum of Bounty 'Tier' 5 - which is the same as live.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Major Changes**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bounty 'Tier'  are now visualized next to your champion health bar. Higher 'Tiers' of Bounties will have progressively more impressive icons.  You will be able to see both the Bounty Tier of allies and enemy champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dying **no longer** resets your Bounty **entirely**.  Instead, it decays your Bounty 'Tier'  by **3** 'Tier'.  If you have a Bounty 'Tier' of 3 or less, this means it will reset completely.  If you have a Bounty Tier of 4 or 5 - you will go to 1 and 2 respectively.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bounties now give **Team** gold rather than adding to kill gold.  Killing a champion with a Bounty will display the total amount of Team Gold awarded to the enemy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bounty Rewards by Tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;Tier 1: 25 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 2: 45 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 3: 75 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 4: 100 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 5: 120 Global Gold (MAX)  
&gt;  
&gt;*Note*: You can only ever get to Bounty Tier 1 by having a Tier 4 Bounty and dying.  Champions on a 2-kill streak will start at Bounty Tier 2.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Additional Note**: We are purposefully inflating the amount of gold given out due to the gold efficiency changes on items - this is due to the fact that many items sat at around a 40% gold efficiency mark or so - and we've adjusted them down quite heavily to have better item and decision balance between items.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Examples of this in Practice**  
&gt;  
&gt;Darius has scored an early double kill in top lane.  He now has a Tier 2 Bounty.   The Jungler comes and with the assistance of the top laner - they murder Darius for 300 Gold plus 150 Assist Gold pus 220 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gold bonus is in contrast to live, which he would be worth 370 Kill Gold + 185 Assist Gold =&gt; 555 Total Gold.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Example: Tier 5**  
&gt;  
&gt;Riven is murdering everyone due to insanity at early snowballing.  She has a Tier 5 Bounty from going 5-0. On Live, she would be worth 500 kill gold and 250 Assist Gold =&gt; 750 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the new Bounty System, she would be worth 300 kill gold, 150 Assist Gold and 600 Team  Gold =&gt; 1050 Total Gold. If she dies at Tier 5 Bounty, she then drops down to Tier 2 Bounty status. She then gets killed again without getting more kills, she'll award 300 Kill Gold, 150 Assist Gold and 220 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.

 **Help us bugtest the new Champ Select!**

&gt;In about ~2 hours, we'll be opening the new Champ Select experience on the PBE.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's important to note that this is all **WORK IN PROGRESS!** and there's still a lot of polish and bugfixes that the team would like to do before the system is ready for live play. We also need your help triaging a nasty bug that we've been having difficulty nailing down.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;During transitions (when it becomes your turn, or after you finish your turn), sometimes the client freezes and forces you to reboot the client and re-log in to the match. If this happens, please post the following information:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Describe what's currently on the screen -- who's turn was it?  
&gt;2) Describe what was happening right before the client froze -- what did you click?  
&gt;3) Were you able to reconnect and play the game, or did it end in a queue dodge?  
&gt;4) If you know how, please send a dxdiag to lyte@riotgames.com  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your help in making this the best experience it can be.

&gt;**ASSIST 'STREAKS' REMOVED** Gold bonuses from having multiple assists without killing a champion have been **removed** entirely.  The majority of this gold has been moved to either starting Tier 1 support items, ambient gold or floated to more global gold from objectives and champions.

The assist pool rule we've removed as we've been unhappy with its actual impact on the game as the complexity cost versus the impact on the game hasn't been favorable (due to intrinsically favoring large team fight compositions rather than a more even balanced between split pushing, team fighting and hard pushing.)

 **[SUGGESTION] A New Ping Option to Identify Enemy Champions by Their Roles.**

&gt;Communication of opponent champions' locations is one of the most crucial parts of the gameplay.  
&gt;During the laning phase, you can warn allies of possible ganks and countergank opportunities.  
&gt;Post laning phase, knowledge of enemy misposition can often lead to a favorable teamfight or objectives (barron, dragon, towers...etc).  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, our ping system has one ping that can accommodate for all the instances a ping can be used to signal enemy positions: the warning sign (or the general all purpose blue ping). Usually, after a warning ping, the player has to type in chat what the warning is for, or just trust that his/her allies will become very passive until they identify it as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**I would like to propose a new type of ping, where you can specify the enemy champion's role.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With this ping, you will be able to select the role (top, mid, adc, supp, jg) of the enemy champion you saw.  
&gt;For example, if you see the enemy jg passing by one of the deep wards you placed, you will be able to use this ping to specifically pinpoint the enemy jg's position to your allies.   
&gt;This will cut out the need to take time to type in chat while enhancing the degree of information you can provide to your allies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, in settings where you are communicating over voice chat with your teammates, the value of this ping diminishes.  
&gt;However, I would like to point out that in vast majority of the games (soloQ and duoQ), you will not be connected over voice with all 4 other members of your team.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is immense potential of what this ping can bring to the gameplay, by allowing teams to communicate more efficiently and accurately.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please upvote if you would like to see this ping in game, or leave comments if you have suggestions / ideas.

[SpecterVonBaren wrote on 2015-11-02 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Aay04nFk-can-we-talk-about-how-bad-the-skarner-rework-is):

 **Can we talk about how bad the Skarner rework is?**

&gt;http://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Skarner_0.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;Before his rework, I fancied myself a regular player of Skarner, I loved being a sticky, dangerous bug of fear that caught people out of position and dragged them away to their doom, I also felt very sure of myself playing him and did very well most of the time. Ever since his rework though, I played him a few times and have now completely dropped him from my roster of played champs because he\u2019s no longer good at what I played him for and the kit he has now is incredibly boring.  
&gt;  
&gt;Riot stated with the Juggernaut rework that they \u201cwanted Skarner to have something truly unique to him\u201d when he\u2019s unable to use his ultimate to kidnap someone. Their solution was to give him the six crystals that are placed on the map when he\u2019s on a team, they said that \u201cwith these changes, Skarner becomes a neutral objective control king, and super useful for teams looking to overcome their enemies with buff and map control.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not what happened. While Skarner received a huge boost in popularity and was seen as being OP, no one picked him or thought he was OP because of his ability to control objectives, it was because he was a tanky unkillable monster that you couldn\u2019t keep from barreling through your team and killing everyone in sight.   
&gt;  
&gt;I\u2019ve said before in many threads but the Skarner rework goes against an oft quoted design philosophy of Riot which is that they do not like ball of stats champions and regret the ones that are in the game that came about from earlier years. Skarner is currently nothing but a ball of stats champion who\u2019s passive is to give him more stats when fighting in specific areas. And this was even something that is the exact opposite of what they were trying to achieve. They said that they felt Skarner, as he was before the rework, was just a generic bruiser that never had a real reason to pick him over someone else but that\u2019s what he\u2019s been turned into, ever since his nerfs I barely ever see Skarner picked at all in ranked or normals because, since his stats no longer make him OP there\u2019s no reason to pick him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, the goal of the rework, to make him a neutral objective controller is impossible to do without completely changing his kit, because his kit is not designed for controlling objectives, nothing in his kit rewards him for, or encourages him to fight for objectives aside from getting a stat boost from his crystals. His Q is a short range spammable damage ability, the kind of thing someone who gets up in an enemy\u2019s face would use to give out long term dps, his w is a speed boost for catching people that also has a shield to help him survive being in the middle of an enemy team or taking the damage from someone trying to kite him, his E is meant to allow him or a teammate to close the gap and pounce on someone and his ult is a kidnapping tool. None of these abilities are things that a neutral objective controller would want in their kit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Know who DOES have a kit for objective control? Nunu. Nunu has two abilities for controlling things in the jungle, he has his consume for dealing large True damage to monsters to secure them for himself or his team and he has his ult which is great in the jungle and river because of the confined aspect of those places and that fact that he can catch people by surprise with his ult by hiding behind a corner or in a bush to channel for a lot of damage before the enemy realizes it or when they have no choice but to fight in it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But do you know what Skarner\u2019s kit IS good for? What he is SUPPOSED to do? Being a champion that catches someone and then sticks to them and doesn\u2019t let up until they\u2019re destroyed by himself or his team. His previous kit was perfect for this kind of gameplay, with the crystal venom passive, w to move in quick, E to slow someone down, and then Q Q Q to stun them and finish them off or Ult and drag them away into your team.   
&gt;  
&gt;Further, that kit was satisfying. It was satisfying and felt rewarding to get that third hit in just before the person got to their turret so that they got stunned long enough for you and your ally to finish them off. There was a direct goal for you to focus on someone in a fight so that you could stun them either to peel for a teammate or to single out a priority target.   
&gt;  
&gt;Does anyone actually feel any kind of satisfaction from taking a crystal and fighting in it? Where is the decision making in fighting over the crystals? No one ever thinks, \u201cOh no, if we fight here Skarner will be in his crystals, maybe we should try to fight somewhere else.\u201d Because outside of the pro scene, and even in it, fights aren\u2019t something that usually happens because of some kind of war game where you try to take certain objectives over others. Fights happen because of people unexpectedly running into each other, or because you need to either gain or prevent the gaining of a neutral objective. If the enemy team is trying to take Baron, them having Skarner on their team doesn\u2019t factor into whether you fight for it or not, you\u2019ll react to it the same way you would if they didn\u2019t have Skarner on their team.   
&gt;  
&gt;The crystals also don\u2019t actually change anything about whether you can take the enemy or not. Whether Skarner gets a boost from his passive is determined on which team holds the stronger position in the game when a fight occurs near them. If Skarner is fed then the enemy team will avoid his crystals, if he\u2019s behind then the enemy will take it from him without him being able to fight for it, and if the teams are even then it gives him a slight boost to his stats but it only effects him and so his team and the enemy team will just fight like the crystal wasn\u2019t there regardless of who has control of it because whoever wins the fight is determined by positioning, split second decisions, someone being caught out, or people being grouped up too much for a wombo combo, not because Skarner had.  
&gt;  
&gt;The entire problem with the crystals is that they offer no strategic use or planning. The mana regen component only matters when Skarner is farming the jungle, the attack speed component only matters if Skarner is a damage threat on the enemy team which is decided by whether or not he\u2019s ahead or not, and the movespeed bonus mostly matters when farming for movement through the jungle and when its used for teamfights it\u2019s usefulness is again decided by how well or poorly Skarner is already doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;tl;dr  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel I\u2019m starting to ramble a bit so I\u2019ll try to sum up and get to the point. Skarner\u2019s rework is terrible. I love Repertoire for what he did on the forums a couple months back but the rework he created and the intention behind it is incredibly half-assed in its attempts to change Skarner\u2019s niche. All it\u2019s done is made Skarner like he was with his first rework where he\u2019s functional, but unsatisfying to use and offers nothing interesting to his team aside from his ult. His ganks are also back to how they were then with whether the gank succeeds or not depending on whether he lands he E or whether his ally laner has enough CC to lock the enemy down for him to smack around. Further, all his current passive did was take away a lot of his base stats to give him more stats when within the area of his crystals and them being a factor for neutral objective control at all is because of where they\u2019re placed, place them in front of turrets or in the middle of a lane and you immediately change what his supposed niche is focused around. It is a terribly artificial way to give someone a niche and it doesn\u2019t even work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Riot is going to someday come back and rework Skarner yet again, because eventually they\u2019ll realize all these issues with the kit he has now and I can only hope that when they do they turn him back into the sticky inescapable scorpion again but if not then I hope they at least completely change his abilities so he can actually BE a neutral objective controller instead of a generic ball of stats.

[MealReadytoEat wrote on 2015-11-01 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet):

 **The State of Marksmen and the Rework Explained, part 2 (Why this Rework isn't it, Yet)**

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;_In [part 1 of this post, Why they Need a Rework,](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) I detailed the current state of marksmen, and why they are in that state. While this post more or less stands alone, it will make far more sense after reading the first part._  
&gt;  
&gt;My first post made 5 main points :  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives   
&gt;2.  Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor  
&gt;3.  Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + support is the ideal duo lane.  
&gt;4.  Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity  
&gt;5.  All of these detract from making Marksmen fun  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm going to address how each of these is, and could be, addressed in the Marksmen rework.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives._ - This is mostly about towers and inhibitors. Currently, Marksmen are the only class that can take defended towers, especially when good waveclear makes it too risky for melee champs to attack them. The rework address this in two ways - They increased the AP ratio on auto attacks against structures from .4 to .5, and they shifted Marksman itemization away from AD and AS into crit, effectively making them slightly worse against towers. They also slightly more than doubled tower HP while removing their armor and MR. This change makes the Armor and MR they get while no minions are present more significant (if anything a buff to marksmen), but as pen never worked against towers is otherwise completely agnostic - numbers are bigger, but the same % of their hp. I guess it's a nerf to Janna.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, these are good changes, but the extra utility and defenses marksmen items now gives will make defensive options less necessary on marksmen, so in the end I think they will end up taking towers as fast or faster. The removal of armor from towers should have happened a long time ago - when something always has the same effective health, it might as well have that as its actual health. Damage against towers is now much clearer - either 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. It still punishes hybrid champs, as it only takes into account the higher of 1/2 of your AP, or your bonus AD.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's two other thing I'd like to see to  address the monopoly of Marksmen on tower siege; Ohmwrecker becoming  a real item for sieging towers, oriented towards mid to late game 5 man dives under towers defended with ranged waveclear rather than "that item that junglers rush to dive towers early game", and another AP item with strong function against towers. Nashor's would be a good candidate.  
&gt;__________________________________________________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor_ - HP can be purchased without seriously harming a champions offensive budget; RoA, Rylai's, Black Cleaver, Mallet, etc, while offensive armor items are left to Zhonya's, and to a lesser extent Sunfire Cape. HP alone is enough to survive the burst of assassin, or CD gated combo from most bruiser and fighters, yet the high sustained damage of marksmen forced large chunks of the champion pool to build some form of armor. This in turn enabled magic damage based champions to remain effective, especially against champions with a large defense budget (tanks).  
&gt;  
&gt;Juggernauts, including the likes of Olaf, have actually addressed this fairly well.  Melee carries can't typically fill this role, as squishy melees have much greater vulnerability and lower reliability. Coordination and CC is much more valid against a melee than a ranged back liner.  Juggernauts, on the other hand, can survive a reasonable level of CC and focus, while still putting out enough DPS that health stacking can't negate them. Mordkaiser simply works in reverse - he forces the building of MR, as he has high sustained damage and % hp magic damage, enabling AD burst on his team to function.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some improvements to DPS options for AD assassins and bruisers would help, but the items changes on PBE accomplish this to some extent. Ghostblade will be a much better option for bruisers, while crit builds with a bit of AS will be better for assassins, thanks to two high AD items, as well as trinity force, offering 20% crit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Among all the issues with marksmen, this is the one Riot has been doing the best at address. Things aren't perfect, but since 5.16 this alone no longer necessitates marksmen in a team comp.  
&gt;_____  
&gt;_Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + Support is the ideal duo lane._ - This the elephant in the room for the marksmen rework. Marksmen have been given the variety and versatility needed to play outside of bot lane, while nothing has been done to make them less optimal in the duo lane. In fact, they've had their scaling per level reduced even further while their level 1 AD was buffed, making XP even less of an issue. I threw out some idea's on how to fix this[ here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carryhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carry)  
&gt;Relic shield give 2 gp 10 on the pbe, which makes it a slightly better option for carries bot lane, but ultimately it's nearly as good for marksmen as it is melees. Mordekaiser has a gimmick on his W to get around this, but that's a gimmick, not a systematic or itemization change that would result in real variety. It just got nerfed, and the item changes screw him pretty hard anyway.   
&gt;  
&gt;Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes when they are overpowered enough that teams can't successfully pick or itemize against multiple marksmen, even after the opportunity cost of what they replaced is paid.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity_ - The rework's on PBE makes ADC's far more diverse and fun to play. Going on these one by one is going to be my next post in this series, but by and large they now have enjoyable game play and diversity. There's now multiple build paths available to each marksmen, and noticeably different builds between marksmen, due to multiple items that give noticeable defenses while still being quite offensive, and good CDR options.   
&gt;  
&gt;Riot did a fairly good job addressing the monotony of playing ADC's, and the homogeneity between them, without addressing the systematic changes that resulted in them being balanced into the state they are in in the first place.  
&gt;___________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_All of these detract from making Marksmen fun_ - If I were to give a number, I'd say that riot has dealt with half the balancing issue that have resulted in Marksmen being unfun to play in the first place. They then made them fun, without regard to the remaining balance issues holding them back on live. This is an early iteration of the PBE; I still have high hopes they will begin to address the remaining issue soon. Otherwise, expect a minimum of 4 marksmen a game.  
&gt;  
&gt;_Part 3 is going to be feedback and analysis of the current champions, items, and game changes on PBE right now, rather than any systematic explanation of the game or the meta._  
&gt;  
&gt;_Please leave feedback, I'll try to address any questions._  
&gt;

&gt;Q: Tumble Mana: 30  
&gt;CD 4/3.5/3/2.5/2  Cooldown starts upon activation  
&gt;Vayne tumbles, firing a bolt at the nearest enemy champion, range 450, dealing 110/115/120/125/130% of her AD as physical damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;W: Purifying Focus  
&gt;Passive  
&gt;Every time Vayne attacks a singular target without swapping targets, her damage is increased against that target by 2% per auto attack. This passive applies to all targets she attacks, but is removed against the last target once she swaps.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: Condemn  
&gt;CD 20/18/16/14/12 Mana: 90  
&gt;Vayne fires a heavy bolt at the heart of an enemy, stunning them if they are within 300 range of her, and slowing them for 50% for 1 second otherwise, dealing 70% of her AD as physical damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Final Hour  
&gt;CD 100/85/70 Mana: 90 (This is new Vayne's balancing point)   
&gt;Vayne gains 30/60/90 Attack Damage, 50% Attack Speed, 30/60/90 movement speed, and her attack speed cap is removed for 15 seconds. Her auto attacks CANNOT crit during the duration of Final Hour.  
&gt;During this time, all of Vayne's damage from all sources is halved, but is all converted to **True Damage**  
&gt;  
&gt;New Vayne's purpose is purely to obliterate tanks and juggernauts alike.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tell me whether or not you like this rework, as it removes the max health True damage, but adds that ult. There is supposed to be a fourth poll option : No, too much True damage.

 **Idea to Add more to Caitlyn's Identity**

&gt;I think Caitlyn's Ultimate "Ace in the Hole" should fire through targets if they are killed by the bullet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ex. Low health Soraka and a Low health Ez. Caitlyn locks in on Ez, but Soraka walks in the way to block the bullet. The bullet should fire through Soraka and still kill Ez.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think a change like this would really add to Caitlyn's identity as a sniper.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: Of course the bullet should scale down in damage with each champion it passes through.

 **The State of Marksmen and the Rework Explained, part 2 (Why this Rework isn't it, Yet)**

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;_In [part 1 of this post, Why they Need a Rework,](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) I detailed the current state of marksmen, and why they are in that state. While this post more or less stands alone, it will make far more sense after reading the first part._  
&gt;  
&gt;My first post made 5 main points :  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives   
&gt;2.  Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor  
&gt;3.  Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + support is the ideal duo lane.  
&gt;4.  Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity  
&gt;5.  All of these detract from making Marksmen fun  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm going to address how each of these is, and could be, addressed in the Marksmen rework.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to take contested objectives._ - This is mostly about towers and inhibitors. Currently, Marksmen are the only class that can take defended towers, especially when good waveclear makes it too risky for melee champs to attack them. The rework address this in two ways - They increased the AP ratio on auto attacks against structures from .4 to .5, and they shifted Marksman itemization away from AD and AS into crit, effectively making them slightly worse against towers. They also slightly more than doubled tower HP while removing their armor and MR. This change makes the Armor and MR they get while no minions are present more significant (if anything a buff to marksmen), but as pen never worked against towers is otherwise completely agnostic - numbers are bigger, but the same % of their hp. I guess it's a nerf to Janna.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, these are good changes, but the extra utility and defenses marksmen items now gives will make defensive options less necessary on marksmen, so in the end I think they will end up taking towers as fast or faster. The removal of armor from towers should have happened a long time ago - when something always has the same effective health, it might as well have that as its actual health. Damage against towers is now much clearer - either 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. It still punishes hybrid champs, as it only takes into account the higher of 1/2 of your AP, or your bonus AD.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's two other thing I'd like to see to  address the monopoly of Marksmen on tower siege; Ohmwrecker becoming  a real item for sieging towers, oriented towards mid to late game 5 man dives under towers defended with ranged waveclear rather than "that item that junglers rush to dive towers early game", and another AP item with strong function against towers. Nashor's would be a good candidate.  
&gt;__________________________________________________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_Teams need a marksmen to force their opponents to spend gold and item slots on armor_ - HP can be purchased without seriously harming a champions offensive budget; RoA, Rylai's, Black Cleaver, Mallet, etc, while offensive armor items are left to Zhonya's, and to a lesser extent Sunfire Cape. HP alone is enough to survive the burst of assassin, or CD gated combo from most bruiser and fighters, yet the high sustained damage of marksmen forced large chunks of the champion pool to build some form of armor. This in turn enabled magic damage based champions to remain effective, especially against champions with a large defense budget (tanks).  
&gt;  
&gt;Juggernauts, including the likes of Olaf, have actually addressed this fairly well.  Melee carries can't typically fill this role, as squishy melees have much greater vulnerability and lower reliability. Coordination and CC is much more valid against a melee than a ranged back liner.  Juggernauts, on the other hand, can survive a reasonable level of CC and focus, while still putting out enough DPS that health stacking can't negate them. Mordkaiser simply works in reverse - he forces the building of MR, as he has high sustained damage and % hp magic damage, enabling AD burst on his team to function.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some improvements to DPS options for AD assassins and bruisers would help, but the items changes on PBE accomplish this to some extent. Ghostblade will be a much better option for bruisers, while crit builds with a bit of AS will be better for assassins, thanks to two high AD items, as well as trinity force, offering 20% crit.   
&gt;  
&gt;Among all the issues with marksmen, this is the one Riot has been doing the best at address. Things aren't perfect, but since 5.16 this alone no longer necessitates marksmen in a team comp.  
&gt;_____  
&gt;_Marksmen scale just as strong or stronger with gold as anyone else, but the least with XP, so a Marksmen + Support is the ideal duo lane._ - This the elephant in the room for the marksmen rework. Marksmen have been given the variety and versatility needed to play outside of bot lane, while nothing has been done to make them less optimal in the duo lane. In fact, they've had their scaling per level reduced even further while their level 1 AD was buffed, making XP even less of an issue. I threw out some idea's on how to fix this[ here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carryhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/x26pEKX7-support-items-added-a-ton-of-variety-and-balancing-options-why-not-the-same-for-the-farming-carry)  
&gt;Relic shield give 2 gp 10 on the pbe, which makes it a slightly better option for carries bot lane, but ultimately it's nearly as good for marksmen as it is melees. Mordekaiser has a gimmick on his W to get around this, but that's a gimmick, not a systematic or itemization change that would result in real variety. It just got nerfed, and the item changes screw him pretty hard anyway.   
&gt;  
&gt;Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes when they are overpowered enough that teams can't successfully pick or itemize against multiple marksmen, even after the opportunity cost of what they replaced is paid.  
&gt;____  
&gt;_Marksmen are uniquely similar and uninteresting, due to the nature of their strategic purposes and necessity_ - The rework's on PBE makes ADC's far more diverse and fun to play. Going on these one by one is going to be my next post in this series, but by and large they now have enjoyable game play and diversity. There's now multiple build paths available to each marksmen, and noticeably different builds between marksmen, due to multiple items that give noticeable defenses while still being quite offensive, and good CDR options.   
&gt;  
&gt;Riot did a fairly good job addressing the monotony of playing ADC's, and the homogeneity between them, without addressing the systematic changes that resulted in them being balanced into the state they are in in the first place.  
&gt;___________________  
&gt;  
&gt;_All of these detract from making Marksmen fun_ - If I were to give a number, I'd say that riot has dealt with half the balancing issue that have resulted in Marksmen being unfun to play in the first place. They then made them fun, without regard to the remaining balance issues holding them back on live. This is an early iteration of the PBE; I still have high hopes they will begin to address the remaining issue soon. Otherwise, expect a minimum of 4 marksmen a game.  
&gt;  
&gt;_Part 3 is going to be feedback and analysis of the current champions, items, and game changes on PBE right now, rather than any systematic explanation of the game or the meta._  
&gt;  
&gt;_Please leave feedback, I'll try to address any questions._  
&gt;

&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; What about legacy harrowing/Halloween skins ? Are they coming back?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know how this is to be handled, however my thoughts on this would be they will be treated as normal legacy skins (don't quote me on this, as I'm purely speculating here).  
&gt;  
&gt;With Harrowing being decoupled from Hallowe'en, I expect this would result in these skins becoming available at different times in the year - not this one time of the year. This may coincide with the "not-hallowe'en harrowing", or it may be entirely random like a lot of the other legacy skins.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, purely my speculation!

[and Valor wrote on 2015-10-30 UTC](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/PE1LJTOM-quinn-pbe-feedback-thread?sort_type=best&amp;comment=00420000):

&gt;I just finished playing some of the new Quinn on PBE, so I figured I'd drop my feedback here.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's pretty obvious at this point that these huge amount of changes left a lot of us emotionally charged. That said, some arguments for both sides are valid. Since most of vocal people in this thread are against the changes, I'll start with what was enjoyable about the new Quinn.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Positives of the New Quinn**  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the most surprising things about playing the new Quinn was how much her strengths have changed. Before the rework, Quinn and Valor were extremely different from other ADCs: Quinn had a strong early game, not only for an adc but as a champion in general (given her E, massive harrier damage, and blind), had qualities of other roles (assassination and split-push potential with ult, dueling potential with blind), and lacked qualities of traditional ADCs (steered away from the typical early-game punching bag to late-game, team-fighting, dps machine power curve).  
&gt;  
&gt;The Quinn rework fixes this alleged "identity crisis" by successfully molding Quinn and Valor into a more stereotypical ad carry. The scaling on her passive, CD refund and execution damage on Q, and removal of Valor as a fighting utility _shifts Quinn into a clearly defined role: a roaming ranged carry,_ which is exactly Riot appears to have set out to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon testing, I noticed her passive becomes vitally significant in the late game especially. Harrier does decent amounts of damage (still obviously less than it used to), but given that her Q applies her passive, she can proc it several times in a row, leading to massive amounts of dps. Quinn still retains most of her ability to chase down targets, but now has a greater emphasis on wearing down targets with multiple autos in quick succession rather than huge burst. Her changes to her passive and Q create a nice and new feeling to Quinn's late game. If I were to try to describe it in words, she just flows so much more now, and everything feels very smooth.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes create a power curve for Quinn similar to other ADCs in that she is generally weak early game with Q and harrier doing little damage, but by late game (especially with a lead) her constant passive procs and Qs equate to a load of damage and plays like most other AD Carries.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rework is bearable and actually pretty fun to play, but has it's own problems as shown below.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So What's Wrong with the New Quinn?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's start from the view of the Quinn mains, or more accurately, _the Quinn **and Valor** mains._  
&gt;  
&gt;Back before Quinn was fully released, when IronStylus was asked about how "satisfying" Quinn's auto's are, he [replied](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3097136&amp;page=201#post34571759):  
&gt;  
&gt;"I find her auto attacks EXTREMELY satisfying. Some of that is animations and VFX, other parts of it are sound, crisp and snappy, and the other part, the novel part, is the special sauce that's a cornerstone of her auto attacks."  
&gt;  
&gt;As a Quinn and Valor main, I couldn't agree more. Not only do Quinn's autos have a "crisp and snappy" feel, but most of her kit does on live right now. The sharp sound of a crit or proc-ing harrier, the snap-back sound effect of her E, and her Q all have a feel similar to paper or a wing being flapped sharply in the air. Add on a shiv-proc or Skystrike, and you have an attack that not only feels strong and sharp, but has the damage to back it up.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is where the problems start with the "new Quinn." There's something inherently satisfying about extending and finally proc-ing harrier and watching your target's health get nuked by a strong auto, similar to the sound of Vayne's W. That upfront damage feeling makes harrier "feel" important, so when Valor marks your next target, it really prompts you to extend for it, leading to meaningful decision-making. Unfortunately, this feeling is something that _the new Quinn rework lacks._ Both harrier and Quinn's Q fail to provide any significant damage when trading in lane, leading to a very wishy-washy and weak feeling. In fact, this Quinn feels similar to Talon right now in that until at least mid-game, you feel _useless._ It isn't until late game that your Q damage makes using the CD refund actually feel worth it (clearing with Q in lane just leads to Quinn being oom), and harrier starts really hurting. Even then though, harrier's damage doesn't seem to compare with how it does per hit on live right now, which makes sense. This unfortunately has the affect of making Quinn's gameplay feel too stoic and smooth compared to her sharp, bursty feel on live right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;This, combined with a lack of Skystrike damage and diving potential that ult used to provide, makes playing Quinn pretty _boring_ by contrast, and dreadfully so in the early-to-mid game. You're not really doing anything but trying to last hit and avoid trading for at least the first 10 minutes of the game, and having an ult that doesn't deal damage isn't helpful at all. Removing the blind from Q also removes the necessary protection Quinn needs to safely engage and disengage in trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quinn also still suffers from terrible range for an ADC, resulting in very sub-par team-fighting, in which to proc any of your marks you must overextend, often leading to your death. Your main focus switches to isolating targets and wittling them down before you finish them off with Q, again a very gradual process lacking any crisp feeling until the execution with Q. This gradual feeling may just be common between ADCs, but that doesn't change that Quinn used to have a more enjoyable play-pattern.  
&gt;  
&gt;This leads me to my final point, addressing the ult changes. Oh boy.  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, it's important to understand that Quinn's ultimate is important not JUST from a gameplay perspective, but also from a lore and thematic perspective. There's been a lot of talk about that already, but I'll summarize my feelings here.  
&gt;  
&gt;On release, Quinn was named _Quinn &amp; Valor_ in game and in the loading screen (this is obviously where my name comes from). This had huge implications, as it was the first time a champion had ever had two names within the chat and loading border. This had the effect of really depicting the two as a team: Valor was just as important to the champion as Quinn was, and the two were a team that worked together. For what I remember being an issue with name length or spaces, this was eventually shortened in game to just "Quinn," which took a lot away from the champion and was an unfortunate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;This aspect of a "two-for-one" champion is what made Quinn and Valor unique and fun for many (me included). Their original kit was perfect at portraying this, and it was amazing how much playing as Valor felt like playing as an eagle: you became a swift predator. Carries would do anything they could to get away from Valor, and using E to swoop down on them before Qing and using Skystrike to claim your prey feels _simply amazing._ Even if you were using the ult for other purposes, such as the out-of-combat movement speed or attack speed increase, you still felt like you were flying. Valor's auto attack animations are some of the most fascinating in the game to me, and I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the thought of never seeing them again is saddening. The entirety of Valor's kit kept this crisp feeling from before too: the sharp dash from E, the sound of Valor's autos, Skystrike itself - everything felt powerful.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that the new kit throws all of this to the wind in favor of . . . more mobility(?) is really sad, as it portrays Valor as more of a tool than a half of the champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking away Quinn's blind and early game damage completely change her style of play. In many ways, taking away the blind feels more like a lazy solution to a sometimes-buggy ability, and limits Quinn's potential for meaningful decision-making greatly. The difference in timing when using the blind could make or break a Quinn player, and if you used it when you didn't need to and the enemy flashed away, you then had little take them down with from a range. That said, taking away the blind, while worrying and disheartening, is bearable (rip "Gouge'm Valor" though). Throwing Valor to the wind (heh) is not though.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Quinn's ult is what defined her**, and gave her a great amount of opportunities to cope with bad team-fighting. The ult was one of the most meaningful decisions of all: using it too early ended up in wasting it. Using it to escape a fight meant not having it for an assassination, split-push, or escape later. Committing and using ult for an assassination left Quinn and Valor with little for an escape. Tag Team was great, and it's use defined a Quinn player. Now instead, players don't have that decision to make, as there is little cost for using an ult, and it's pretty obvious when you should: are you gonna be walking for awhile? Press R. Tag Team originally provided more-or-less the same mobility, but came at a meaningful cost and was FUN to use and helped give a thematic foundation to a great champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In Conclusion**  
&gt;  
&gt;Does this rework give Quinn an isolated identity as a roaming ADC? **Yes**  
&gt;Is that identity preferable to Quinn's previous state? **Possibly?**  
&gt;Is this reworked Quinn more unique and fun to play than the old Quinn? **NO. NOT BY A LONG SHOT.**  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;This rework changes a lot of what people loved about Quinn. While some of the changes are understandable, completely redefining half of a champion into a tool is saddening, and the rework greatly limits meaningful decision making and makes playing Quinn a long and repetitive (almost autopilot) process of procing your passive and pressing R to reposition so you can proc your passive some more. Ultimately the new Quinn feels less unique and closer to a blander cookie-cutter ADC.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Edit: [Here's some food for thought:](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/sftAEOEo-between-two-turrets-chat-with-ironstylus-completed?comment=00390000) "In terms of Quinn, I'd probably really re-explore why she has to be an ADC. I'm not sure we fully explored the melee version with enough rigor or time. I'd love to break her back down, find that core fundamental and build upon that." - IronStylus**

 **About the Harrowing**

&gt;Hey everyone!  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of you have questions around the Harrowing this year, and we wanted to give you a quick update:  
&gt;  
&gt;In October, we shared that the Harrowing (and other seasonal events) are changing. You can check out the PBE Boards post [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/Grefbrd1-a-note-about-the-harrowing?sort_type=recent) (sorry we didn\u2019t post it to the main Boards as well, our bad).   
&gt;  
&gt;In short: We\u2019re releasing Legacy skins from past Harrowing events later this week. Zombie / Slayer skins are also rolling out soon, so get those chainsaws ready. We wanted to get you in the mood with a dark and terrifying tale of the unliving, \u201c[Shadow and Fortune: A Harrowing Story](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/index.html),\u201d as well as updated biographies for some of our Shadow Isles champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if you\u2019re wondering about Snowdown, we have some great stuff in our bag of goodies that\u2019ll look a little different from what you\u2019ve previously seen. So hold on for info on that, we\u2019ll share more once we have all the details sorted out.

&gt;Sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is Call for Help:  
&gt;  
&gt;If a champion auto attacks another champion, then find all allied minions and turrets in a "large" ring centered on the champion being attacked. Those minions and turrets found in that ring then check if the attacking champion is within their auto attack range (+ a rather significant search area increase of 400 units if the responder is a minion).  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's an example of the ring:  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/MUiBUPW.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;That part isn't changing.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;What's changing is that there is now a **second** ring.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to searching for allied minions and turrets around the champion being attacked, there's a second search around the champions that's attacking. This search is the same size, but only affects minions (not turrets). Minions responding to the second ring don't search beyond their attack radius though. They respond only if they could naturally attack the attacker.  
&gt;  
&gt;This looks like:  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/7OSaRQY.jpg  
&gt;  
&gt;(red is the current ring, blue is the new secondary ring)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Also in the prior image, you'll notice the ranged minions have aggro'd on Caitlyn. This would not have happened in the current game because those minions are outside the red ring.

Melees don't really have this luxury;  They tend to be forced out of lane by ranged champs, especially when the ranged champ has a support to peel for them, but equally importantly the defensive bonuses (HP, AR, MR) for leveling are MUCH more important for them than marksmen, both because being melee makes them far more vulnerable, and because they tend to get higher stats per level.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Until this is changed, marksmen will only see play outside of duo lanes along WITH a marksmen in the duo lane**, which means they'd be overpowered enough not only to make up for the assets of what they replaced (such as a zone control mage), but also to brute force through itemization and compositions meant to counter marksmen.

&gt;I'm not saying nothing else CAN work bot lane, but they are by far the most reliable option. Reliability is ultimately what has cemented their position bot lane in the first place.

&gt;It's coming when it's ready, which maaaay be sooner than later. Trying for before the end of the year.   
&gt;  
&gt;The actual work itself is just changing a few numbers around (and maybe doing a little art polish), but developing averages and standards takes a bit longer. How big is too big, how small is too small, etc? How relative should characters be to their 'actual' size (spoilers: in-game comes first)? How much should in-game durability relate to character size?   
&gt;  
&gt;We've made really good progress on these questions, so I want to get them to you as soon as possible. If this tides you over at all, here's an example of one of the more requested size changes. As a small test run, she'll be going out in 5.22.

 **Gangplank's Barrrels**

&gt;As a League of Legends player, personally, I have been playing for FOUR YEARS. This game that I have come to enjoy my free time in happiness or sometimes anger. But today, and for the pass week, I've come against a Gangplank plenty of times. Recently I've noticed that his barrels do immense damage to a player or a whole team. The barrel also slows and grant Gangplank temporary movement speed. Now I think that Gangplanks Barrels should receive a small or medium nerf. I think that the damage that comes from the barrels be reduced and possibly have the slow removed. But that's just my nerf opinion and I will support any nerf to the Gangplank barrels. Thank you for reading my opinion about Gangplank and have a good day.

&gt;Won't be in 5.22 at the very least. Hoping we might be able to get changes out later this year, lot of other stuff underway though so possible that work ends up getting delayed.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of scope of work we'll probably be looking at small, to somewhat small, changes to the sizes of around 30 champs, plus some individual skins that don't match their base well (e.g. Battlecast Kog's huge, Marquis Vlad's tiny). Changes should be noticeable when compared side by side, but certainly won't completely redefine a champion's perceived size (Malphite's will probably get noticeably bigger for example, but he's not going to be rivalling the biggest champs in the game).

 **[Feedback] Master tier rewards**

&gt;Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm Makos, a player on EU since season 1, EUNE after the server split. I managed to get master tier last year, and enjoyed the rewards. I got master tier again for the 2nd time this season, though things have changed now.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://boost-rankedboost.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/master-loading-screen-border.png  
&gt;This is the Master tier border for season 4. It looks like challenger:   
&gt;https://boost-rankedboost.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/challenger-loading-screen-border.png  
&gt;It makes sense, both tiers are available to a few amount of players, have no divisions, and players can exceed 100 LP in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the master tier border for this year (3rd) compared to the challenger one (4th)  
&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QKtg3SSgTeo/VjhkoctEDeI/AAAAAAAAHys/wQCSbwTGKAU/s1600/brmc.jpg  
&gt;We can immediately contrast the borders, the different colors always existed to differentiate the two tiers, and most importantly, the master border  no longer has the extra design at the bottom, while the crystal is at the corner instead of being displayed like the challenger one.  
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pzd2VdzS38c/Vjhf2NR3rII/AAAAAAAAHyA/rNkdEhGE4Bk/s1600/diamond.jpg  
&gt;These are the diamond borders division by division. Notice anything?  
&gt;It looks like master with different colors. Maybe looks better as well. But why is Master tier portrayed similar to Diamond, when instead it should be similar to Challenger due to its actual similarities?  
&gt;  
&gt;I think you get my point, the border doesn't look epic enough, and for a 0.06% of the top players its compared to another that represents the top 2.5%, while challenger is the top 0.02%. Mathematically, the difference between 0.06 and 0.02 is smaller than the one in 0.06 and 2.50.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a similar note, the icon suffers from the same, in my opinion to an even higher extent.  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/nwhlCk0.jpg  
&gt;This is the Season 4 master tier icon. It looks cool and rewarding.  
&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AM-wdMSiR7w/VjhHVbsi5KI/AAAAAAAAzyQ/wEGVEVx7Uks/s1600/profileIcon965.jpg  
&gt;This is the bronze icon for the current season. Why am i talking about bronze? Cause I'm just kidding, this is actually the master tier icon. It looks like bronze, or maybe something between bronze and gold though, doesn't it? In my opinion it does, here's the actual bronze icon   
&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Je0JxeNgUto/VjhH0S85HFI/AAAAAAAAz0Y/IcyLO711BDI/s1600/profileIcon950.jpg  
&gt;I wouldn't be mad if anyone confused them, they look pretty similar. Though the one represents objectively the worst players, while the other represents one of the best. But why do they look so similar? It doesn't make sense.   
&gt;  
&gt;Let's do what we did with borders, compare master to diamond and challenger.  
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lXUZxQc_x88/VjhHVyKj9pI/AAAAAAAAzyg/ZbHmMOPz2e0/s1600/profileIcon968.jpg  
&gt;The challenger one (positions 200-51 to be exact) expectedly looks more epic, and should be. Though its not really similar to the master one. On the other hand there's Diamond.   
&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9VWYUOy44xM/VjhHU6E60WI/AAAAAAAAzyM/jCIHAxBIrjo/s1600/profileIcon962.jpg  
&gt;Compared to master it looks like something that's rewarded for better players. Its shinier, and has less black background.  
&gt;  
&gt;To summarize, master tier rewards feel pretty underwhelming compared to last season. Master tier is a tier comparable to Challenger by all means, when the rewards for this season are comparable with Diamond (specifically the border), and even bronze, when speaking about the icon. I have by no means anything against Riot, but I feel like they need a redesign as they bring no justice to the top players. I'm speaking for the entirety of the  Master Tier playerbase, and I hope that we agree on the fact that they are worse than last season's.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reading.

 **There's a very significant nerf to thresh on PBE that I don't think anyone's noticed.**

&gt;Last whisper now only works against bonus Armor, not base, and was made cheaper (only 1300 gold) with powerful upgrades to compensate.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, unlike everyone else, Thresh doesn't get base armor added per level, but rather gets **_bonus_** armor added for every soul he takes.  
&gt;  
&gt;This effectively makes Last whisper and its upgrades far more effective against him than anyone else.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lets compare live Last Whisper with its contemporary partner on PBE - Lord Domik's Regards. Both give 40 AD, and effectively cost the same (LDR cost more, but gold income is up about an equal amount), so we can ignore that in our comparison. However, LDR also gives 1.5% damage amplification per 50 hp the target has over you, capping at 15% at 500 hp. Thresh gets that on the new Sight Stone + Targons combo alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Assuming Thresh has 90 armor, 16 of which is base, live Last Whisper results in at 90 x .65 = 58.5 effective armor, or 36.9% damage reduction  
&gt;  
&gt;With LDR, it is 16 + (74 x .6) = 60.4 effective armor, or 37.7% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .377) x 1.15) = 28.3% damage reduction.   
&gt;  
&gt;LDR ends up doing (1 - .283) / (1 - .369) = 13.6% increased damage against Thresh vs the Last Whisper on live.  
&gt;  
&gt;For comparison, lets look at Blitz. Lets say he's level 12 for a base AD 63.8, with a glacial shroud (20 armor) and 9 flat armor from his glyphs armor from runes, for a total of 92.8 armor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Live Last Whisper results in at 92.8 x .65 = 60.3 effective armor, or 37.6% damage reduction  
&gt;  
&gt;With LDR, it is 63.8 + (29 x .6) = 81.2 effective armor, or 55.2% damage reduction; however, the damage is amplified by 15%, for (1 - (1 - .552) x 1.15) = 48.5% damage reduction.   
&gt;  
&gt;LDR ends up doing (1 - .485) / (1 - .376) = 17.5 % LESS damage than of LW on live.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this second example really shows is that LW on live is a a great damage multiplier, regardless of if your opponent built armor, while the LDR is only useful if your opponent is stacking armor _**or is Thresh.**_  
&gt;  
&gt;_Well this post seems to have gotten quite popular. This was just a cute quirk I noted while working on the third of a series of large posts, **The State of Marksmen**. [Part one](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework) is about the issues with marksmen on live, and [part two](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet) is about the issues that the marksmen rework does, doesn't, and needs to address. My next post in the series is going to be about the new masteries and items, and the effects they will have on the meta, rather than about systematic issues surrounding marksmen. I'll be addressing Thresh in particular; he's worse off for reasons beyond armor pen. In particular, the masteries favor specialist roles, rather than generalist. I plan on having it out later tonight._

 **[PBE - 5.22] Adjustments to Killstreak Bounty Rules and Bounty Displays**

&gt;We've made a couple of adjustments to the Bounty System for the Preseason - Killstreaks have been altered significantly and the rewards from Bounties have been replaced.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Goals**  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, spending additional resources to shut down a unit that has a high bounty should be a decent call to make.  However, in the current way that bounties are formulated - often times - it isn't worth the time or investment to try to reverse or stall a winner.  
&gt;  
&gt;When we make comeback bounties too high on an individual basis - you get some wild rubberbanding logic over the course of a lane, making lane accomplishes feel moot in a lot of ways.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, because these bounties are compounded by the assist pool - a losing team can easily be behind simply due to an assassin doing his job too well - as he frequently deprives his team of assist pool bonuses on high profile targets.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to make the Bounty system more visible - so players can use it as a better threat indicator and performance evaluator for the short term - as well as attempt to fairly compensate the additional resources required to shut down a target on a 2-0 or 3-0 killstreak without causing huge rubberbanding in lane cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bounty Rules**  
&gt;  
&gt;Champions now begin to accrue a Bounty once they have gotten 2 consecutive kills without dying, like live - and will set you to Bounty Tier '2' (like live.)    
&gt;  
&gt;The more kills you get, the higher your bounty 'Tier', up to a maximum of Bounty 'Tier' 5 - which is the same as live.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Major Changes**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bounty 'Tier'  are now visualized next to your champion health bar. Higher 'Tiers' of Bounties will have progressively more impressive icons.  You will be able to see both the Bounty Tier of allies and enemy champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dying **no longer** resets your Bounty **entirely**.  Instead, it decays your Bounty 'Tier'  by **3** 'Tier'.  If you have a Bounty 'Tier' of 3 or less, this means it will reset completely.  If you have a Bounty Tier of 4 or 5 - you will go to 1 and 2 respectively.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bounties now give **Team** gold rather than adding to kill gold.  Killing a champion with a Bounty will display the total amount of Team Gold awarded to the enemy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bounty Rewards by Tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;Tier 1: 25 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 2: 45 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 3: 75 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 4: 100 Global Gold  
&gt;Tier 5: 120 Global Gold (MAX)  
&gt;  
&gt;*Note*: You can only ever get to Bounty Tier 1 by having a Tier 4 Bounty and dying.  Champions on a 2-kill streak will start at Bounty Tier 2.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Additional Note**: We are purposefully inflating the amount of gold given out due to the gold efficiency changes on items - this is due to the fact that many items sat at around a 40% gold efficiency mark or so - and we've adjusted them down quite heavily to have better item and decision balance between items.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Examples of this in Practice**  
&gt;  
&gt;Darius has scored an early double kill in top lane.  He now has a Tier 2 Bounty.   The Jungler comes and with the assistance of the top laner - they murder Darius for 300 Gold plus 150 Assist Gold pus 220 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gold bonus is in contrast to live, which he would be worth 370 Kill Gold + 185 Assist Gold =&gt; 555 Total Gold.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Example: Tier 5**  
&gt;  
&gt;Riven is murdering everyone due to insanity at early snowballing.  She has a Tier 5 Bounty from going 5-0. On Live, she would be worth 500 kill gold and 250 Assist Gold =&gt; 750 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the new Bounty System, she would be worth 300 kill gold, 150 Assist Gold and 600 Team  Gold =&gt; 1050 Total Gold. If she dies at Tier 5 Bounty, she then drops down to Tier 2 Bounty status. She then gets killed again without getting more kills, she'll award 300 Kill Gold, 150 Assist Gold and 220 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.

 **Help us bugtest the new Champ Select!**

&gt;In about ~2 hours, we'll be opening the new Champ Select experience on the PBE.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's important to note that this is all **WORK IN PROGRESS!** and there's still a lot of polish and bugfixes that the team would like to do before the system is ready for live play. We also need your help triaging a nasty bug that we've been having difficulty nailing down.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;During transitions (when it becomes your turn, or after you finish your turn), sometimes the client freezes and forces you to reboot the client and re-log in to the match. If this happens, please post the following information:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Describe what's currently on the screen -- who's turn was it?  
&gt;2) Describe what was happening right before the client froze -- what did you click?  
&gt;3) Were you able to reconnect and play the game, or did it end in a queue dodge?  
&gt;4) If you know how, please send a dxdiag to lyte@riotgames.com  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your help in making this the best experience it can be.

The assist pool rule we've removed as we've been unhappy with its actual impact on the game as the complexity cost versus the impact on the game hasn't been favorable (due to intrinsically favoring large team fight compositions rather than a more even balanced between split pushing, team fighting and hard pushing.)  
&gt;  
&gt;*Examples of this in Practice*  
&gt;  
&gt;Darius has scored an early double kill in top lane.  He now has a Tier 2 Bounty.   The Jungler comes and with the assistance of the top laner - they murder Darius for 300 Gold plus 150 Assist Gold pus 225 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gold bonus is in contrast to live, which he would be worth 370 Kill Gold + 185 Assist Gold =&gt; 555 Total Gold.    
&gt;  
&gt;*Example: Tier 5*  
&gt;  
&gt;Riven is murdering everyone due to insanity at early snowballing.  She has a Tier 5 Bounty from going 5-0. On Live, she would be worth 500 kill gold and 250 Assist Gold =&gt; 750 Total Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the new Bounty System, she would be worth 300 kill gold, 150 Assist Gold and 600 Team  Gold =&gt; 1050 Total Gold. If she dies at Tier 5 Bounty, she then drops down to Tier 2 Bounty status. She then gets killed again without getting more kills, she'll award 300 Kill Gold, 150 Assist Gold and 225 Team Gold =&gt; 670 Total Gold.

 **Runic Affinity is Going to Shape the Jungle Meta by Itself.**

&gt;The mastery is so strong in the jungle right now. Anyone that has an easily accessible heal or shield bypasses any difficulty the jungle has and currently levels of sustain rivaling warwick or fiddlesticks. If it's left as is I worry for the jungle meta.  
&gt;  
&gt;This allows champions like Rengar and Tryndamere (who were previously thought of as "risky picks") to be very safe and snowball much easier. Champions like Nautilus clear without ease as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, picks like Jarvan and Wukong get wrecked without it. Riot, please.

[Riot Reinboom wrote on 2015-11-04 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/m8EHNfVe-dev-blog-marksman-itemization):

 **DEV BLOG: Marksman Itemization**

&gt;Hello all! Riot Reinboom here to bring you a look into the thoughts behind the Marksman itemization changes this preseason. :D  
&gt;  
&gt;To jump straight to the point, Marksmen have a number of pain points in the game right now. There\u2019s a distinct lack of individuality between Marksmen. For most, their items are incredibly prescriptive and there\u2019s not a lot of deviation. Generally, as a class, they suffer from high team demands without a lot of self expression to work within those demands.  
&gt;  
&gt;The major thread woven between most of these issues is a distinct lack of meaningful choice.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Meaningful Choice**  
&gt;  
&gt;[We\u2019ve mentioned Meaningful Choice before](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-meaningful-choices).  
&gt;  
&gt;What\u2019s most important here however is the method to achieving meaningful choice (rather than just choice). For Marksman items, we tackled this with three different strategies: \u201cAutonomy\u201d, \u201cReaction\u201d, and \u201cPrediction\u201d.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Autonomy.** Autonomy as a choice is represented by the tradeoff of multiple fantasies (whether they be gameplay fantasies, thematics, or anything you can form a personal attachment to). Feeling attached to Statikk Shiv because you personally value wave clear and are willing to sacrifice your other options for it, is an aspect of autonomy shown in item form.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Reaction.** Reaction as a choice is represented by your capability to solve a problem presented to you. There are multiple types of reaction. For these changes, we\u2019ll be focusing on responses to your opponents in the items they build, the champions they pick, and the needs of your team.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Planning.** Planning as a choice is represented by the tactical and strategic goals you create for individual games. This can be seen by decisions on how you or your team should address each fight (and then building to work within that understanding), or the order for which you build your components, such as getting a Pick Axe to prep for your Last Whisper as you wait for your opponent to inevitably build armor.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Supporting Variety**  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to supporting more options for Marksman, we often run into a difficult problem we call \u201cThe Marksman Damage Optimization Problem.\u201d Marksmans item choices have classically been guided by a very simple and direct point of output: \u201cHow can I do the most damage with the options presented to me?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re operating under the assumption that this problem is fundamental to Marksman and their role within League. There are a number of reasons for this.  
&gt;  
&gt;In games (not just League) single points of optimization, when that point can empower itself, tend to be notably strong. In Marksman\u2019s case, their single point of optimization is damage. This is primarily caused by their damage being reliable via ranged auto-attacks, meaning they can leverage positioning (which is free) as a primary defense.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, we feel like this identity is clear for Marksman. This type of distinct identity allows League to work as a team game, where each individual has their contribution. So in order to support keeping what makes a Marksman a Marksman while still offering choice, we\u2019ll be exploring a different route: While picking up the stats that give Marksman their damage, we should offer choices among those items along the way.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can see this already in the game with the choice posed by Phantom Dancer and Statikk Shiv. Unfortunately, the nuance of this choice can be hard to appreciate (am I behind, or could be behind in gold?), and even then there\u2019s not a lot of these types of selections.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **The Changing Landscape**  
&gt;  
&gt;To wrap it altogether, choices that end up just being damage optimization tests aren\u2019t great. But that\u2019s the expectation of a Marksman. And they have core needs on top of core needs built out of natural consumption of \u201ca lot of different stats.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;The direction we went with to introduce meaningful choice to these restrictions is the idea of \u201chorizontal expansion.\u201d Take the model presented by the current system, and diversify within those bounds. Your options for lifesteal need to be greater than a single item. The items that define a Marksman\u2019s play pattern should expand beyond just \u201cawesome auto attacks.\u201d Your options available for who you can target should be greater than \u201calways buy Last Whisper.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;**Identity**  
&gt;Who am I? Do I autoattack quite a bit? Okay, Infinity Edge. Maybe I autoattack a lot? Infinity Edge. No, seriously, autoattacks are my jam and I will hear nothing less. Fine, Blade of the Ruined King.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not a lot there.  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s a few valid ways of addressing this: we could push more differences between the auto attacks (*insert roster devblog link here*), or we could push some Marksman to be empowered by their abilities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Identity items highlight and specialize the choices you made at champion select. Once again, \u201cWho am I?\u201d We don\u2019t feel like in the current landscape the more caster-like Marksman are well served by this idea. Enter: **Essence Reaver.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Essence Reaver is being changed to offer caster marksman access to a stat they\u2019ve desired, but could never really (or rarely) fully utilize: Cooldown Reduction.  
&gt;  
&gt;Essence Reaver now has the capability to generate you up to 30% Cooldown Reduction by leveraging the Critical Strike Chance available from other Marksman items. We you to feel comfortable making the same damage offers, choices, and expectations from the rest of the Marksman items while being able to uniquely leverage what your champion pick offered.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;**Multiplier**  
&gt;  
&gt;Statikk Shiv or Phantom Dancer. Am I behind or am I ahead?  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s a lot of possible room with these items, except that Phantom Dancer is the poster child for TMDOP (\u201cThe Marksman Damage Optimization Problem,\u201d remember?).  
&gt;  
&gt;So we\u2019re changing that. And we\u2019re widening what it means to be a multiplier item.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to be the damage curve definers, the pointed tip at the end of your two item spike, multipliers are getting an additional identity: \u201cHow should I fight?\u201d This is a choice grounded primarily within autonomy (\u201cWhat works best for me?\u201d) as well as reaction (\u201cWhat works best for my team?\u201d).  
&gt;  
&gt;We divided this choice into four large branches:  
&gt;**Phantom Dancer:** I should skirmish and duel.  
&gt;**Hurricane:** I want to team fight and wombo.  
&gt;**Statikk Shiv:** I must push.  
&gt;**Rapid Firecannon:** I need to siege.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;**Situational Offense**  
&gt;  
&gt;Last Whisper highlights an interesting problem. The usage of total penetration meant that even against champions not buying armor, Last Whisper was actually at least a +10% physical damage amp. This was actually a \u201cgenerally useful\u201d item masquerading under the guise of a tank killer.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to break the above expectations to make selective offense a little less automatic while, at the same time, making it easier to pick up a response when it\u2019s necessary. Selective offensive items are now guided by their components and what you\u2019re giving up, while being significantly more targeted than the current Last Whisper.  
&gt;  
&gt;The components:  
&gt;**Last Whisper:** I need to get through their bonus armor.  
&gt;**Executioner\u2019s Calling:** I need to stuff their life steal or health gain.  
&gt;**Giant Slayer:** I need to climb over their mountain of health.  
&gt;  
&gt;These items can be combined up, with a final selection of which type of selection are you leaving out:  
&gt;**Lord Dominik\u2019s Regards:** A combination of Last Whisper and Giant Slayer  
&gt;**Mortal Reminder: **A combination of Last Whisper and Executioner\u2019s Calling  
&gt;  
&gt;Do note the change from *total* to **bonus armor** penetration, as all of these are still armor pen items at heart. It bears repeating: *we do not want these items to be generalist damage purchases.* This is also why we split the use case of Mortal Reminder (taking out high sustain targets like enemy marksmen, Swain, Mundo, etc) and Lord Dominik\u2019s Regards (tank busting). If you find you don\u2019t need the situational offense these items bring (or nobody\u2019s building any armor!), maybe you can look into picking up another multiplier, or some...  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;**Situational Defense**  
&gt;  
&gt;The key defense favored by Marksman is lifesteal, but there\u2019s not a lot available here so all Marksman default to the same purchase: The Bloodthirster. This stat is so core that it actively pushes aside all other defensive choices until it\u2019s covered.  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re running with that idea. For Marksman, lifesteal means defense. The result is all the items in this category provide *enough* lifesteal before letting you branch into the types of defenses you should otherwise situationally take.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Bloodthirster:** I need to sustain through everything  
&gt;**Death\u2019s Dance:** I need to get burst off me long enough to hit  
&gt;**Mercurial Scimitar:** I need to be free (of CC)  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Going Forward**  
&gt;There\u2019s a lot of new abilities and interactions presented by the changed items, and we don\u2019t believe we have every one of these ironed out.  
&gt;  
&gt;League of Legends hasn\u2019t been tuned to the idea that some Marksman will get 40% Cooldown Reduction, for example, and it\u2019s impossible to know the full effects of this.  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019ll be watching diligently to identify what\u2019s problematic and what\u2019s not!

 **I was really hoping with teambuilder draft, champion hover wouldn't show to the enemy team. It does.**

&gt;Seriously, this should have never existed in the first place. So often it tells the enemy team that you guys are formulating a swap, and want the other champion still.   
&gt;  
&gt;Other times it gives good clues into were you are going with a flexible pick. While this CAN allow for some fun mind games, it adds nothing of value, and detracts quite a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;This really should be removed.

 **Ranked Changes**

&gt;I've seen a few concerns popping up around opening ranked queues to larger premades over the last 24 hours. I want to walk you through why we're making the change in a little more detail. First, I want to say this is the subject of debate internally and it's something we're going to be watching closely to see how it plays out over the preseason. That in mind, the argument really comes down to the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;First, when we looked at your feedback around the issues with ranked queues, we saw a pattern:  
&gt;  
&gt;"I had a leaver in my game, resulting in me getting demoted"  
&gt;"I ran into a rager who ruined my promotions"  
&gt;"I'm bronze V because these noobs I'm getting matched with"  
&gt;  
&gt;What's the pattern? As a player, I didn't have control of who I was playing with in a highly competitive environment resulting in misaligned competitive intentions. We've built systems to address many of these issues, but ultimately we realized we had hit diminishing returns without implementing more fundamental changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, ranked standing currently is a reflection of your ability as an individual to carry in a team game. We of course believe great play should be recognized and rewarded and it should be the foundation of ranked standing, along with team work. Right now ranked standing is far more representative of personal mastery than teamwork. This is why when you look at solo queue the games are so different from high level team games. When we looked at this pattern, we asked ourselves why it should be this way. Why should the most authoritative standing of your abilities in a team game be a rating that requires you explicitly not play as a team?  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, we just straight up asked players if they wanted the change via a large scale feedback tool. A small number of players were strongly opposed, the vast majority of players were in favor or strongly in favor. This doesn't make it the right decision, but it was a data point we considered an important part of the picture.  
&gt;  
&gt;We believe this change will reshape behavior around the ranked experience and we're excited to see what happens during the preseason. Change is scary, and we realize this is a big change. As the stewards of ranked we are going to be analyzing the hell out of the data we get during the preseason to make sure this is a step forward for the game.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the open minded and the skeptics alike: we look forward to seeing what happens in the preseason and to hearing your feedback.

 **Q&amp;A about Dynamic Queues and new Champ Select**

&gt;Hey,  
&gt;  
&gt;A bunch of team members are all over social media answering questions about Dynamic Queues and new Champ Select, but going to gather everyone here to help answer questions too because it's hard to keep tracking of Reddit threads, and Twitter/Ask.fm is hard to have conversations on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's my initial posts about Dynamic Queues, so let's start here!  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;We knew Dynamic Queue was going to be a controversial topic. If you check my accounts over the seasons, I've played over 5000 Ranked Solo/Duo Queue games, and about 4800 of those are pure solo. Other team members like RiotSocrates, RiotChomey, ryedan, and RiotTantram... we're all Platinum, Diamond or higher and pure soloists. Because we *are* the advocates for solo players, this is also why we're the best team to build the new Champ Select and Dynamic Queues.  
&gt;  
&gt;When we first started building the new Champ Select, we knew this would be a big debate. In every research survey, the majority of players wanted to try Ranked, but also wanted to play with friends and did not have enough friends always online to play Ranked Teams. In every analytics report, the more friends you play with on average, the better your experiences and the less toxicity there is. We looked to other popular games and it was very hit-or-miss. Non-MOBAs have historically rewarded group play with more opportunities and better rewards (such as WoW, where the entire end-game is based on group play and you are forced to group up to get the best loot). Competitive PvP games, however, were split. HOTS and LoL were most recently Solo/Duo Queue, but CS:GO has Dynamic Queue, and DOTA2 has a hybrid Dynamic Queue. When we looked into this, the *reason* every game chose their approach was for different reasons. For some, it was size of their playerbase, some were forced to because of how their matchmakers were designed. For Riot, League is a competitive team sport. Playing with friends allows you to try more strategies, and the more organized play there is, the more competitive the entire ecosystem becomes. By playing with friends, it becomes much easier to organize a rotation strategy, a knock-up comp, or double jungler invade strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;So, we had to make a super risky, super difficult choice. We--a team with a bunch of solo purists--had to try to make Dynamic Queue a great experience. We started by adding a bunch of features and looking at premade data:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) We upgraded the matchmaking system to pair similar group comps together. It is possible that it might be *harder* to rank up in a premade group than as a solo because you'll be consistently exposed to crazier, and more competitive strategies.  
&gt;  
&gt;2) We changed the Ban System to something we call "Distributed Bans." By giving Players 3, 4, and 5 one ban each, and giving Players 1 and 2 first and second pick, we've given every player a meaningful choice in Champ Select and this "leverage" reduces a lot of toxicity in our research labs. Basically, the premade of 4 doesn't want to lose LP either, and in every game, the random solo has a lot of power in Champ Select.  
&gt;  
&gt;3) As you may have noticed, we've beefed up the Report System, and added new features to the Instant Feedback System. More than ever before, Premade 4s won't be able to "affect" your account if they simply gang up and try to bully you with reports. In fact, if they do this often and they file False reports, they can be banned for this behavior. Secondly, in a Premade 4 situation, your reports are just as powerful as the group, so if they are showing toxic behaviors at all, your single report can have a meaningful impact and trigger a punishment. We believe measures like this will help balance out this specific scenario to be less negative.  
&gt;  
&gt;4) There's actually a pretty big perception issue with premades in League. When I talk to players, they always remember the premade that bullied them or made the game more toxic; however, when I point out behind the scenes and show them the data that almost every single Ranked game has a Duo Queue in it... they are shocked. The perception problem is that you only remember the games where a premade did have an issue, but you never remember the games where they were quiet and just didn't give away they were a premade. We've been measuring toxicity in premade combinations for awhile now and believe that most most combinations of premade 2s and 3s are fine, and premade 4s have a little bit more toxicity than we'd like. Premade 5s are obviously awesome experiences. So what are we doing about premade 4s?  
&gt;  
&gt;Like any big change, we're going to have to monitor this one carefully. We ask you guys to be patient and give it a chance. We'll ultimately make the right decision, but a LOT of players have voiced their opinions that they do want a more social Ranked experience and want to play in a Dynamic Ranked queue.   
&gt;  
&gt;Contrary to what some players may believe, we've made hundreds of changes to Champ Select and Ranked Improvements already during development due to feedback and nothing is set in stone--it's possible that Dynamic Queues aren't a great experience. If that's the case, we'll pivot. But, right now the data suggests **A LOT** more players want Dynamic Queues than not and Premade 4s are nowhere near as toxic as players are making it out to be with our tier restriction and matchmaking systems in place. We just have to figure out how to make this a great experience for groups *and* reduce some of the frustration solo purists are feeling. We're going to try everything we can to make Dynamic Queue a great experience. Give it a chance, and we're listening if it doesn't work.

 **A Struggling AD Carry**

&gt;Hey guys!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm Rat with a Hat, jungler main with a secondary around AD Carry. Recently, I've been playing a decent amount of ranked, and have been losing quite a bit. And ZOMG my teammates are all so bad! Like how can I be matched with such noobs like I deserve better than this I'm the next Doublelift, GIVE ME CHALLENGER!  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok now let's actually talk. Recently, I've been noticing that I have been extremely inefficient with my time as an AD Carry. My farm has been sub-par (getting like 6-7 CS per minute) and I haven't been dealing much damage in fights (usually 10-15k down the other AD carry and 2nd to 3rd best on my team). I feel like I'm just using my time extremely inefficiently and could spend more time farming to get items or more time team fighting to... well, team fight.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, I'm here to ask anyone if they have any tips they can give me to help me work on where I should be on the map at which times and what to think about when thinking about where I should be. Thanks a ton in advance!  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR: I suck at ADC. Tips on macro-level decision making?

 **Leona mini rework idea.**

&gt;Context: Just got out of a great Tank Top Leona game and started looking at champions in LoL, I noticed that most tank champions are restricted to a single role due to huge issues, for example Tank Top Leona suffers from not having a passive, poor CS ability and mana issues, which further contribute to her poor CS ability. I think looking at Leona as a tank rather than a support is a really good idea, especially with how fun she is and how not fun being gold/exp starved as a support is. At any rate I started thinking and came up with a great rework idea.  
&gt;  
&gt;Passive: Solar Powered  
&gt;When Leona is in range of allied turrets or wards she becomes Solar Powered and her auto attacks deal 10/40/70/100 magic damage (upgrades at 6, 11, and 16) additionally Leona restores 3/6/9/12 mana per second. (This passive would help her not get bullied in top lane, as well as adding to her CS ability. Fixing all her major issues in one change, leaving just normal weaknesses)  
&gt;  
&gt;E: Mana cost increased to 80 from 60.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Mana cost increased to 120/130/140 from 100 at all levels

 **Season 6, the rise of the elo boost.**

&gt;ATM, the most efficient way to elo boost an account is to actually elo boost two accounts at the same time.   
&gt;(This allows for more games won because you have 2 Master players that can and will carry every game below Diamond)  
&gt;  
&gt;With this new 5v5 premade ranked, you can get 5 Master players elo boosting 5 bronze accounts, and the entire journey will be a cake walk (its easier and faster to carry 4 master players that are all in a skype chat, than it is 3 bronze, silver, gold, platinum, or diamond players that barely acknowledge your existence).   
&gt;They will win every game.    
&gt;  
&gt;So what does this mean?   
&gt;  
&gt;Well, this allows even more people to Elo boost. If everyone is on the same page, 4 Platinum players and 1 Master/Diamond player can very easily carry accounts to Low diamond(with some struggle, and especially high Plat with no real struggle let alone Gold V).  
&gt;  
&gt;Usually accounts like to get elo boosted to Gold V (I presume because that is when you get season rewards)  
&gt;  
&gt;TLDR: More Elo boosters, more elo boosting, and a cluster fuck in Gold V

 **New Masteries - Build Tips and Theory Crafting**

&gt;Hey all!  
&gt;  
&gt;First, if you haven't already, go check out [this player-made mastery calculator](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/)! I'll be using this tool to link pages. Special thanks to Hudzen, DPatti, and Pyro for their work on it over the seasons - you guys are all awesome.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, let's get into it. I understand that the new mastery system can be hard to get a feel for, so I wanted to get a few template-esque pages out there to help get everyone started. So, check out the links and associated champions below, and let me know what you think about these recommendations! And of course, please share some pages of your own :D  
&gt;  
&gt;Note: These are only intended as guidelines and should be just enough to get you started -- I'll leave the real theory-crafting / optimizing to you guys! I **DO NOT** want to prescribe your build, and rarely will there be a single optimal build, but if you're feeling particularly overwhelmed, feel free to lean on what's here until you figure out your own way!  
&gt;  
&gt;--------------------------------------------------------  
&gt;  
&gt;* [12-18-0 Aggressive Jungler](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#ClK0yK0CvCvKY)  
&gt; * {{champion:60}} {{champion:121}}  {{champion:64}}   
&gt; * These assassin types will love the pen and burst damage offered by the Cunning Tree [hello, Thunderlord's Decree!], paired with the more general damage amps offered by the Ferocity Tree. Savagery and Runic Affinity from the Cunning tree also really help out in the jungle.  
&gt; * If the early clear proves to be too challenging ({{champion:28}} ), opting into a safer [0-18-12](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#YK0CvCvKCvCly) setup might be the way to go.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* [12-0-18 Brawler](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#KxCvyYCvKxClK)  
&gt; * {{champion:122}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:2}}   
&gt; * These juggernauts really benefit from the Grasp of the Undying mastery in the Resolve Tree. It turns their already high-health builds into more damage and sustain, allowing them to slog through the fight, dishing out and soaking up tons of damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* [0-12-18 Peel Tank](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#YKxKxyCvKxK2v)  
&gt; * {{champion:201}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}}   
&gt; * If soaking up damage for your allies is more your thing, check out Bond of Stone in the Resolve Tree, and pick up some self healing and mana regeneration so you can keep yourself topped off while you protect your carries!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* [0-18-12 Utility Support](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#YCvK0K2vClCly)  
&gt; * {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}}   
&gt; * Windspeaker's blessing in the Cunning Tree multiplies the power of these more buff/heal-centric supports. In addition, picking up Secret Stash and Meditation will give their lane some serious staying power.  
&gt; * That said, swapping those 12 points into Ferocity, and selecting Thunderlord's Decree as your keystone will give you some potent trading potential in lane. I encourage you to choose based on your own playstyle and preference!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* [18-12-0 Sustained Damage Caster](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#KxKxK2vK0KxyY)   
&gt; * {{champion:115}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:268}}   
&gt; * When you're not just trying to one-shot someone, Deathfire Touch and co. from the Feroicty Tree will really amp up your damage over long periods of time, and the mana regeneration from the Cunning Tree will give you the resources to make it work.  
&gt; * When you ARE looking to one-shot someone (I'm looking at you guys: {{champion:45}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:99}} ) , I'd recommend [12-18-0](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#K0KxyCvCvCvKY) instead!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;* [18-0-12 Marksman](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#CvCvCvKYCvCly)  
&gt; * Ferocity suits the playstyle of most marksmen -- Lifesteal and %armor pen? Sign 'em up!   
&gt; * Certain champions will inevitably make better use of certain keystones, but Marksmen should be able to viably run any of these keystones, depending on their preferred playstyles.   
&gt;   * Do you like to poke with spells? Check out Deathfire Touch {{champion:110}}  
&gt;   * Is harassing with basic attacks more your thing? You'll enjoy Fervor of Battle {{champion:51}}  
&gt;   * More into heavy Crit/AD builds? Warlord's Bloodlust can shore up your lifesteal and attack speed so you can focus on your core stats {{champion:119}}  
&gt; * Some marksmen might opt into something like  [18-12-0](http://pyroblasty.github.io/masteries/#CvCvCvKK0CvyY) for maximum damage, but I find passing up the laning defenses in the Resolve Tree too costly, personally ;)  
&gt;  
&gt;-----------------------------------  
&gt;  
&gt;Alright! That's all from me. I left out a number of archtypes, like the light-fighting skirmishers {{champion:114}} {{champion:157}} , bulky divers {{champion:254}} {{champion:5}} , and many more. Plus, many champions will have particularly unique set-ups, based on their kit, so I encourage you to break out of the molds I outlined above!

[widd wrote on 2015-11-05 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/uEvIgWuE-ranked-changes?comment=0025):

&gt;**tl;dr: The new changes are bad because they assume that Ranked Solo Queue is a measurement of individual skill when in reality it is a measurement of overall ability to perform consistently well in a team environment, which is a much larger spectrum of various skills together INCLUDING individual skill.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A preface to my post:   
&gt;  
&gt;I'm what most players/Riot would consider a toxic player. I've been temp-banned repeatedly and been chat restricted numerous times because of my in-game behavior concerning the performance of my teammates.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would love NOTHING more than to have the random players who are likely to infuriate me never be on a team with me. It would be great to just queue with 4 friends and pubstomp through every division. In fact, if a Rioter would be comfortable with it, I encourage them to view some of my negative chat logs or maybe even post them in response to this just so a general idea of how pissed I get when my team does not perform up to my expectations because of my insanely intense desire to win (even in normals).  
&gt;  
&gt;If there is anybody who would benefit from being able to queue only with friends in ranked, it would be me and others like me.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**I still think almost all of these changes are absolutely absurd and extremely detrimental to the game in the current context.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Here's how I'm interpreting your explanation/Riot's reasoning for the changes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Relying on 4 other unknown players is not considered a True measure of **individual **skill.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Ranked Solo Queue is a representation of your **individual** skill, which conflicts with the above and necessitates change.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. All gameplay experiences should be streamlined to be easier to use, clearer, and more friendly.  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Here are my issues with such reasoning (not the proposed changes themselves):**  
&gt;  
&gt;1. League of Legends is a team-based game. The notion that Ranked Solo Queue is a measure of individual skill is a misconception.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Ranked Solo Queue _should_ be known as a measurement of your ability to play consistently well in a team environment regardless of unknown variables. This is where the perceived purpose of Ranked Solo Queue and its actual purpose come into conflict.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Individual skill in a team-based game is a secondary priority in a competitive context.  
&gt;  
&gt;The actual changes themselves are irrelevant when they are created with the above in mind.  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**What can possibly be done to achieve a better player experience while also keeping in line with Riot's goals with the currently proposed changes:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**_In general: _**  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not shoehorn changes geared toward individual skill into Ranked Solo Queue. There is already a system in place for measuring individual performance: Champion Mastery. If players want to be recognized for their sole contributions to a match, it should be through Champion Mastery's post-game grading system. Flesh it out more; maybe some sort of overall average grade that is displayed similarly to your ranked league and division (ie "wow that guy's got an average of S+ he must do well really often/have good mechanics/be good in 1v1s").   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**_Regarding a dynamic queue:_**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While a dynamic queue system is not inherently good or bad, the details of how League of Legends works as a game pose problems with it. If a more streamlined overall queue experience is the goal, you must place restrictions on it to avoid extremely unfair match-ups. A quick suggestion would be to disallow 4-man premades entirely so that solo players cannot be placed on a team with diminished communication. This way, 5s will only be matched with 5s, 3s will only be put on a team with 2s and matched with another team with 3/2, etc. You can still get the friendly ranked experience with minimal impact on the minority that would be negatively affected by larger premades being on or against their team. 5 man premades being allowed is still up for debate as they should only be matched against other 5s, however I see that as pointless because that's what Ranked Teams are for.  
&gt;  
&gt;I personally think that a dynamic queue would actually improve the experience of Ranked Solo Queue as long as it is implemented correctly, but it is a very daunting task and you should be very cautious. It will only be the right decision when no player is affected negatively by the changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**_Ranked Solo Queue vs. Individual Performance/Skill:_**  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently Ranked Solo Queue operates in a fashion where ranking is determined by how well a player can perform consistently and independently of all other variables (such as teammates' performance). This encompasses individual performance/skill (mechanics, laning, etc) and how well they can impact the state of their team through various means (e.g. winning your lane vs helping win other lanes/taking objectives). The complaints that you cite are related to the belief that Ranked Solo Queue is supposed to determine only individual skill; players complaining that their team drags them down, that their promos were ruined by somebody who fed and raged, etc. This is simply not True and needs to be reinforced as the key to what Ranked Solo Queue is for: ranking players based on how much they can play like a coordinated team with strangers.   
&gt;  
&gt;Clarify what Ranked Solo Queue is for and how it works beyond the technical aspects. Make resources available to show players that it's not for determining how well you can play in a lane or with a certain champion, but how well you can impact the game with your decisions and gameplay no matter what situation you are presented with. Diffuse ranked stress with reassurances that team oriented decision making is what impacts your ranking the most, not how much your teammates feed, how little you die to enemies, or how many kills/towers/dragons you get by yourself. This has already been addressed before, but not reinforced like it should be. The message should be that in Ranked Solo Queue, [not only is Teamwork OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugXC7g3p0JU), but how much successful team play you can facilitate is also essentially indirectly equivalent to your rank (rather than wins == rank, while teamwork is a tool for winning).  
&gt;  
&gt;\u00a0  
&gt;  
&gt;**Please take these concerns, suggestions, and explanations into consideration. As one of the players who is frustrated and complains a lot with the exact same complaints you cited, I do _NOT_ want these changes to go to live without major overhauls.**

&gt;After using empowered Q, Ashe will no longer always crit on autoattacks, but instead crits like any normal champion. When she crits, it is still for the modified damage (110% + crit chance) instead of 200% damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;To reproduce:  
&gt;1) Play as Ashe  
&gt;2) Use Q with 5 stacks  
&gt;3) Observe that you no longer crit 100% of the time after the Q duration ends

As seen in the video, a thresh flay isn't always blocked by Sivir's Shield, with the shield popping but resulting in damage still being taken and the flay effect still working, i.e. Sivir is flayed towards Thresh.  This only seems to work when being flayed towards Thresh (not tested thoroughly).

 **There's a slightly significant nerf to Janna on PBE that I don't think anyone's noticed.**

&gt;  
&gt;___  
&gt;  
&gt;Turrets have nearly doubled HP on the PBE, going from 2000/2300/2300/2500 to 3500/3500/4000/4000 for tier 1/2/Inhibitor/Nexus turrets respectively, while they all went from 100 armor and MR to 0 of both. As 100 armor or MR is exactly 50% damage reduction, turrets are only slightly squishier. This a good change for clarity - towers now take exactly as much damage as one deals them, while the changes have fewer consequences than you\u2019d think. Unlike monsters, turrets have an equal amount of armor and MR, so this doesn\u2019t change relative effectiveness of physical or magic damage against them, and they are also immune to all forms of penetration, so armor pen is no more or less effective against them. However, it does have few subtler interactions. The flat 30 damage reduction towers get against attacks before 7 minutes was applied after armor, so it is much less effective now, and thus towers are much easier to take early. The 200 armor and MR towers get while no enemy minions is noticeably more effective; while 300 armor takes half the damage 100 armor does, 200 armor takes a third the damage 0 armor does. This works out to turrets taking 8000/9200/9200/12000 pre-mitigation damage on live vs 10500/10500/12000/12000 on PBE, so nexus turrets are just as difficult to take without minions, while all other towers are harder on PBE. _**Of note, because turrets now has half the damage reduction, Janna\u2019s shield on them now breaks twice as easily. There\u2019s yet another change - the ratio that AP damages towers has been increased to .5 from .4, so AP champions can take towers easily**_.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that while AP Janna can't defend turrets as effectively, she can now take turrets like a boss! At level 18, with 102 Base AD and 700 AP with a Lich bane, her empowered auto will do (102 + 700 x .5) +(102 x .75 + 700 x .5) = 452 physical + 426.5 Magic =** 878.5 Damage**, just over a quarter of a t1 or t2 turret's HP. But wait! She can shield herself for 50 + (700 x .1) = 120 bonus AD, and ready another lich bane proc, for... 878.5 damage again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Turns out the bonus from AP overrides the effect of your bonus AD if its higher, and vise versa. Hybrid champions have always been punished by this, but at least now it\u2019s more readable - the number you see when you hit a turret should be the higher of either exactly 100% of your total AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP, and Spell Blade if you have it, of course. I guess Jax doesn't really need any help taking towers, but I've always been disappointed hybrid champs will never reach the capabilities of marksmen, or their AP counterparts,  at taking towers because of this.  
&gt;  
&gt;_**Zeepy (or is it Zeepeh?), I'm expecting a video**_

 **As a Diamond, Silver elo is surprisingly hard.**

&gt;So I've been playing on a Silver account recently since I got my main account to Diamond for the season and I'm really shocked at how difficult Silver elo is. The games are really inconsistent as far as team work and people knowing what to do. Some players feel like they know exactly what to do and lane / last hit really well and I'm surprised they're in silver, and then there's others that I'm shocked have even made it this far.   
&gt;  
&gt;People feed out of control here. In Diamond if someone loses lane they die at most 2 times, and that's still a lot. In Silver, people don't seem to understand that if they died fighting once, it only gets harder to win and keep trying, and its not uncommon to see 7-9 deaths coming out of laning phase. Having players on the enemy team fed that much makes carrying hard, even if I win my lane every time or have a ton of successful ganks jungling. There also seems to be a disproportionate amount of AFKs here.   
&gt;  
&gt;It feels like the best way to win here is to just stomp your lane and split push. Team fighting is a crap shoot, people are uncoordinated, don't follow up, and engaging is a huge risk because you may engage and only have 1-2 people follow up, or attack the wrong targets. If I don't HARD carry, IE 10+ kills before 20 minutes, and things go to the late game team fighting phase, I get a little nervous because its kind of a dice roll on how the fights will go. Its different in Diamond because you can make smart plays and expect people to be on board but here you really can't trust your team to follow up on things, so doing things like going full tank seems like a bad idea because a lot of the time you gotta do all the work yourself. Its a completely different meta than higher up.   
&gt;  
&gt;I was a little embarassed about the struggle here so I mentioned it in a group and a bunch of other Diamond / Master level players were having the same issues. I felt a little relieved to find that out but at the same time, it makes me wonder about skill in this game when players that have consistently proven themselves to be able to play at a high level struggle at this low of an elo.   
&gt;  
&gt;So for all the players grinding out of Silver that are frustrated with the climb. Don't feel bad. It really does suck down here. Take it from a Diamond.

 **A Reply to Riot Socrates on Dynamic Groups**

&gt;It isn't very often that I feel like putting in the effort to reply in detail to something written by a rioter, and further this is the first time I have put time into crafting a reply that I feel deserves to be its own thread.   
&gt;  
&gt;Personally I believe that some of the philosophy underpinning the the justification for introducing ranked dynamic groups into solo queue ranking is flawed.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;Next, ranked standing currently is a reflection of your ability as an individual to carry in a team game. We of course believe great play should be recognized and rewarded and it should be the foundation of ranked standing, along with team work. Right now ranked standing is far more representative of personal mastery than teamwork.   
&gt;  
&gt;Just to highlight this from your quote: **ranked standing currently is a reflection of your ability as an individual to carry in a team game.**  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a very undeveloped statement. Actually ranked-standing is a measure of your decision-making abilities as a player (both in lane and out of lane). The higher ranked a player is, the greater is their understanding of many teamwork related decisions. Such as: When to roam from your lane, when to group as 5, when you can safely split-push because your team is capable of resisting dives, when is a good time to gank for a team mate to get them back into the game, when it is actually better to get your team the gold for an outer turret rather than to deny your opposing laner etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a great deal of respect for streamers like Valkrin, Boxerpete, Wings and quite a few other high ranked players who give commentary on why they are making the decisions they are making at that point. It is rare that you hear them making decisions without considering the effect of those decisions on the team.   
&gt;  
&gt;What I have said previously means that the following statement of yours **We of course believe great play should be recognized and rewarded and it should be the foundation of ranked standing, along with team work.** is currently True for SoloQ and DuoQ(to a lesser extent in the worst member of the Duo). When players climb the ladder right now, they have to develop the teamwork related decision-making skills or they won't climb.  
&gt;  
&gt;I will tell you now that the reason I am in Gold 2 is because I have to develop my teamwork related decision-making which is not currently worthy to get to me to diamond.   
&gt;  
&gt;Personal mastery in league of legends includes your teamwork related decision-making skills. Therefore, currently your ranked-standing is actually a reflection of your ability to work with your team.   
&gt;  
&gt;You further said.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;This is why when you look at solo queue the games are so different from high level team games. When we looked at this pattern, we asked ourselves why it should be this way.   
&gt;  
&gt;There are a whole bunch of reasons why high-level games are different from solo Q games.   
&gt;  
&gt;The first is that Teams don't play underpowered (or their powers are non-useful in 5s) champions like Teemo, Tryndamere, Heimerdinger and others because they won't take the risk that the weaknesses of those champions will get exploited by the other teams. SoloQ games have one trick ponies who love those champions and play them a lot so one major difference is that high-level games operate from a smaller champion pool than Solo Q.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, teams prepare their team compositions beforehand and prepare a few different picks for each situation. Pick and Ban's for the high level ranked5s to LCS and worlds is its own science. High ranked solo queue players do to a certain extent pick to the teamcomp but it isn't as important as it is in very high level games and I don't think you want nearly have your champions to have a pickrate of 0% because now everyone is forced to pick the strongest champions and strongest team-compositions or automatically lose.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirdly, High Level games have Callers with voice chat. I would almost argue that the use of voice chat alone explains the difference between SoloQ and High Level ranked5s+ games. Without the use of voice-chat dynamic groups will never approach the precision of high level games.   
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;   
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;Why should the most authoritative standing of your abilities in a team game be a rating that requires you explicitly not play as a team?  
&gt;  
&gt;This last conclusion of yours is demonstrably False from the arguments I have previously provided.   
&gt;  
&gt;What is actually going to occur with dynamic groups is that a lot of players will not develop the decision-making skills that relate to playing with a team. This is because dynamic groups may gravitate towards using voice chat and will end up with one or two players making the important decisions.   
&gt;  
&gt;This means that some players will develop great decision-making skills with respect to calling what their team ought to do. And then some players will have most of their decisions micromanaged by their diamond rated team decison-maker. The caller will be syaing things like, go here, clear the wave, back off, don't go there etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;So whatever proportion of players will end up gaining their MMR and LP through being able to follow the shotcalls of a good player will not be worth their rank.   
&gt;  
&gt;Just to re-write your conclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why should the most authoritative standing of your (decision-making) abilities in a team-game be rating gained from playing in a mode that doesn't require you to learn how to make better teamwork related decions?**  
&gt;  
&gt;This by the way is actually why there are low ranked solo Q players who can play well in ranked 5s. This is because they lane well, and they are good at following the voice of their teams shotcaller. They and their team deserve their teamrank in ranked 5s, but as an individual player they don't deserve to be higher ranked in solo Q until they develop their own decision-making skills. This fundamentally is the reason why Dynamic Groups will devalue people's solo Q rating.   
&gt;  
&gt;If I get to Diamond next year, I want it to be recognised that it is because I have developed my understanding of the game. I want it to be because I have learned how to make better team-related decisions so I group and roam efficiently, not to mention be able to recognise when my team is actually going to be better of with me creating pressure elsewhere on the map. I will be sad if this development will be devalued by the people who gained the same rank by being carried by a dynamic group with a diamond level shotcaller. All Dynamic Groups will have done is legalised a form of boosting, because some proportion of those players will not be able to play at that level.   
&gt;  
&gt;Not to mention the fact that boosters themselves will have a field day. 5 master-level boosters playing on the same set of silver accounts will make the experience of other 5 man groups on the way up whatever the required rank is miserable.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that people want to play ranked with their friends to avoid toxicity. However, now that a major reason for toxicity has been removed via the new Queueing system, (Thank you by the way for no more Mid or Feed trolls) why don't you let those players give that system a chance before you devalue the solo Q ranked system entirely.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reading,  
&gt;  
&gt;Your's sincerely  
&gt;  
&gt;Paulus

 **[DEV BLOG] Starting Items in the 2016 Season**

&gt;Posting for **Xypherous!**  
&gt;  
&gt;Our original intent with starting items before this season was to give players the ability to reflexively counter their opponents with generalist options running alongside more pronounced counter-items for specific circumstances (Flask, Doran\u2019s Shield).   
&gt;  
&gt;However, after a couple of seasons of attempting to balance this world, we\u2019ve grown unhappy with how confining this approach is and the general problems that resulted from this approach. We\u2019re decided to take a different tactic and adopt a pattern closer to the support line of items: Starter items that clearly express some kind of goal or intent in lane alongside a more generalist item for each of the positions in the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Magic** - Doran\u2019s Ring vs. The Dark Seal  
&gt;  
&gt;Doran\u2019s Ring is a powerful farming generalist item while The Dark Seal signifies an intent to roam and pick up champion kills along the the way.   
&gt;  
&gt;While this doesn\u2019t support the full spectrum of mages in mid, it does represent two of the largest factions - push mages vs. assassin roamers.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Attack** - Cull vs. Doran\u2019s Blade  
&gt;  
&gt;Cull is an early skirmish option designed to be focused primarily around farming and light aggression.   
&gt;  
&gt;Doran\u2019s Blade on the other hand, is a generalist option that scales much better into mid-game and is better in skirmish situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jungle** - Hunter\u2019s Talisman vs. Hunter\u2019s Machete  
&gt;  
&gt;Machete has long favored a certain class of attack speed centric characters and this represents a quandary of how to actually support mage or tank style junglers from the get-go.   
&gt;  
&gt;Machete now doubles down on its auto-attack centric nature while Talisman focuses on area burn and mana regeneration. Talisman is primarily designed for spell focused junglers - especially those that have repeated area of effect attacks on moderate cooldowns (like Brand or Zyra).  
&gt;  
&gt;Both of these initial items are required to upgrade into the Tier 2 Jungle item, so your choice of initial item will eventually become moot. However, this flexibility of starting options combined with the patience system should open up stronger opening jungle patterns to a wider variety of junglers.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Lane Sustain** - Health Potion vs. Refillable Potion  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the major issues with Crystalline Flask right now is that we are unable to push its power to the point where it feels non-abusive in lane. This is due to the fact that it stacks with potions and thus any power add-on in Crystalline Flask gets doubled down on because you stack potions with it.   
&gt;  
&gt;Hence, the new inventory rule: you can only ever have one type of potion in your inventory at any time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Refillable Potions are 3 times more expensive than a potion but benefit from the fact that they will recharge once you return to the fountain. Normal Healing Potions represent more healing up-front for less gold but is obviously temporary in nature.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Refillable Upgrades** - Jungle vs. Lane  
&gt;  
&gt;This, by itself, would probably still be on the weak side. However, Refillable Potions can upgrade into two versions: Hunter\u2019s Potion and Corrupting Potion.   
&gt;  
&gt;Hunter\u2019s Potion is a roam-centric potion that can regain charges out in the field while you are killing large jungle monsters. It\u2019s designed primarily to support a Jungle playstyle that focuses on maximal uptime or bolstering characters with low innate sustain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Corrupting Potion is similar to Crystalline Flask on live - with the added benefit of combat power. During its effect, damaging enemy champions will burn them for magic damage over time. Corrupting Potion represents an intent to harass your lane opponent until they give up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mana Potions** - Removed  
&gt;  
&gt;Mana Potions have been removed from the game. We\u2019ve generally found that the decision to opt into Mana Potions was one that was either forced upon some champions (aka \u201cI need this mana to function\u201d) or one that was generally only available to a handful of circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;The best use cases of Mana Potions were typically to circumvent Mana restrictions for boom/bust play patterns (ie: save up to X amount of mana before dumping it all in a large burst of damage, repeat) vs. attrition-based approaches that are more in favor of straight mana regeneration. A champion being able to access their big \u201call-in\u201d combo more frequently also makes it challenging for us to balance appropriately, and we\u2019ve seen some more frustrating champions have their power reduced as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the removal of mana potions, we can also retune some champion mana values back to a middle ground. We\u2019ve looked at the data for champions that frequently bought 2 or more mana potions in the game and we\u2019ve either increased their maximum mana or the mana regeneration values based on their class.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Closing**  
&gt;  
&gt;For the start of the season, we\u2019ve focused on granting at least two options to a particular need in the starting item space to support a wider variety of playstyles and intents from the start of the game.

 **[DEV BLOG] Vision in the 2016 Season**

&gt;Posting for **Xypherous!**  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019ve generally been happy with some of the new vision mechanics in the game with the advent of Season 5. However, as the vision system has grown organically over time, the map has become increasingly brighter and brighter since Season 4.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the amount of unused trinkets and profusion of various vision types made it hard to consider expansions onto an already bloated system so this Season will mostly focus around concentrating the vision game to fewer discrete points.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:2044}}   
&gt;  
&gt;First off, we\u2019ve removed Green Wards. This is a pretty big sledgehammer to vision overall and the map is significantly darker because of it. We heard a lot of feedback on this and I wanted to give more context:  
&gt;  
&gt;When vision is in a \u201cconsumable\u201d state, it does a few things to the game that we want to change. First, because map knowledge is so powerful, the ideal state of vision for two teams is basically \u201cas much as you can.\u201d That means that teams will be perpetually funneling their excess gold (or in the case of supports and some junglers, their core gold income) into as much vision upkeep as possible. The compelling decision of *when* to ward and *where* to ward gets flattened.   
&gt;  
&gt;For supports, engaging so heavily with the vision system means they\u2019ll often need to give up late-game purchases and slot efficiency to ensure the map is well lit. For others, it becomes a gold dump to push an advantage. By taking all \u2018safe\u2019 vision (invisible wards) out of the gold stream and placing them on meaningfully gated cooldowns, teams will have to think a lot more about where they want to set up on the map, rather than it being a given luxury for who can do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to the removal of Green Wards, we\u2019re also doing the following changes:  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:2043}}   
&gt;  
&gt;Pink Wards will still remain buyable and represent an investment into permanent vision control over an area. They\u2019re also slightly cheaper and fall into Sight Ward\u2019s original cost range.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Trinkets**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Trinket System has been streamlined down to 2 basic options, plus 2 \u201calterations\u201d that become available at Level 9. Trinkets also now continuously improve with level rather than at discrete levels in the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3361}}   
&gt;  
&gt;**Warding Totem** will now behave like the upgraded **Warding Totem** on live which slowly charges up to store additional wards. The duration and charges have been tweaked to increase continuously with character level.   
&gt;  
&gt;We like the flexibility and general gameplay of the upgraded trinket as it allows you to maintain vision over a small area for a long time or tactically cover a wide area by yourself if you\u2019ve built up charges over time - giving it a much wider range of potential uses.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3341}}   
&gt;  
&gt;**Sweeping Lens** has taken a hit in power now that there aren\u2019t potentially green wards everywhere.   
&gt;  
&gt;To compensate, red gains the ability to warn against things that you can\u2019t see in the area letting you know the shape or silhouette of things in fog of war without revealing them directly. This includes things like jungler monsters (check if that camp is up!) and Pink Wards, in addition to providing the silhouette of stealthed threats like champions in brush, fog of war or stealth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweeping Lens\u2019 core functionality becomes alerting you as to whether or not anything in the swept area can detect you and allowing you to disable them.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **\u201cAlterations\u201d**  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of upgrades, which are strictly better than the original trinket that you have, we\u2019ve instead chosen to move in the direction of side-grading and altering existing functionality of trinkets.   
&gt;  
&gt;These swap the functionality of your existing trinket by improving the power of some aspects and decreasing the power in other aspects.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3363}}   
&gt;  
&gt;Yellow Trinket\u2019s alteration - the **Farsight Totem** is unlocked at level 9 and functions similarly to the Farsight Orb on live with some improvements. You gain vastly increased range and a shorter cooldown\u2026 at the expense of having visible wards and losing the ability to build charges.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a departure from live, these \u201cblue\u201d wards now last forever and don\u2019t count towards your ward count. Since these wards are easily destructible by opponents, we don\u2019t foresee this as contributing significantly to the overall vision of the map unless a team decides to use multiple blue trinkets in parallel to light up disparate regions of the map over time.   
&gt;  
&gt;So you can light up the map as long as you do it as part of an ongoing campaign to hold territory for extended periods of time.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3364}}   
&gt;  
&gt;The Sweeping Lens\u2019 alteration - the **Oracle Lens** (also unlocked at 9) - is more tame in comparison and very similar to the Oracle upgrade on live. In lieu of gaining True sight, the red trinket simply has a much wider sweep range and follows you around for 10 seconds.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, combined with the fact that red trinket can warn you against enemy units that you can\u2019t see - this means it will also provide a proximity check so you don\u2019t walk headlong into an enemy ward or brush.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Closing**  
&gt;  
&gt;Vision remains an important key strategic strength in League of Legends. The current vision system has a ton of small moving parts, as well as a few mechanics that just make the system kind of obtuse to interact with.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to streamline the existing vision items to a smaller core set of vision items while also allowing that core to branch out in interesting directions and overlapping functions. Overall, the power in vision should be more condensed in the options that remain.   
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re taking advantage of the overall reduction in small vision buys to offer more interesting total item build options in the form of the Sightstone upgrades or the Jungle enchantments. Our goal was not to make the overall vision experience more complicated, but allow vision options to form the basis for more interesting total builds. From the support who forgoes his actives in favor of a powerful AP build, to the support who doubles down on active items, to the Jungler who forgoes combat in favor of map wide vision and utility.

 **[DEV BLOG] Marksman Update in the 2016 Season**

&gt;Champion Update team here! While you\u2019ve probably already seen the big changes due for marksmen (if you haven\u2019t, check it all out here http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html ), we wanted to set aside a moment for a deeper dive. The new marksmen update comes hot on the heels of the juggernauts update ( http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/gameplay-update-juggernauts ) and, with so much changing so fast, we think it\u2019s a good idea to pause for a more philosophical reflection.   
&gt;  
&gt;But first, a quick look back.  
&gt;  
&gt;When we set out to tackle the juggernauts, we were working with a whole lot of unknowns. This was a set of champions that didn\u2019t have much in the way of strategic identity. By really highlighting their strengths, we gave them clear ways to succeed (and fail) in an unfamiliar environment. Making something from nothing is a really interesting space to work in and we think we\u2019ve achieved our philosophical goal with many of them. The tricky bit, however, was calibrating the juggernaut\u2019s appropriate weaknesses against their raw power.  
&gt;  
&gt;With marksmen, we have a few advantages. First, because the class as a whole already has a clear function and they\u2019re played in pretty much every game of League, we have a much stronger understanding of their capabilities and expectations. Additionally, because the core weakness of every marksman is \u201cblow \u2018em up,\u201d they have some pretty clear checks in place when it comes to solo-carrying games.  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking forward, our vision remains consistent: We want to give each updated champion a unique reason to be brought to a game, and we want each champion to feel different whether playing against, as, or with. For some, this means sharpening what they already do well, or *should* do well. For others, it means finding new elements that make them feel special. We want you to have a reason to pick Graves over Lucian, and vice-versa, outside of just dealing more damage.   
&gt;  
&gt;Our additional goal is to ensure basic attacks between marksmen are as differentiated as possible. This is a new goal that\u2019s very important for this group in particular, given how reliant they are on basic attacks.  
&gt;   
&gt;Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the changes. We\u2019ll be throwing out a high-level overview of the updates before we go a little deeper on the philosophy behind them, in case you haven\u2019t checked out the site.  
&gt;   
&gt;**Graves**  
&gt;*\u201cThis calls for the ol\u2019 double-barreled \u2018Hello.\u2019\u201d*  
&gt;  
&gt;Graves\u2019 double-barreled shotgun is one of the most distinctive weapons in the marksman arsenal. However, this weapon was underutilized as a kind of mid-range, burst, poke, cone spell. So we doubled-down on the classic shotgun fantasy. Now Graves\u2019 basic attacks fire four rounds (eight on a crit!) in a cone in front of him, dealing damage and knocking back minions. Graves has tradeoffs for this unique mechanic, as he has to reload after firing two rounds (but can quickly reload via Quickdraw), and his basic attacks can be body-blocked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because we basically pushed Graves\u2019 Q onto his basic attack, we decided to give him a new Q in the form of End of the Line, where he fires out an explosive canister, leaving behind a trail of gunpowder. That canister then explodes after a few seconds (or immediately on colliding with a wall) and detonates the gunpowder for additional damage.   
&gt;  
&gt;With the defensive buff from Quickdraw and his incredibly high threat on close-range targets, Graves is the kind of marksman you want to bring when enemies have a lot of backline access (see: diving assassins). The tradeoff here is that Graves loses out on a lot of long-range target selection that other marksmen have, since his basic attacks can\u2019t go over enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes focuses on pushing Graves\u2019 identity as a close-range, brawling marksman, and we\u2019re excited to see how he does once he gets into the fight.  
&gt;   
&gt;**Quinn**  
&gt;*\u201cJustice takes wing.\u201d*  
&gt;   
&gt;Despite its innate coolness factor, Quinn's old ultimate still had problems. It forced her into overwhelming danger, often leading to trades at the cost of her life (not a great deal!). We are re-imagining her ultimate to play up its tag-team, high-speed nature: Valor now swoops down to carry Quinn, giving her massive out-of-combat mobility. This sharpens Quinn\u2019s identity as a rapid-response marksman. Quinn can aid skirmishes in the jungle, swap lanes to help ganks, respond to split-pushes (or split-push herself), and make it back in time to help with a team fight. Need eyes on Baron? Send Quinn to scout it out!  
&gt;   
&gt;**Corki**  
&gt;*\u201cBombs away!\u201d*  
&gt;   
&gt;Corki, the Daring Bombardier, hasn\u2019t been very True to his title. Optimal play for Corki was to play it safe and poke from a distance; he lacked the tools to make big plays. We decided to fix this in an\u2026 explosive way. With the addition of Special Delivery - a single-time upgrade to Valkyrie that amps up the damage, range, and disruption of the ability - Corki needs to focus on what sort of decisive action he\u2019ll take to capitalize on the skill. It won\u2019t be easy, but the reward is huge.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, to further push Corki\u2019s identity as the magic damage marksman, his auto-attacks now deal split magic/physical damage and his gatling gun shreds both resists. This allows teams to build around Corki being the primary magic damage dealer, something rather unique in the strategic space of marksmen.  
&gt;   
&gt;**Miss Fortune**  
&gt;*\u201cFortune doesn\u2019t favor fools.\u201d*  
&gt;   
&gt;Miss Fortune has been synonymous with the famed WOMBO COMBO since she first strutted onto the Rift, though much less so after frequent nerfs to Bullet Time. We wanted the WOMBO back, so we increased her ult\u2019s duration by 50% and increased the number of bullet waves as the game progresses by\u2026 a lot.   
&gt;  
&gt;As for her new passive, we drew a lot of inspiration from Double Up. In lane, Miss Fortune draws tons of strength from her Q, especially in a 2v2 scenario where she can put a lot of pressure on both targets if they don\u2019t position properly. These changes are our way of doubling\u2026 down on that thematic, with more rewards for precise target juggling and positioning (the precision is important as well, as there are champions like Varus or Twitch who excel at dumping out a lot of group AoE damage).   
&gt;   
&gt;**Caitlyn**  
&gt;*\u201cMeet the long gun of the law.\u201d*  
&gt;   
&gt;For Caitlyn, we had to ask ourselves, \u201cHow much further can we push the sharpshooter fantasy?\u201d The answer: Like, a lot further. By giving Caitlyn massive range on any enemy she can net or trap, we\u2019re emphasizing her sharpshooting strengths. Giving Yordle Snap Trap an ammo system amplifies Cait\u2019s natural ability to create choke points, while also improving  her ability to dominate territory around objectives. The choice  between spreading traps for surprise ambushes and setting up lines of defense gives you different ways to capitalize on Cait\u2019s role as League\u2019s #1 sniper elite.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Kog\u2019Maw**  
&gt;*\u201cFeeding time!\u201d*  
&gt;   
&gt;Everyone\u2019s favorite Void puppy just got even more adorabler. Kog\u2019Maw already has a familiar identity in his \u201cProtect the Kog\u201d team comp, but we felt we could amplify it while also separating him from other tank busters. Now, Kog\u2019s Bio-Arcane Barrage doubles his attack speed and attack speed cap, up to five attacks per second (!!!). This makes him the quintessential attack speed \u201cproc\u201d champion, a low-mobility machine-gun of death. It does wonders for creating a unique itemization path and, of course, it makes him look way cooler.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a quick note for Living Artillery: Changing the damage from raw poke to execution allows Kog to differentiate himself from other long-range pokers. Kog by himself might not make for the perfect poke composition, but if you combine him with enough additional pressure, he can pick off fleeing enemies while also becoming a central damage turret for his team.  
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;So those are our rough thoughts on the update. We\u2019d love to hear yours as you test the changes in action (soon), but these, in tandem with the marksmen itemization update, should bring some interesting changes to the class as a whole.

 **Syndra Passive Idea!**

&gt;With Syndra's balance issue normally revolving around her fairly weak passive, I've decided to create one on my own. I do main Syndra, also, so don't think I'm just some randomer trying to solve a Champion's problem that I know nothing about! I just find Syndra's passive to be her weak-point. I mean it begins to do something at level 9!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Transcendence**  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt; The more spells Syndra casts, the more _Power_ she obtains. She gains increased spell damage based on the amount of _Power_ she has. If Syndra reaches the maximum amount of _Power_, all of her spells will begin to cost health.   
&gt;Syndra rapidly begins losing _Power_ once she stops casting spells for 6/4/2 (Every 6 levels) seconds, or if she uses her ultimate, immediately setting her power to 0.  The maximum amount of _Power_ she may have is increased for every maxed ability Syndra has.  
&gt;  
&gt;Amount of Power: 100 +50 per maxed ability [300 at level 18]  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Q - Generates 20/20/20/20/40 power / costs 3/3.25/3.5/3.75/4% of current health at maximum power  
&gt;2. W - Generates 20/20/25/25/50 power / costs 3/3.25/3.5/3.75/4% of current health at maximum power  
&gt;3. E - Generates 20 power / costs 2% of current health at maximum power  
&gt;4. R - Drains all current power  
&gt;  
&gt;Bonus Spell Damage: 5% for every 50 power [30% at 300 power]  
&gt;  
&gt;Syndra's mana bar is inverted, a dark shade of purple instead of blue, and is called her Power Bar. It appears empty, but once you cast a spell it will raise by a certain amount. Syndra could of course stay in her safety zone, but knowing Syndra, she won't. One Syndra breaks her limit, she will become unstable, causing her powerful spells to backlash. Her Power bar will reach it's limited capacity (which increases as she becomes more powerful throughout the game). She can either stop casting spells, allowing herself to cool down and her Power bar to begin rapidly decreasing, or she may release all of her power in one big frontal barrage in the form of her ultimate, _Unleashed Power_.  
&gt;  
&gt;This would change Syndra's core items immensely,  
&gt;  
&gt;1. {{item:3020}} for the magic penetration.  
&gt;   
&gt;2. {{item:3152}} would fit her very well with this passive, giving her high sustain and CDR. Not to mention corresponds well with her abilities, especially at maxed Power.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. {{item:3151}} with it's additional health, this would make Will of the Ancients even more valued, along with increasing damage!  
&gt;  
&gt;4. {{item:3116}} same as above context.  
&gt;  
&gt;No longer would Syndra be hindered by mana. This creates a fine power curve for Syndra, without making her completely weak in the early game.   
&gt;  
&gt;Tell me what you think and how I could balance it anymore!  
&gt;  
&gt;Any questions about it?

[Riot Pwyff wrote on 2015-11-05 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/PYx2Jd1M-dev-blog-vision-in-the-2016-season):

 **[DEV BLOG] Vision in the 2016 Season**

&gt;Posting for **Xypherous!**  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019ve generally been happy with some of the new vision mechanics in the game with the advent of Season 5. However, as the vision system has grown organically over time, the map has become increasingly brighter and brighter since Season 4.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the amount of unused trinkets and profusion of various vision types made it hard to consider expansions onto an already bloated system so this Season will mostly focus around concentrating the vision game to fewer discrete points.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:2044}}   
&gt;  
&gt;First off, we\u2019ve removed Green Wards. This is a pretty big sledgehammer to vision overall and the map is significantly darker because of it. We heard a lot of feedback on this and I wanted to give more context:  
&gt;  
&gt;When vision is in a \u201cconsumable\u201d state, it does a few things to the game that we want to change. First, because map knowledge is so powerful, the ideal state of vision for two teams is basically \u201cas much as you can.\u201d That means that teams will be perpetually funneling their excess gold (or in the case of supports and some junglers, their core gold income) into as much vision upkeep as possible. The compelling decision of *when* to ward and *where* to ward gets flattened.   
&gt;  
&gt;For supports, engaging so heavily with the vision system means they\u2019ll often need to give up late-game purchases and slot efficiency to ensure the map is well lit. For others, it becomes a gold dump to push an advantage. By taking all \u2018safe\u2019 vision (invisible wards) out of the gold stream and placing them on meaningfully gated cooldowns, teams will have to think a lot more about where they want to set up on the map, rather than it being a given luxury for who can do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to the removal of Green Wards, we\u2019re also doing the following changes:  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:2043}}   
&gt;  
&gt;Pink Wards will still remain buyable and represent an investment into permanent vision control over an area. They\u2019re also slightly cheaper and fall into Sight Ward\u2019s original cost range.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Trinkets**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Trinket System has been streamlined down to 2 basic options, plus 2 \u201calterations\u201d that become available at Level 9. Trinkets also now continuously improve with level rather than at discrete levels in the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3361}}   
&gt;  
&gt;**Warding Totem** will now behave like the upgraded **Warding Totem** on live which slowly charges up to store additional wards. The duration and charges have been tweaked to increase continuously with character level.   
&gt;  
&gt;We like the flexibility and general gameplay of the upgraded trinket as it allows you to maintain vision over a small area for a long time or tactically cover a wide area by yourself if you\u2019ve built up charges over time - giving it a much wider range of potential uses.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3341}}   
&gt;  
&gt;**Sweeping Lens** has taken a hit in power now that there aren\u2019t potentially green wards everywhere.   
&gt;  
&gt;To compensate, red gains the ability to warn against things that you can\u2019t see in the area letting you know the shape or silhouette of things in fog of war without revealing them directly. This includes things like jungler monsters (check if that camp is up!) and Pink Wards, in addition to providing the silhouette of stealthed threats like champions in brush, fog of war or stealth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweeping Lens\u2019 core functionality becomes alerting you as to whether or not anything in the swept area can detect you and allowing you to disable them.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **\u201cAlterations\u201d**  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of upgrades, which are strictly better than the original trinket that you have, we\u2019ve instead chosen to move in the direction of side-grading and altering existing functionality of trinkets.   
&gt;  
&gt;These swap the functionality of your existing trinket by improving the power of some aspects and decreasing the power in other aspects.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3363}}   
&gt;  
&gt;Yellow Trinket\u2019s alteration - the **Farsight Totem** is unlocked at level 9 and functions similarly to the Farsight Orb on live with some improvements. You gain vastly increased range and a shorter cooldown\u2026 at the expense of having visible wards and losing the ability to build charges.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a departure from live, these \u201cblue\u201d wards now last forever and don\u2019t count towards your ward count. Since these wards are easily destructible by opponents, we don\u2019t foresee this as contributing significantly to the overall vision of the map unless a team decides to use multiple blue trinkets in parallel to light up disparate regions of the map over time.   
&gt;  
&gt;So you can light up the map as long as you do it as part of an ongoing campaign to hold territory for extended periods of time.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{item:3364}}   
&gt;  
&gt;The Sweeping Lens\u2019 alteration - the **Oracle Lens** (also unlocked at 9) - is more tame in comparison and very similar to the Oracle upgrade on live. In lieu of gaining True sight, the red trinket simply has a much wider sweep range and follows you around for 10 seconds.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, combined with the fact that red trinket can warn you against enemy units that you can\u2019t see - this means it will also provide a proximity check so you don\u2019t walk headlong into an enemy ward or brush.  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Closing**  
&gt;  
&gt;Vision remains an important key strategic strength in League of Legends. The current vision system has a ton of small moving parts, as well as a few mechanics that just make the system kind of obtuse to interact with.  
&gt;  
&gt;We want to streamline the existing vision items to a smaller core set of vision items while also allowing that core to branch out in interesting directions and overlapping functions. Overall, the power in vision should be more condensed in the options that remain.   
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re taking advantage of the overall reduction in small vision buys to offer more interesting total item build options in the form of the Sightstone upgrades or the Jungle enchantments. Our goal was not to make the overall vision experience more complicated, but allow vision options to form the basis for more interesting total builds. From the support who forgoes his actives in favor of a powerful AP build, to the support who doubles down on active items, to the Jungler who forgoes combat in favor of map wide vision and utility.

 **Upgrading the Intentional Feeder Detection System**

&gt;Hey all,  
&gt;   
&gt;_(Neurocat\u2019s out for a week, so I\u2019m dropping in to give an Instant Feedback update)_  
&gt;  
&gt;A few weeks back we launched intentional feeding detection, a long-desired addition to [Instant Feedback](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers) that handed out 14-day or permanent bans to intentional feeders. Initially, we tuned the detection to be _very conservative_ because we wanted to be absolutely sure Instant Feedback could distinguish bad games from genuine intentional feeding. Now that the system\u2019s crunched through a few million games of data, we feel confident turning intentional feeding detection up a notch.    
&gt;  
&gt;Like with all adjustments to Instant Feedback, the team will hand review the first few thousand cases to make sure everything\u2019s working the way it\u2019s meant to. This upgrade\u2019s already live in NA, and will roll out worldwide before the end of the year. In fact, the system\u2019s already made its first ban. His /allchat log reads:  
&gt;  
&gt;[All] (Hecarim): uh... i dont care  
&gt;[All] (Hecarim): and riot will not care  
&gt;[All] (Hecarim): who wants kill?  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh Hecarim. We care a lot. We\u2019ll update this post when the feature\u2019s gone global.

 **The State of Marksmen, part 3 (What, Why, and How the Preseason Changes the Game. ) (Megapost)**

&gt;_This chapter of the** The State of the Marksmen** is a bit different; rather than explaining the issues with marksmen like the first post, [**Why they need the Rework**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework), or, how said issues are and aren't being addressed in the second post, [**Why this Rework isn\u2019t it, Yet**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet), this chapter details the systematic changes on PBE, AND THEN explains the issues they address as well as their other implications._  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s tons of notable and exciting changes to champions and items on PBE, but those alone can\u2019t fix lack of strategic diversity. Most strategic niches have a fairly small pool of champions that fulfill them well (tower siege and marksmen, for example); changing items so that other champions can perform crowds out the original fulfiller if the items themselves are worthwhile to pick up, such as how strong damage itemization for tanks in cinderhulk and thornmail crowded out typical damage junglers for a good part of this season. Changing champions to fill roles untypical for their champion pool generally results in the champion not seeing play. To have the power budget for atypical strengths, they need atypical weaknesses, which tends to result in a nearly unplayed champion once they are nerfed to a reasonable power level. Quinn is a good example of this. She is well balanced on live, but her capabilities as a roaming assassin requires the typical marksmen functions of low risk and high dps for tank busting and tower siege  to suffer.. As teams currently need those functions of a marksman, she tends to be played as a very niche pick top. She\u2019s effective there, but opportunity cost of what she replaced, and the effectiveness of armor against a double ADC comp, severally limits her play.   
&gt;  
&gt;**This post is about what is being done in preseason for what CAN fix strategic diversity** - systematic changes. We tend to take for granted the layout of the map or the many mathematical functionalities of the game, but changes to these have wide consequences, and tend to be necessary to make room for item or champion changes to give viability, power, or enjoyability to certain playstyles without taking an equal amount away from their competition. The start of season three was full of these. Prior, part of the role of junglers and supports was to be effective while cash starved, which generally included building the gp10 items Philosopher\u2019s Stone (mana and hp regen) and Heart of Gold (HP). This more or less limited the jungle to CC tanks like Amumu and Rammus, and supports to utility. S3 changed this by increasing base passive gp10 from 13 to 16 while equivalently reducing the value of lane minions for farmers, making the jungle harder and more rewarding, and adding a slew of diverse jungle and support items. Only by lessening some of the requirements for jungler and supports did they have the power budget to open up the positions in a healthy manner.   
&gt;  
&gt;Season 6 abounds with systematic changes as well, and as they are crucial to understand the champion and item changes, I\u2019m addressing them in this chapter before going onto the champion and items changes in the next. Let us begin.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to turret defenses**_ - Turrets have nearly doubled HP on the PBE, going from 2000/2300/2300/2500 to 3500/3500/4000/4000 for tier 1/2/Inhibitor/Nexus turrets respectively, while they all went from 100 armor and MR to 0 of both. As 100 armor or MR is exactly 50% damage reduction, turrets are only slightly squishier. This a good change for clarity - towers now take exactly as much damage as one deals them, while the changes have fewer consequences than you\u2019d think. Unlike monsters, towers have an equal amount of armor and MR, so this doesn\u2019t change relative effectiveness of physical or magic damage against them, and they are also immune to all forms of penetration, so armor pen is no more or less effective against them. However, it does have few subtler interactions. The flat 30 damage reduction towers get against attacks before 7 minutes was applied after armor, so it is much less effective now, and thusly towers are much easier to take early.  The 200 armor and MR towers get while no enemy minions is noticeably more effective; while 300 armor takes half the damage 100 armor does, 200 armor takes a third the damage 0 armor does. This works out to turrets taking 8000/9200/9200/12000 pre-mitigation damage on live vs 10500/10500/12000/12000 on PBE, so nexus turrets are just as difficult to take without minions, while all other towers are harder on PBE. Of note, Janna\u2019s shield on towers now breaks twice as easily. There\u2019s yet another change - the ratio that AP damages towers has been increased to .5 from .4, so AP champions can take towers easily. As always, the bonus from AP only goes into effect if it\u2019s larger than your bonus AD, and replaces bonus AD you if it is. Hybrid champions punished just like always, but at least now it\u2019s more readable - the number you see  when you hit a turret should be the higher of either exactly 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. The sum of these changes is that turrets should go down faster compared to live, especially before 7 minutes and with AP heavy builds. This makes for faster games on average.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to gold income**_- Like nearly every preseason, passive gold income went up, this time from 19 to 20.4 per 10. Unlike most preseasons, Riot didn\u2019t decrease gold income elsewhere, and instead inflated price. Offensive items took the brunt of loss in gold efficiency, tank items for the most part got a near equivalent amount of extra stats in compensation, and support items didn\u2019t change in price much. Net change is that supports are richer, tank items are more effective while about as difficult to buy, and missing farm either from lack of skill or your opponents excess of it is slightly less punishing. Supports are further helped by an increase in item gold income of roughly 2 gp 10, more details on that in the next post.   
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to masteries_** - I plan on going in depth into each mastery next post, but there's several main trends to note. Each tree now goes to 18 points, with 5 points to advance in tier 1, 3, and 5, and a single point for the nodes in 2, 4,and especially 6. Every tier has 2 nodes but the final, which has 3, and you can\u2019t spend any more than the points needed to advance in each tier, or a single point in the final tier. It forces you to make real, impactful choices based around your gameplay and champion, rather than a generalized min-max shared with everyone who uses that champion. The offense and utility tree were combined then resplit into ferocity and cunning - more along the lines of life sustain (vamp) and DPS for ferocity, and mana sustain, utility, and burst in cunning. The the defensive tree is basically what you\u2019d expect, but the choices are real. The keystone (tier 6, you only get one) nodes are all awesome and highly game impacting. I\u2019ll discuss them in the next chapter, but the big takeaways are supports have a helluva lot more options, as the cunning tree is less necessary, let\u2019s supports go full down another tree as its mana regen and gold income only take 12 points, and also has good damage options (I expect most assassins, and many mages, to go 12 in ferocity and 18 in cunning). Finally, the masteries now heavily value specialisation, rather than giving you a large bunch of generically useful stats. This in turn benefits specialist picks, like Soraka and her healing, considerably stronger than generalists like Thresh. This also means squishies specializing in damage do noticeably more damage to squishies doing the same. There\u2019s certainly some clear winners with the new masteries, but I\u2019d need to save that till I go after them one-by-one in the next chapter.   
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Changes to Call to Help_** - This one is probably the most undervalued of all the changes. Currently, autoattacks draw aggro to the shooter from minions 1) within ~ 650 range of the attacked target, and 2) within 400 units of of being able to auto attack said shooter. This has meant that so as long as ranged champions ~650 units minus their auto attack range away from your minions, (Typical range is around 550, so 100 units, or 1 teemo) they could poke you from max range without drawing minion aggro, effectively zoning you completely out of any attempt to CS, and maybe even XP range. Caitlyn\u2019s range is 650, so she can more or less stand in minions and zone without retaliation. The first image shows a red circle for the call for help range. On PBE, there\u2019s a ~650 range zone on the attacker that will draw aggro as well, the purple circle in the second image; this means ranged champions can\u2019t as effectively zone melee champs (or ranged champions, although that\u2019s less of an issue) in the early game when minion damage is still relevant, while not particularly affecting aggro for melee champions, as their circle is going to be overlapping their opponents if they are autoing. There\u2019s some changes to minion deleashing that make minion agro a bit easier for both ranged and melee champions to get rid of that partially negates this (no more minions following you through jungle from one lane to another), especially if ranged champions can abuse it easier. In part two I while talking about the dominance of marksmen bot lane, I said \u201cAt the very least, we need some changes to make melee's either more reliable or more rewarding bot lane, with reliability the healthiest option.\u201d This is the kind of healthy change for their reliability I was talking about. I\u2019d like to see it pushed a little further, perhaps with melee mobs (who unlikely to significantly agro to a ranged champion except in hard zoning situations, even with the changes) doing increased damage against ranged champions. This is the healthiest mechanic I\u2019ve seen so far for adjusting the reliability of melee vs ranged. Minion agro has always been much more brutal for melee champions than ranged, and the power from this divide is both completely superfluous and unclear.

&gt;___  
&gt;**_The Rift Herald_** - There's a new Jungle mob that spawns at four minutes in the baron pit, and respawns 5 minutes after being killed. It disappears at 19:45 to make room for baron, or 19:55 if it was in combat. It\u2019s a tanky, high dps (much higher than dragon) mutated scuttle crab, with an eye on its back that opens on occasion. The eye can\u2019t be hit by the person tanking, but someone else can hit it for 15% of its max hp in True damage - more than smite. This allows two people to take it quite quickly, while it is nearly impossible to take one on one. When killed, it gives everyone on the killers team 50 gold, and the killer itself a mini-baron buff. The buff grants 10% increased damage, but not True damage, 40 movespeed, a 40% buff to nearby minion attack speeds, and the 4 second recall of baron buff. While not as important as dragon, this objective gives top lane a strategic objective beyond just turrets, which in turn makes ignite or exhaust taken for lane dominance stronger relative to TP, and gives junglers and mid laners more incentive to gank or pressure either lane - top lane to take the herald (and top tower with the minion buff), or bot lane to distract the other team while top and the other take it. Overall, it\u2019s a great strategic addition that will make top lane less of an island, while lowering the dominance of TP, as TP is no longer necessary for top laners to influence the rest of the game pre-20 minutes in, and brings reason for influence to come to them.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Lowered XP and higher gold from jungle mobs for non-junglers_** - the jungle items were shifted from giving bonus gold on monsters kills to bonus experience, while monsters XP was shifted down while their was gold shifted up to compensate. This is almost entirely due to the dominance of top lane either double jungling, were the they tank two camps for the jungler, leaching xp and killing the small monsters, so that they both get level two with the jungler at higher health, or the top lanner taking a camp for themselfs level one, then in either case recalling and teleporting top with extra potions and level 2. Once a again, this is a nerf to TP.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Teleport_** - Notice a trend? TP no longer gets a 60 second lower CD for teleporting to towers. In all honesty, I woulda kept this and instead just increased its CD by 30 seconds in both cases. The real issue for the most part is the jungling issues above, that TP is the best summoner mid asides from flash, TP being even better than flash top, and frequent teleports to lane wards bot lane to capitalize on overextension/aggression. This has really made bot lane much more passive than it used to. TP\u2019s high usage is largely symptomatic of top lane being so strategically non-optimal for junglers and mid to roam to (In high tier play, a jungler or mid being spotted top, at least without TP, means the that the other team takes drag) TP is the only way top laners can see any action before 25 minutes, of ignite being use-impaired top and especially mid lane thanks to barrier, the meta, it\u2019s low range, common shielding items, and current support picks (caugh caugh Tahm) countering the bursty playstyle that traditionally got ignite. This nerf however,  is largely negated by the 15% cdr reduction on summoner spells being early in the defensive tree, and therefore quite accessible to any top or mid that wants it. Boots of lucidity now grant another 10% cdr on summoner spells, and are cheaper, and the distortion upgrade is much more viable thanks to an replacement of the near mandatory (or at least, the most noticeable and fun) homeguard upgrade with a buff enabled on everyone at the 20 minute mark, although this isn\u2019t shipping with 5.22. Still, the CDR works with all summoners, so while it adds the lost power back to TP, it adds power to non-nerfed summoners as well.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Grievous wounds while making it extremely accessible for AD_** - They lowered the healing reduction to 40%, with non-implemented plans to make it not function against healing from allies, such as soraka healing her allies. They added executioner\u2019s calling back as a 800 gold item that grants 15 ad and applies grievous wounds for three seconds on ALL physical damage, and also combines with Last Whisper good gold and slot efficiency vs targets with armor. It comes at the cost of up to 1.5% increased damage per 50 health your opponent has over you, up to 15%, as that is the other Last Whisper upgrade. Otherwise, they cost exactly the same and give identical stats. Overall, I dislike this change the most. I\u2019d much prefer grievous wounds to be out of the game entirely, and all healing reduced a third or so towards late game to compensate. Right now, healing is over the top because it needs to be balanced around the fact that grievous wounds is so available. Having a certain item 100% necessary, especially a cheap one with no active, against many of the champions in the game doesn\u2019t add any counterplay, and makes balancing a nightmare revolving around whether or not people buy the item.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to shutdown gold, including globalizing it_** - Shutdown\u2019s now start at only 2 kills, but still cap at 5 kills. Dying lowers it by 3 kills, but not lower than 0, rather than resetting it. Oddly enough, after a shutdown at 4 kills, you\u2019ll still get shutdown at 1 stack. Most importantly, the bonus gold for shutdowns is now global - the kill grants 300 gold to the killer and 150 gold split among the assistants, but also grants 20/30/60/70/90 (note the 20 gold one requires you to die at 4 stacks) gold the every member of the team, for a total of 100/150/300/350/460 team gold, rather than 0/50/108/175/200 without assists, or 0/75/162/262.5/300 with assists. Dying spree gold reduction unchanged as far as I know. This means quite a few things. This is a pretty noticeable increase in gold overall, spread evenly amongst the team.  It\u2019s much more worthwhile to try to coordinate against high value targets, as the reward is noticeably greater, and killing them second time still gives bonus gold if they were fed enough. Failing to get any assists on a shutdown no longer punishes your team gold any more than a normal kill - the 150 assist gold is still wasted, but it\u2019s not amplified by the team gold. This incentivise solo aggression and assassination against high value targets, rather than decentivising it like on. This helps assassins, and generally makes the game more interesting and faster in pace. The increased gold itself for shutdowns makes comebacks easier - kills 2 through 5 effectively give 150 gold apiece to the team being slaughtered if they kill the spreer, keeping in mind kills 4 and 5 carry some of the gold over onto their next death. When someone is fed, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem, and this makes killing them reword everyone.   
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Removal of Assist Streaks_** - this is largely due to the changes in bounty above, which more than make up for the lost income. Assist streaks encouraged passive play, like Janna with a Mejai\u2019s who only comes close enough to fights to shield the backline. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re gone.  
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Changes in Experience from Champion kills_** - The experience gained from the death of enemy champions higher level than you is significantly increased, while the experience gained from champs lower level than you is noticeably decreased. This lowers snowballing and makes comebacks considerably more likely. This encourages more aggressive play while loosing, which will in turn make the game faster paced, and faster overall.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_A Middle Finger Flipped Towards non-AD Junglers_** - Most non-epic Monsters lost their armor,  while many gained MR. T2 jungle items (And T3) now grant 10% lifesteal but no spellvamp, and generally less mana. At least it gives 30 hp over 5 seconds for every monster you damage, but AD junglers have plenty of AoE to get this as well, and anyone can smite Gromp or buy a Cinder. Runeglaive gives 10 less AP but gives 50 mana, costs 425 more, while cinderhulk simply costs 375 more. Devourer got back the 10 damage on-hit it lost last nerf, and only cost 200 more, while warrior lost its pen, gained 20 AD, and 375 gold to its price tag. I\u2019ll be going into this more in depth on my upcoming post about items. T1 Jungle items split into one only good for AD junglers, and one equally decent for AD jungler and everyone else. Jungle monsters generally got weaker, but t1 jungle items are much worse, and the t2 now costs 700 gold, The increase in gold for t3 jungle items is partially offset by the increase in gold income, fully for devourer. I\u2019m a bit bothered by favoritism for AD and Devourer, but in all honesty the jungle isn\u2019t too rough for mages or tanks.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Green wards are gone, Pink wards cost 75 gold, no trinket to reveal invisible units, and no upgrade for yellow trinket._** - Green wards are no longer in the shop, although sightstone still exists. The warding trinket now improves linearly from 1 to 9, rather than suddenly at 9, but it never gets better than a 120 second ward on a 120 second cooldown. Blue trinket is gone, and instead yellow trinket can upgrade into the current upgraded blue trinket for free at level 9, while the red trinket can upgrade for free into it\u2019s current upgrade, but instead of revealing invisible champions it gives them a radar-like outline every few second or so while active. There is no vision ward trinket available; There\u2019s literally no way to reveal invisible units besides pink wards, which requires you to have an open item slot. Very strong buff to Twitch\u2019s and Rengar\u2019s mid to late game, and to a less extent Talon. Pink wards are cheaper, which makes them even more enticing. You should always try to have one out if you aren\u2019t full build. The much lower vision available in the game encourages roaming, trying to make picks, and aggression, which in turn makes assassins stronger. Like many other changes this season, this increases the pace of the game and makes it bloodier. I like most of this, but I wish I had more options to ward when full build, and some way to reveal invisible units. I really miss the two upgrades for yellow trinket on live.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Block, Blind, and Dodge now consistently work against nearly all auto attacks and their modifiers_** - this is closer to champion changes than anything systematic, simply because there are so few champions that benefit. Jax, Pantheon, and Teemo got significantly stronger, especially against certain champs.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clones now get copies of their parent\u2019s jungle buffs_** - Once again, while a systematic change in theory, this is a buff to 3 champions, Shaco, Wukong, and LB. Still, it's something people have been asking since each champ came out, and it should have been in the game a lot sooner.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clarity and Clairvoyance removed_** - Doesn\u2019t have any in game effect, as no one gets them. Still available outside of Summoner's Rift  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_All marksmen have 5 to 9 more AD at level one, and roughly an equal amount less at level 18_** - This is in part due to the removal of flat AD from the mastery tree. This is a reasonable change, but I don\u2019t see why this was restricted to marksmen - pretty much every AD champion got it. This makes marksmen much stronger early game, and lets most of them Jungle. It does really help marksmen in solo lanes, which I\u2019m sure was a large part of Riot\u2019s intent.   
&gt;  
&gt;Well, there you have it. To the best of my knowledge, this is every change to things other than items, champions, and masteries so far on PBE for season 6. Expect a much faster paced game, marksmen appearing in every lane, more comebacks and upsets, and fewer teleports per game. My next chapter in The State of Marksmen is going to be in-depth on the new masteries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please comment; I'll try to reply to any answers or feedback.

 **The State of Marksmen, part 3 (What, Why, and How the Preseason Changes the Game. ) (Megapost)**

&gt;_This chapter of the** The State of the Marksmen** is a bit different; rather than explaining the issues with marksmen like the first post, [**Why they need the Rework**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework), or how said issues are and aren't being addressed in the second post, [**Why this Rework isn\u2019t it, Yet**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet), this chapter details the systematic changes on PBE, AND THEN explains the issues they address as well as their other implications._  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s tons of notable and exciting changes to champions and items on PBE, but those alone can\u2019t fix lack of strategic diversity. Most strategic niches have a fairly small pool of champions that fulfill them well (tower siege and marksmen, for example), while changing items so that other champions can perform them crowds out the original fulfiller if the items themselves are worthwhile to pick up, like how strong damage itemization for tanks in Cinderhulk and Thornmail crowded out typical damage junglers for a good part of this season. Changing champions to fill roles untypical for their champion pool generally results in the champion not seeing play. To have the power budget for atypical strengths, they need atypical weaknesses; this tends to result in a nearly unplayed champion once they are nerfed to a reasonable power level. Quinn is a good example of this. She is well balanced on live, but her capabilities as a roaming assassin requires the typical marksmen functions of low risk and high dps for tank busting and tower siege  to suffer. As teams currently need those functions of a marksman, she tends to be played as a very niche pick top. She\u2019s effective there, but opportunity cost of what she replaced, and the effectiveness of armor against a double ADC comp, severally limits her play.   
&gt;  
&gt;**This post is about what is being done in preseason for what CAN fix strategic diversity** - systematic changes. We tend to take for granted the layout of the map or the many mathematical functionalities of the game, but changes to these have wide consequences, and tend to be necessary to make room for item or champion changes to give viability, power, or enjoyability to certain playstyles without taking an equal or greater amount away from their competition. The start of season three was full of these. Prior, part of the role of junglers and supports was to be effective while cash starved, which generally included building the gp10 items Philosopher\u2019s Stone (mana and hp regen) and Heart of Gold (HP). This more or less limited the jungle to CC tanks like Amumu and Rammus, and supports to utility. S3 changed this by increasing base passive gp10 from 13 to 16 while equivalently reducing the value of lane minions for farmers, making the jungle harder and more rewarding, and adding a slew of diverse jungle and support items. Only by lessening some of the requirements for jungler and supports did they have the power budget to open up the positions in a healthy manner.   
&gt;  
&gt;Season 6 abounds with systematic changes as well, and as they are crucial to understand the champion and item changes, I\u2019m addressing them in this chapter before going onto the champion and items changes in the next. Let us begin.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to turret defenses**_ -  (Mostly addressed in the last post) Turrets have nearly doubled HP on the PBE, going from 2000/2300/2300/2500 to 3500/3500/4000/4000 for tier 1/2/Inhibitor/Nexus turrets respectively, while they all went from 100 armor and MR to 0 of both. As 100 armor or MR is exactly 50% damage reduction, turrets are only slightly squishier. This a good change for clarity - towers now take exactly as much damage as one deals them, while the changes have fewer consequences than you\u2019d think. Unlike monsters, towers have an equal amount of armor and MR, so this doesn\u2019t change relative effectiveness of physical or magic damage against them, and they are also immune to all forms of penetration, so penetration is no more or less effective against them. However, it does have few subtler interactions. The flat 30 damage reduction towers get against attacks before 7 minutes was applied after armor, so it is much less effective now, and thusly towers are much easier to take early.  The 200 armor and MR towers get while no enemy minions are nearby is noticeably more effective; while 300 armor takes half the damage 100 armor does, 200 armor takes a third the damage 0 armor does. This works out to turrets taking 8000/9200/9200/12000 pre-mitigation damage on live vs 10500/10500/12000/12000 on PBE, so nexus turrets are just as difficult to take without minions, while all other towers are harder. Of note, Janna\u2019s shield on towers now breaks twice as easily. There\u2019s yet another change - the ratio that AP damages towers has been increased to .5 from .4, so AP champions are more effective against towers. As always, the bonus from AP only goes into effect if it\u2019s larger than your bonus AD, and replaces bonus AD you if it is. Hybrid champions punished just like always, but at least now it\u2019s more readable - the number you see  when you hit a turret should be the higher of either exactly 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. The sum of these changes is that turrets should go down faster compared to live, especially before 7 minutes and with AP heavy builds. This makes for faster games on average.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to gold income**_- Like nearly every preseason, passive gold income went up, this time from 19 to 20.4 per 10 (I remember 10 gp 10, geez). Unlike most preseasons, Riot didn\u2019t decrease gold income elsewhere, and instead inflated price. Offensive items took the brunt of loss in gold efficiency, tank items for the most part got a near equivalent amount of extra stats in compensation, and support items didn\u2019t change in price much. Net change is that supports are richer, tank items are more effective while about as difficult to buy, and missing farm either from lack of skill, or your opponents excess of it, is slightly less punishing. Supports are further helped by an increase in item gold income of roughly 2 gp 10, more details on that in the next post.   
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to masteries_** - I plan on going in depth into each mastery next post, but there's several main trends to note. Each tree now goes to 18 points, with 5 points to advance in tier 1, 3, and 5, and a single point for the nodes in 2, 4, and 6. Every tier has 2 nodes but the final, which has 3, and you can\u2019t spend any more than the points needed to advance in each tier, or a single point in the final tier. It forces you to make real, impactful choices based around your gameplay and champion, rather than a generalized min-max shared with everyone who uses that champion. The offense and utility tree were combined then resplit into ferocity and cunning - more along the lines of life sustain (vamp) and DPS for ferocity, and mana sustain, utility, and burst in cunning. The the defensive tree is basically what you\u2019d expect, but the choices are real. The keystone (tier 6, you only get one) nodes are all awesome and highly game impacting. I\u2019ll discuss them in the next chapter, but the big takeaways are supports have a helluva lot more options, as the cunning tree is less necessary, let\u2019s supports go full down another tree as its mana regen and gold income only take 12 points, and also has good damage options (I expect most assassins, and many mages, to go 12 in ferocity and 18 in cunning). Finally, the masteries now heavily value specialisation, rather than giving you a large bunch of generically useful stats. This in turn benefits specialist picks, like Soraka and her healing, over  generalists like Thresh. This also means squishies specializing in damage do noticeably more damage to squishies doing the same. There\u2019s certainly some clear winners with the new masteries, but I\u2019d need to save that till I go after them one-by-one in the next chapter.   
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Changes to Call to Help_** - This one is probably the most undervalued of all the changes. Currently, autoattacks draw aggro to the shooter from minions 1) within ~ 650 range of the attacked target, and 2) within 400 units of of being able to auto attack said shooter. This has meant that so as long as ranged champions ~650 units minus their auto attack range away from your minions, (Typical range is around 550, so 100 units, or 1 teemo) they could poke you from max range without drawing minion aggro, effectively zoning you completely out of any attempt to CS, and maybe even XP range. Caitlyn\u2019s range is 650, so she can more or less stand in minions and zone without retaliation. The first image shows a red circle for the call for help range. On PBE, there\u2019s a ~650 range zone on the attacker that will draw aggro as well, the purple circle in the second image; this means ranged champions can\u2019t as effectively zone melee champs (or ranged champions, although that\u2019s less of an issue) in the early game when minion damage is still relevant, all while not particularly affecting aggro for melee champions as their circle is going to be overlapping their opponents if they are autoing. There\u2019s some changes to minion deleashing that make minion agro a bit easier for both ranged and melee champions to get rid of that partially negates this (no more minions following you through jungle from one lane to another), especially if ranged champions can abuse it easier. In part two I while talking about the dominance of marksmen bot lane, I said \u201cAt the very least, we need some changes to make melee's either more reliable or more rewarding bot lane, with reliability the healthiest option.\u201d This is the kind of healthy change for their reliability I was talking about. I\u2019d like to see it pushed a little further, perhaps with melee mobs (who are unlikely to significantly agro to a ranged champion except in hard zoning situations, even with the changes) doing increased damage against ranged champions. This is the healthiest mechanic I\u2019ve seen so far for adjusting the reliability of melee vs ranged. Minion agro has always been much more brutal for melee champions than ranged, and the power from this divide is both completely superfluous and unclear.

&gt;___  
&gt;**_The Rift Herald_** - There's a new Jungle mob that spawns at four minutes in the baron pit, and respawns 5 minutes after being killed. It disappears at 19:45 to make room for baron, or 19:55 if it was in combat. It\u2019s a tanky, high dps (much higher than dragon) mutated scuttle crab, with an eye on its back that opens on occasion. The eye can\u2019t be hit by the person tanking, but someone else can hit it for 15% of its max hp in True damage - more than smite. This allows two people to take it quite quickly, while it is nearly impossible to take one on one. When killed, it gives everyone on the killers team 50 gold, and the killer itself a mini-baron buff. The buff grants 10% increased damage, but not True damage, 40 movespeed, a 40% buff to nearby minion attack speeds, and the 4 second recall of baron buff. While not as important as dragon, this objective gives top lane a strategic objective beyond just turrets, which in turn makes ignite or exhaust taken for lane dominance stronger relative to TP, and gives junglers and mid laners more incentive to gank or pressure either lane - top lane to take the herald (and top tower with the minion buff), or bot lane to distract the other team while top and the other take it. Overall, it\u2019s a great strategic addition that will make top lane less of an island while lowering the dominance of TP, as TP is no longer necessary for top laners to influence the rest of the game pre-20 minutes in, as well as bringing reason for influence to come to them.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Lowered XP and higher gold from jungle mobs for non-junglers_** - The jungle items were shifted from giving bonus gold on monsters kills to bonus experience, while monsters XP was shifted down and their gold shifted up to compensate. This is almost entirely due to the dominance of top lane either double jungling, were they tank two camps for the jungler, leaching xp and killing the small monsters, so that they both get level two with the jungler at full health, or the top lanner taking a camp for themselfs level one, then in either case recalling and teleporting top with extra potions and level 2. Once a again, this is a nerf to TP.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Teleport_** - Notice a trend? TP no longer gets a 60 second lower CD for teleporting to towers. In all honesty, I would've kept that and instead just increased its CD by 30 seconds in both cases. The real issues are the jungling issues above, that TP is the best summoner mid asides from flash, TP being even better than flash top, and frequent teleports to lane wards bot lane to capitalize on overextension/aggression. This has really made bot lane much more passive than it used to. TP\u2019s high usage is largely symptomatic of top lane being so strategically non-optimal for junglers and mid to roam to (In high tier play, a jungler or mid being spotted top, at least without TP, means the that the other team takes drag) TP is the only way top laners can see any action before 25 minutes, of ignite being use-impaired top and mid lane thanks to barrier, the meta, it\u2019s low range, common shielding items, and current support picks (caugh caugh Tahm) countering the bursty playstyle that traditionally got ignite. This nerf however,  is largely negated by the 15% cdr reduction on summoner spells early on in the defensive tree, and therefore quite accessible to any top or mid that wants it. Boots of lucidity now grant another 10% cdr on summoner spells, and are cheaper, while the distortion upgrade is much more viable thanks to a replacement of the near mandatory (or at least, the most noticeable and fun) homeguard upgrade with a buff enabled on everyone at the 20 minute mark, although this isn\u2019t shipping with 5.22. Still, the CDR works with all summoners, so while it adds the lost power back to TP, it adds power to non-nerfed summoners as well.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Grievous wounds while making it extremely accessible for AD_** - They lowered the healing reduction to 40%, with non-implemented plans to make it not function against healing from allies, such as soraka healing her allies. They added executioner\u2019s calling back as a 800 gold item that grants 15 ad and applies grievous wounds for three seconds on ALL physical damage, and also combines with Last Whisper good gold and slot efficiency vs targets with armor. It comes at the cost of up to 1.5% increased damage per 50 health your opponent has over you, up to 15%, as that is the other Last Whisper upgrade. Otherwise, they cost exactly the same and give identical stats. Overall, I dislike this change the most. I\u2019d much prefer grievous wounds to be out of the game entirely, and all healing reduced a third or so towards late game to compensate. Right now, healing is over the top because it needs to be balanced around the fact that grievous wounds is so available. Having a certain item 100% necessary, especially a cheap one with no active, against many of the champions in the game doesn\u2019t add any counterplay, while it makes balancing a nightmare revolving around whether or not people buy the item.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to shutdown gold, including globalizing it_** - Shutdown\u2019s now start at only 2 kills, but still cap at 5 kills. Dying lowers it by 3 kills, but not lower than 0, rather than resetting it. Oddly enough, after a shutdown at 4 kills, you\u2019ll still get shutdown at 1 stack. Most importantly, the bonus gold for shutdowns is now global - the kill grants 300 gold to the killer and 150 gold split among the assistants, but also grants 20/30/60/70/90 (note the 20 gold one requires you to die at 4 stacks) gold the every member of the team, for a total of 100/150/300/350/460 team gold, rather than 0/50/108/175/200 without assists, or 0/75/162/262.5/300 with assists. Dying spree gold reduction unchanged as far as I know. This means quite a few things. This is a pretty noticeable increase in gold overall, spread evenly amongst the team.  It\u2019s much more worthwhile to try to coordinate against high value targets, as the reward is noticeably greater, and killing them a second time still gives bonus gold if they were fed enough. Failing to get any assists on a shutdown no longer punishes your team gold any more than a normal kill - the 150 assist gold is still wasted, but it\u2019s not amplified by the team gold. This incentivise solo aggression and assassination against high value targets, rather than decentivising it like on live. This helps assassins, and generally makes the game more interesting and faster in pace. The increased gold itself for shutdowns makes comebacks easier - kills 2 through 5 effectively give 150 gold apiece to the team being slaughtered if they kill the spreer, keeping in mind kills 4 and 5 carry some of the gold over onto their next death. When someone is fed, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem, and this makes killing them reward everyone.   
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Removal of Assist Streaks_** - this is largely due to the changes in bounty above, which more than make up for the lost income. Assist streaks encouraged passive play, like a Janna with a Mejai\u2019s who only comes close enough to fights to shield the backline. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re gone.  
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Changes in Experience from Champion kills_** - The experience gained from the death of enemy champions higher level than you is significantly increased, while the experience gained from champs lower level than you is noticeably decreased. This lowers snowballing and makes comebacks considerably more likely. This encourages more aggressive play while loosing, which will in turn make the game faster paced, and faster overall.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_A Middle Finger Flipped Towards non-AD Junglers_** - Most non-epic Monsters lost their armor,  while many gained MR. T2 jungle items (And T3) now grant 10% lifesteal but no spellvamp, and generally less mana. At least it gives 30 hp over 5 seconds for every monster you damage, but AD junglers have plenty of AoE to get this as well, and anyone can smite Gromp or buy a Cinder. Runeglaive gives 10 less AP but gives 50 mana, costs 425 more, while cinderhulk simply costs 375 more. Devourer got back the 10 damage on-hit it lost last nerf, and only cost 200 more, while warrior lost its pen, gained 20 AD, and 375 gold to its price tag. I\u2019ll be going into this more in depth on my upcoming post about items. T1 Jungle items split into one only good for AD junglers, and one equally decent for AD jungler and everyone else. Jungle monsters generally got weaker, but T1 jungle items are much worse, and the T2 now costs 700 gold, The increase in gold for t3 jungle items is partially offset by the increase in gold income, fully for devourer. I\u2019m a bit bothered by favoritism for AD and Devourer, but in all honesty the jungle isn\u2019t too rough for mages or tanks.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Green wards are gone, Pink wards cost 75 gold, no trinket to reveal invisible units, and no upgrade for yellow trinket._** - Green wards are no longer in the shop, although sightstone still exists. The warding trinket now improves linearly from levels 1 to 9, rather than suddenly at 9, but it never gets better than a 120 second ward on a 120 second cooldown. Blue trinket is gone, and instead yellow trinket can upgrade into the current upgraded blue trinket for free at level 9, while the red trinket can upgrade for free into it\u2019s current upgrade, but instead of revealing invisible champions it gives them a radar-like outline every few second or so while active. There is no vision ward trinket available; There\u2019s literally no way to reveal invisible units besides pink wards, which requires you to have an open item slot. Very strong buff to Twitch\u2019s and Rengar\u2019s mid to late game, and to a less extent Talon. Pink wards are cheaper, which makes them even more enticing. You should always try to have one out if you aren\u2019t full build. The much lower vision available in the game encourages roaming, trying to make picks, and aggression, which in turn makes assassins stronger. Like many other changes this season, this increases the pace of the game and makes it bloodier. I like most of this, but I wish I had more options to ward when full build, and some way to reveal invisible units. I really miss the two upgrades for yellow trinket on live.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Block, Blind, and Dodge now consistently work against nearly all auto attacks and their modifiers_** - This is closer to champion changes than anything systematic, simply because there are so few champions that benefit. Jax, Pantheon, and Teemo got significantly stronger, especially against certain champs.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clones now get copies of their parent\u2019s jungle buffs_** - Once again, while a systematic change in theory, this is a buff to 3 champions, Shaco, Wukong, and LB. Still, it's something people have been asking since each champ came out, and it should have been in the game a lot sooner.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clarity and Clairvoyance removed_** - Doesn\u2019t have any in game effect, as no one gets them. Still available outside of Summoner's Rift  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_All marksmen have 5 to 9 more AD at level one, and roughly an equal amount less at level 18_** - This is in part due to the removal of flat AD from the mastery tree. This is a reasonable change, but I don\u2019t see why this was restricted to marksmen - pretty much every AD champion got it. This makes marksmen much stronger early game, and lets most of them Jungle. It does really help marksmen in solo lanes, which I\u2019m sure was a large part of Riot\u2019s intent.   
&gt;  
&gt;Well, there you have it. To the best of my knowledge, this is every change to things other than items, champions, and masteries so far on PBE for season 6. Expect a much faster paced game, marksmen appearing in every lane, more comebacks and upsets, and fewer teleports per game. My next chapter in _The State of Marksmen_ is going to be in-depth on the new masteries.

 **The State of Marksmen, part 3 (What, Why, and How the Preseason Changes the Game. ) (Megapost)**

&gt;_This chapter of the** The State of the Marksmen** is a bit different; rather than explaining the issues with marksmen like the first post, [**Why they need the Rework**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IuOi5Ijj-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-meta-explained-part-1-why-they-need-the-rework), or how said issues are and aren't being addressed in the second post, [**Why this Rework isn\u2019t it, Yet**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7oL33kEa-the-state-of-marksmen-and-the-rework-explained-part-2-why-this-rework-isnt-it-yet), this chapter details the systematic changes on PBE, AND THEN explains the issues they address as well as their other implications._  
&gt;  
&gt;There\u2019s tons of notable and exciting changes to champions and items on PBE, but those alone can\u2019t fix lack of strategic diversity. Most strategic niches have a fairly small pool of champions that fulfill them well (tower siege and marksmen, for example), while changing items so that other champions can perform them crowds out the original fulfiller if the items themselves are worthwhile to pick up, like how strong damage itemization for tanks in Cinderhulk and Thornmail crowded out typical damage junglers for a good part of this season. Changing champions to fill roles untypical for their champion pool generally results in the champion not seeing play. To have the power budget for atypical strengths, they need atypical weaknesses; this tends to result in a nearly unplayed champion once they are nerfed to a reasonable power level. Quinn is a good example of this. She is well balanced on live, but her capabilities as a roaming assassin requires the typical marksmen functions of low risk and high dps for tank busting and tower siege  to suffer. As teams currently need those functions of a marksman, she tends to be played as a very niche pick top. She\u2019s effective there, but opportunity cost of what she replaced, and the effectiveness of armor against a double ADC comp, severally limits her play.   
&gt;  
&gt;**This post is about what is being done in preseason for what CAN fix strategic diversity** - systematic changes. We tend to take for granted the layout of the map or the many mathematical functionalities of the game, but changes to these have wide consequences, and tend to be necessary to make room for item or champion changes to give viability, power, or enjoyability to certain playstyles without taking an equal or greater amount away from their competition. The start of season three was full of these. Prior, part of the role of junglers and supports was to be effective while cash starved, which generally included building the gp10 items Philosopher\u2019s Stone (mana and hp regen) and Heart of Gold (HP). This more or less limited the jungle to CC tanks like Amumu and Rammus, and supports to utility. S3 changed this by increasing base passive gp10 from 13 to 16 while equivalently reducing the value of lane minions for farmers, making the jungle harder and more rewarding, and adding a slew of diverse jungle and support items. Only by lessening some of the requirements for jungler and supports did they have the power budget to open up the positions in a healthy manner.   
&gt;  
&gt;Season 6 abounds with systematic changes as well, and as they are crucial to understand the champion and item changes, I\u2019m addressing them in this chapter before going onto the champion and items changes in the next. Let us begin.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to turret defenses**_ -  (Mostly addressed in the last post) Turrets have nearly doubled HP on the PBE, going from 2000/2300/2300/2500 to 3500/3500/4000/4000 for tier 1/2/Inhibitor/Nexus turrets respectively, while they all went from 100 armor and MR to 0 of both. As 100 armor or MR is exactly 50% damage reduction, turrets are only slightly squishier. This a good change for clarity - towers now take exactly as much damage as one deals them, while the changes have fewer consequences than you\u2019d think. Unlike monsters, towers have an equal amount of armor and MR, so this doesn\u2019t change relative effectiveness of physical or magic damage against them, and they are also immune to all forms of penetration, so penetration is no more or less effective against them. However, it does have few subtler interactions. The flat 30 damage reduction towers get against attacks before 7 minutes was applied after armor, so it is much less effective now, and thusly towers are much easier to take early.  The 200 armor and MR towers get while no enemy minions are nearby is noticeably more effective; while 300 armor takes half the damage 100 armor does, 200 armor takes a third the damage 0 armor does. This works out to turrets taking 8000/9200/9200/12000 pre-mitigation damage on live vs 10500/10500/12000/12000 on PBE, so nexus turrets are just as difficult to take without minions, while all other towers are harder. Of note, Janna\u2019s shield on towers now breaks twice as easily. There\u2019s yet another change - the ratio that AP damages towers has been increased to .5 from .4, so AP champions are more effective against towers. As always, the bonus from AP only goes into effect if it\u2019s larger than your bonus AD, and replaces bonus AD you if it is. Hybrid champions punished just like always, but at least now it\u2019s more readable - the number you see  when you hit a turret should be the higher of either exactly 100% of your AD, or 100% of your base AD + 50% of your AP. The sum of these changes is that turrets should go down faster compared to live, especially before 7 minutes and with AP heavy builds. This makes for faster games on average.  
&gt;___  
&gt;_**Changes to gold income**_- Like nearly every preseason, passive gold income went up, this time from 19 to 20.4 per 10 (I remember 10 gp 10, geez). Unlike most preseasons, Riot didn\u2019t decrease gold income elsewhere, and instead inflated price. Offensive items took the brunt of loss in gold efficiency, tank items for the most part got a near equivalent amount of extra stats in compensation, and support items didn\u2019t change in price much. Net change is that supports are richer, tank items are more effective while about as difficult to buy, and missing farm either from lack of skill, or your opponents excess of it, is slightly less punishing. Supports are further helped by an increase in item gold income of roughly 2 gp 10, more details on that in the next post.   
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to masteries_** - I plan on going in depth into each mastery next post, but there's several main trends to note. Each tree now goes to 18 points, with 5 points to advance in tier 1, 3, and 5, and a single point for the nodes in 2, 4, and 6. Every tier has 2 nodes but the final, which has 3, and you can\u2019t spend any more than the points needed to advance in each tier, or a single point in the final tier. It forces you to make real, impactful choices based around your gameplay and champion, rather than a generalized min-max shared with everyone who uses that champion. The offense and utility tree were combined then resplit into ferocity and cunning - more along the lines of life sustain (vamp) and DPS for ferocity, and mana sustain, utility, and burst in cunning. The the defensive tree is basically what you\u2019d expect, but the choices are real. The keystone (tier 6, you only get one) nodes are all awesome and highly game impacting. I\u2019ll discuss them in the next chapter, but the big takeaways are supports have a helluva lot more options, as the cunning tree is less necessary, let\u2019s supports go full down another tree as its mana regen and gold income only take 12 points, and also has good damage options (I expect most assassins, and many mages, to go 12 in ferocity and 18 in cunning). Finally, the masteries now heavily value specialisation, rather than giving you a large bunch of generically useful stats. This in turn benefits specialist picks, like Soraka and her healing, over  generalists like Thresh. This also means squishies specializing in damage do noticeably more damage to squishies doing the same. There\u2019s certainly some clear winners with the new masteries, but I\u2019d need to save that till I go after them one-by-one in the next chapter.   
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Changes to Call to Help_** - This one is probably the most undervalued of all the changes. Currently, autoattacks draw aggro to the shooter from minions 1) within ~ 650 range of the attacked target, and 2) within 400 units of of being able to auto attack said shooter. This has meant that so as long as ranged champions ~650 units minus their auto attack range away from your minions, (Typical range is around 550, so 100 units, or 1 teemo) they could poke you from max range without drawing minion aggro, effectively zoning you completely out of any attempt to CS, and maybe even XP range. Caitlyn\u2019s range is 650, so she can more or less stand in minions and zone without retaliation. The first image shows a red circle for the call for help range. On PBE, there\u2019s a ~650 range zone on the attacker that will draw aggro as well, the purple circle in the second image; this means ranged champions can\u2019t as effectively zone melee champs (or ranged champions, although that\u2019s less of an issue) in the early game when minion damage is still relevant, all while not particularly affecting aggro for melee champions as their circle is going to be overlapping their opponents if they are autoing. There\u2019s some changes to minion deleashing that make minion agro a bit easier for both ranged and melee champions to get rid of that partially negates this (no more minions following you through jungle from one lane to another), especially if ranged champions can abuse it easier. In part two I while talking about the dominance of marksmen bot lane, I said \u201cAt the very least, we need some changes to make melee's either more reliable or more rewarding bot lane, with reliability the healthiest option.\u201d This is the kind of healthy change for their reliability I was talking about. I\u2019d like to see it pushed a little further, perhaps with melee mobs (who are unlikely to significantly agro to a ranged champion except in hard zoning situations, even with the changes) doing increased damage against ranged champions. This is the healthiest mechanic I\u2019ve seen so far for adjusting the reliability of melee vs ranged. Minion agro has always been much more brutal for melee champions than ranged, and the power from this divide is both completely superfluous and unclear.

&gt;_(Read Riot Reinboom's comment about this [here. ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2sEFscfP-so-does-riot-not-want-melee-champions-to-be-able-to-lane-vs-ranged-champions-anymore?comment=001400000000)It's where I stole the images from.)_  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_The Rift Herald_** - There's a new Jungle mob that spawns at four minutes in the baron pit, and respawns 5 minutes after being killed. It disappears at 19:45 to make room for baron, or 19:55 if it was in combat. It\u2019s a tanky, high dps (much higher than dragon) mutated scuttle crab, with an eye on its back that opens on occasion. The eye can\u2019t be hit by the person tanking, but someone else can hit it for 15% of its max hp in True damage - more than smite. This allows two people to take it quite quickly, while it is nearly impossible to take one on one. When killed, it gives everyone on the killers team 50 gold, and the killer itself a mini-baron buff. The buff grants 10% increased damage, but not True damage, 40 movespeed, a 40% buff to nearby minion attack speeds, and the 4 second recall of baron buff. While not as important as dragon, this objective gives top lane a strategic objective beyond just turrets, which in turn makes ignite or exhaust taken for lane dominance stronger relative to TP, and gives junglers and mid laners more incentive to gank or pressure either lane - top lane to take the herald (and top tower with the minion buff), or bot lane to distract the other team while top and the other take it. Overall, it\u2019s a great strategic addition that will make top lane less of an island while lowering the dominance of TP, as TP is no longer necessary for top laners to influence the rest of the game pre-20 minutes in, as well as bringing reason for influence to come to them.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Lowered XP and higher gold from jungle mobs for non-junglers_** - The jungle items were shifted from giving bonus gold on monsters kills to bonus experience, while monsters XP was shifted down and their gold shifted up to compensate. This is almost entirely due to the dominance of top lane either double jungling, were they tank two camps for the jungler, leaching xp and killing the small monsters, so that they both get level two with the jungler at full health, or the top lanner taking a camp for themselfs level one, then in either case recalling and teleporting top with extra potions and level 2. Once a again, this is a nerf to TP.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Teleport_** - Notice a trend? TP no longer gets a 60 second lower CD for teleporting to towers. In all honesty, I would've kept that and instead just increased its CD by 30 seconds in both cases. The real issues are the jungling issues above, that TP is the best summoner mid asides from flash, TP being even better than flash top, and frequent teleports to lane wards bot lane to capitalize on overextension/aggression. This has really made bot lane much more passive than it used to. TP\u2019s high usage is largely symptomatic of top lane being so strategically non-optimal for junglers and mid to roam to (In high tier play, a jungler or mid being spotted top, at least without TP, means the that the other team takes drag) TP is the only way top laners can see any action before 25 minutes, of ignite being use-impaired top and mid lane thanks to barrier, the meta, it\u2019s low range, common shielding items, and current support picks (caugh caugh Tahm) countering the bursty playstyle that traditionally got ignite. This nerf however,  is largely negated by the 15% cdr reduction on summoner spells early on in the defensive tree, and therefore quite accessible to any top or mid that wants it. Boots of lucidity now grant another 10% cdr on summoner spells, and are cheaper, while the distortion upgrade is much more viable thanks to a replacement of the near mandatory (or at least, the most noticeable and fun) homeguard upgrade with a buff enabled on everyone at the 20 minute mark, although this isn\u2019t shipping with 5.22. Still, the CDR works with all summoners, so while it adds the lost power back to TP, it adds power to non-nerfed summoners as well.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Nerf to Grievous wounds while making it extremely accessible for AD_** - They lowered the healing reduction to 40%, with non-implemented plans to make it not function against healing from allies, such as soraka healing her allies. They added executioner\u2019s calling back as a 800 gold item that grants 15 ad and applies grievous wounds for three seconds on ALL physical damage, and also combines with Last Whisper good gold and slot efficiency vs targets with armor. It comes at the cost of up to 1.5% increased damage per 50 health your opponent has over you, up to 15%, as that is the other Last Whisper upgrade. Otherwise, they cost exactly the same and give identical stats. Overall, I dislike this change the most. I\u2019d much prefer grievous wounds to be out of the game entirely, and all healing reduced a third or so towards late game to compensate. Right now, healing is over the top because it needs to be balanced around the fact that grievous wounds is so available. Having a certain item 100% necessary, especially a cheap one with no active, against many of the champions in the game doesn\u2019t add any counterplay, while it makes balancing a nightmare revolving around whether or not people buy the item.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes to shutdown gold, including globalizing it_** - Shutdown\u2019s now start at only 2 kills, but still cap at 5 kills. Dying lowers it by 3 kills, but not lower than 0, rather than resetting it. Oddly enough, after a shutdown at 4 kills, you\u2019ll still get shutdown at 1 stack. Most importantly, the bonus gold for shutdowns is now global - the kill grants 300 gold to the killer and 150 gold split among the assistants, but also grants 20/30/60/70/90 (note the 20 gold one requires you to die at 4 stacks) gold the every member of the team, for a total of 100/150/300/350/460 team gold, rather than 0/50/108/175/200 without assists, or 0/75/162/262.5/300 with assists. Dying spree gold reduction unchanged as far as I know. This means quite a few things. This is a pretty noticeable increase in gold overall, spread evenly amongst the team.  It\u2019s much more worthwhile to try to coordinate against high value targets, as the reward is noticeably greater, and killing them a second time still gives bonus gold if they were fed enough. Failing to get any assists on a shutdown no longer punishes your team gold any more than a normal kill - the 150 assist gold is still wasted, but it\u2019s not amplified by the team gold. This incentivise solo aggression and assassination against high value targets, rather than decentivising it like on live. This helps assassins, and generally makes the game more interesting and faster in pace. The increased gold itself for shutdowns makes comebacks easier - kills 2 through 5 effectively give 150 gold apiece to the team being slaughtered if they kill the spreer, keeping in mind kills 4 and 5 carry some of the gold over onto their next death. When someone is fed, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem, and this makes killing them reward everyone.   
&gt;___  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**_Removal of Assist Streaks_** - this is largely due to the changes in bounty above, which more than make up for the lost income. Assist streaks encouraged passive play, like a Janna with a Mejai\u2019s who only comes close enough to fights to shield the backline. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re gone.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Changes in Experience from Champion kills_** - The experience gained from the death of enemy champions higher level than you is significantly increased, while the experience gained from champs lower level than you is noticeably decreased. This lowers snowballing and makes comebacks considerably more likely. This encourages more aggressive play while loosing, which will in turn make the game faster paced, and faster overall.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_A Middle Finger Flipped Towards non-AD Junglers_** - Most non-epic Monsters lost their armor,  while many gained MR. T2 jungle items (And T3) now grant 10% lifesteal but no spellvamp, and generally less mana. At least it gives 30 hp over 5 seconds for every monster you damage, but AD junglers have plenty of AoE to get this as well, and anyone can smite Gromp or buy a Cinder. Runeglaive gives 10 less AP but gives 50 mana, costs 425 more, while cinderhulk simply costs 375 more. Devourer got back the 10 damage on-hit it lost last nerf, and only cost 200 more, while warrior lost its pen, gained 20 AD, and 375 gold to its price tag. I\u2019ll be going into this more in depth on my upcoming post about items. T1 Jungle items split into one only good for AD junglers, and one equally decent for AD jungler and everyone else. Jungle monsters generally got weaker, but T1 jungle items are much worse, and the T2 now costs 700 gold, The increase in gold for t3 jungle items is partially offset by the increase in gold income, fully for devourer. I\u2019m a bit bothered by favoritism for AD and Devourer, but in all honesty the jungle isn\u2019t too rough for mages or tanks.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Green wards are gone, Pink wards cost 75 gold, no trinket to reveal invisible units, and no upgrade for yellow trinket._** - Green wards are no longer in the shop, although sightstone still exists. The warding trinket now improves linearly from levels 1 to 9, rather than suddenly at 9, but it never gets better than a 120 second ward on a 120 second cooldown. Blue trinket is gone, and instead yellow trinket can upgrade into the current upgraded blue trinket for free at level 9, while the red trinket can upgrade for free into it\u2019s current upgrade, but instead of revealing invisible champions it gives them a radar-like outline every few second or so while active. There is no vision ward trinket available; There\u2019s literally no way to reveal invisible units besides pink wards, which requires you to have an open item slot. Very strong buff to Twitch\u2019s and Rengar\u2019s mid to late game, and to a less extent Talon. Pink wards are cheaper, which makes them even more enticing. You should always try to have one out if you aren\u2019t full build. The much lower vision available in the game encourages roaming, trying to make picks, and aggression, which in turn makes assassins stronger. Like many other changes this season, this increases the pace of the game and makes it bloodier. I like most of this, but I wish I had more options to ward when full build, and some way to reveal invisible units. I really miss the two upgrades for yellow trinket on live.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Block, Blind, and Dodge now consistently work against nearly all auto attacks and their modifiers_** - This is closer to champion changes than anything systematic, simply because there are so few champions that benefit. Jax, Pantheon, and Teemo got significantly stronger, especially against certain champs.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clones now get copies of their parent\u2019s jungle buffs_** - Once again, while a systematic change in theory, this is a buff to 3 champions, Shaco, Wukong, and LB. Still, it's something people have been asking since each champ came out, and it should have been in the game a lot sooner.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Clarity and Clairvoyance removed_** - Doesn\u2019t have any in game effect, as no one gets them. Still available outside of Summoner's Rift  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_All marksmen have 5 to 9 more AD at level one, and roughly an equal amount less at level 18_** - This is in part due to the removal of flat AD from the mastery tree. This is a reasonable change, but I don\u2019t see why this was restricted to marksmen - pretty much every AD champion got it. This makes marksmen much stronger early game, and lets most of them Jungle. It does really help marksmen in solo lanes, which I\u2019m sure was a large part of Riot\u2019s intent.   
&gt;  
&gt;Well, there you have it. To the best of my knowledge, this is every change to things other than items, champions, and masteries so far on PBE for season 6. Expect a much faster paced game, marksmen appearing in every lane, more comebacks and upsets, and fewer teleports per game. My next chapter in _The State of Marksmen_ is going to be in-depth on the new masteries.

 **[DEV BLOG] Keystone Masteries in the 2016 Season**

&gt;*Posting for **gypsylord** while he's out of the office today*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Keystone Masteries**  
&gt;By **gypsylord**  
&gt;  
&gt;When Squad5, Stashu, and I set out to work on the new mastery system we had one goal in mind: how do we get a 3-hit passive on every champion in the game? After months of ideation, we came up with Thunderlord\u2019s Decree, made it super strong, and BOOM, now even Warwick can have perfect gameplay.  
&gt;  
&gt;In all seriousness though, I\u2019m excited to be talking about the new masteries because we\u2019re finally able to take the first steps on a project we\u2019ve been wanting to do for some time: make masteries matter! Our specific goal with this year\u2019s mastery revamp is to make the mastery tree a more impactful part of how you play. Do you like being a wall for your allies?  Bursting out a squishy? Making a quick escape? Hopefully the mastery system can finally begin to serve one of its original purposes: providing players with interesting ways to optimize their characters that speaks to their playstyle.   
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019re not going too crazy here, mind you, we still feel that overall champions and items are the best way to offer meaningful character differentiation. But we do believe that the improvements we\u2019ve made to the system will result in a lot more players asking the question, \u201cWhat do I want in my **Talon** mastery page?\u201d instead of \u201cwhat do I want in my **offensive AD character X** page?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;You\u2019ve all probably seen [the website](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html) but I\u2019m going to highlight some things:  
&gt;  
&gt;* Ferocity is meant to favor marksmen, melee carries, and sustained damage mages. Resolve is meant to favor tanks, divers, and juggernauts. The old Utility tree has been done away with in favor of \u201cCunning,\u201d a new tree that offers some interesting stuff for a number of supports, assassins, and burst mages.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Points in each row are exclusive so if you find the flat pen in tier 3 Cunning particularly attractive, you\u2019re going to have to give up the cooldown reduction that\u2019s right next to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;* The power per mastery point has been redistributed to heavily favor the tier 3 masteries found deep in the trees. This results in a new allocation layout, while it used to be standard to spend variations of 21-9-0 in the old trees you\u2019ll now be looking to spend 18-12-0 or 18-6-6  
&gt;  
&gt;* We\u2019ve also thrown in a number of awesome usability improvements that should make the entire act of setting up a page far less painless (THANKS ENGINEERS!). Clicking on a 5 point mastery will automatically dump all 5 points into it if you have that many to spend. That\u2019s great for those crucial 10 seconds after you find out that the Blitzcrank on your team had no plans of ever going support!  
&gt;  
&gt;* You no longer have to take points out of a tree to reallocate points invested earlier, simply click on the new option you want and it\u2019ll be swapped with whatever you\u2019d already spent point on in that row.  
&gt;  
&gt;* An icon representing which tier 3 keystone each player took can be found on the loading screen and scoreboard, next to summoner spells.  Going to be a lot harder for that all offense AD Soraka to cheese you out when you have a better idea of what she invested in.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before moving on, I\u2019d just like to highlight how freeing the new exclusivity changes are, design wise. Under the old system, if we put a bunch of powerful stuff deep in the offense tree, you would just take it all. Because of this, power on any individual mastery had to be tuned low and 21 pointers had to be pretty generalized - we were basically balancing for Kayle. No longer! With the addition of exclusivity between masteries in the same tier, we can finally make things speak to specific classes of a champion, instead of \u201chas a pulse and a basic attack.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;So then after taking a look at the tree some of you may be thinking, \u201cWTF MAN I PLAY AP JINX AND *CLEARLY* THE ONLY THING WORTH TAKING FOR ME HERE IS MASTERY X.  MASTERIES DON\u2019T MATTER! WHERE ARE MY MEANINGFUL CHOICES!?\u201d Well... to be honest, that\u2019s not the primary goal here.  What we want is for every champion to feel like there\u2019s a mastery path **for them.** More specifically, we\u2019re hoping to draw out and amplify some of the cool things your champion\u2019s kit ***does,*** instead of just loading on general power.  
&gt;  
&gt;As an example, while Janna may appreciate +10% AP, she\u2019s going to feel much more excited about a +10% amp to shields and heals. One of these stats is for almost everyone, but the other speaks to a number of specific supports. Choice in the system is a secondary goal that, while nice to have, is not as important. There\u2019s 126 champions out there and limited space in the tree, so we\u2019d prefer a world where Soraka and Brand both have 1 path that speaks to them, instead of Brand getting 2 and Soraka crying in the corner. That said, giving players meaningful choices is still an important goal, so we\u2019re trying to add it into the trees where we can. We just may not be able to do it for EVERY champion. Also looking at it in other places this preseason, like the item system.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, a final awesome thing about this new system is that it\u2019s expandable! Remember how the old trees could have up to 4 points per row? Yeah, well we didn\u2019t get rid of that functionality. Things look sparse now but that\u2019s been done intentionally so we can add to the system should the need or want arise further into new season. This is where your feedback comes in.  Think there\u2019s no tier 2 keystones for tanky guys who want a little offense on the side? Let us know, we could add that! Think it would be hella sick if Fiddlesticks had a tier 3 keystone that made his AoE wombo even stupider? Please no, but if you have something that could do that in healthy and exciting way then maybe we could find a place to add it! In the words of Syndra, \u201c[the space to add new stuff to masteries] blah blah blah potential is limitless!\u201d Throw your ideas and wants and feels at us and if there truly is something missing or something that \u201dASDF WE NEED THIS\u201d then we might end up adding it in!

 **Season 6 does 3 things to make teleport worse mid and top.**

&gt;They are -   
&gt;  
&gt;**_The Rift Herald_** - There's a new Jungle mob that spawns at four minutes in the baron pit, and respawns 5 minutes after being killed. It disappears at 19:45 to make room for baron, or 19:55 if it was in combat. It\u2019s a tanky, high dps (much higher than dragon) mutated scuttle crab, with an eye on its back that opens on occasion. The eye can\u2019t be hit by the person tanking, but someone else can hit it for 15% of its max hp in True damage - more than smite. This allows two people to take it quite quickly, while it is nearly impossible to take one on one. When killed, it gives everyone on the killers team 50 gold, and the killer itself a mini-baron buff. The buff grants 10% increased damage, but not True damage, 40 movespeed, a 40% buff to nearby minion attack speeds, and the 4 second recall of baron buff. While not as important as dragon, this objective gives top lane a strategic objective beyond just turrets, which in turn makes ignite or exhaust taken for lane dominance stronger relative to TP, and gives junglers and mid laners more incentive to gank or pressure either lane - top lane to take the herald (and top tower with the minion buff), or bot lane to distract the other team while top and the other take it. Overall, it\u2019s a great strategic addition that will make top lane less of an island while lowering the dominance of TP, as TP is no longer necessary for top laners to influence the rest of the game pre-20 minutes in, as well as bringing reason for influence to come to them.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_Lowered XP and higher gold from jungle mobs for non-junglers_** - The jungle items were shifted from giving bonus gold on monsters kills to bonus experience, while monsters XP was shifted down and their gold shifted up to compensate. This is almost entirely due to the dominance of top lane either double jungling, were they tank two camps for the jungler, leaching xp and killing the small monsters, so that they both get level two with the jungler at full health, or the top lanner taking a camp for themselfs level one, then in either case recalling and teleporting top with extra potions and level 2. Once a again, this is a nerf to TP.  
&gt;___  
&gt;**_ And of course, a straight nerf to Teleport_** - TP no longer gets a 60 second lower CD for teleporting to towers. In all honesty, I would've kept that and instead just increased its CD by 30 seconds in both cases. The real issues are the jungling issues above, that TP is the best summoner mid asides from flash, TP being even better than flash top, and frequent teleports to lane wards bot lane to capitalize on overextension/aggression. This has really made bot lane much more passive than it used to. TP\u2019s high usage is largely symptomatic of top lane being so strategically non-optimal for junglers and mid to roam to (In high tier play, a jungler or mid being spotted top, at least without TP, means the that the other team takes drag) TP is the only way top laners can see any action before 25 minutes, of ignite being use-impaired top and mid lane thanks to barrier, the meta, it\u2019s low range, common shielding items, and current support picks (caugh caugh Tahm) countering the bursty playstyle that traditionally got ignite. This nerf however,  is largely negated by the 15% cdr reduction on summoner spells early on in the defensive tree, and therefore quite accessible to any top or mid that wants it. Boots of lucidity now grant another 10% cdr on summoner spells, and are cheaper, while the distortion upgrade is much more viable thanks to a replacement of the near mandatory (or at least, the most noticeable and fun) homeguard upgrade with a buff enabled on everyone at the 20 minute mark, although this isn\u2019t shipping with 5.22. Still, the CDR works with all summoners, so while it adds the lost power back to TP, it adds power to non-nerfed summoners as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;We're with you on Kindred being too strong, we've got a couple of other things we want to hit in 5.22 before considering whether further nerfs are needed though. The first of those is Kindred's base HP regen, which is really high. We'd overestimated how much regen they'd need to function as a short range, often jungling, marksmen, so we're cutting that down a bunch (10 -&gt; 7). The other change is a bug fix to Kindred's passive since its damage to neutral monsters isn't being capped as intended. That leads to some really fast dragon/baron kills, which in some games at least is likely adding a pretty significant amount of power.   
&gt;  
&gt;On top of those Kindred specific changes there are also some pretty significant general changes to the game in general in 5.22 that'll impact Kindred (masteries and marksmen items especially). Getting a read on those before assessing things like Kindred's passive damage or ult details is also going to be pretty valuable.

 **It now costs exactly 800 gold to completely shut down an entire class of champions.**

&gt;New executioner's calling will cost 800 gold, and applies grevious wounds for 3 seconds on every hit. Not the hits below a certain % of health, just every single hit. And the item it upgrades into not only gives APen, it applies the wounds for 5 seconds instead.   
&gt;  
&gt;So now any time that you want to play a sustain champ (Mundo, Vlad, Warwick, Aattrox, etc) don't, because it costs exactly 800 gold and 1 auto attack to render you almost completely useless. They removed the original executioner's calling because it didn't have enough counterplay for sustain champions. Apparently making it apply on every auto instead of just one's below 40% health gives it enough counterplay to completely destroy sustain tanks.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ah, well, back to playing ADCS for literally every role.

 **@Meddler: Syndra W idea?**

&gt;So a while back (~3 months ago) RiotMeddler was discussing some Syndra updates, the original found [here](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/08/820-pbe-update.html#balance) and conversation found [here-1](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Lq63Tvvw-syndra-buffs-d-o-3?comment=00040000), [here-2](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Lq63Tvvw-syndra-buffs-d-o-3?comment=0004000000020000), [here-3](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Lq63Tvvw-syndra-buffs-d-o-3?comment=000400000002000000000000), and [here-4](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Lq63Tvvw-syndra-buffs-d-o-3?comment=0004000000000000).  
&gt;  
&gt;And looking back, then forward, with the new season she could use some well deserved buffs, namely focused around her W at rank 5.   
&gt;  
&gt;___  
&gt;  
&gt;#The Current W  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;*FIRST ACTIVE*: Syndra telekinetically grabs a Dark Sphere, enemy minion or monster for 5 seconds. If a Dark Sphere is grabbed, its duration is refreshed. If a minion or monster is grabbed, it's put in Stasis icon stasis.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;*SECOND ACTIVE*: Syndra throws the grasped Dark Sphere or enemy to the target area, granting Sight icon sight of the projectile's surroundings as they fall. The projectile, if it is an enemy, and any enemies struck take magic damage and are Slow icon slowed for 1.5 seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;*TRANSCENDENT BONUS*: Force of Will's Slow icon slow duration is increased to 2 seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking at the ability, the bonus gained from attaining rank 5 is rather lackluster. Here are my proposted changes:  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;*TRANSCENDENT BONUS*: Syndra no longer drops any Dark Spheres after **3** seconds. Instead, the spell goes on a reduced cooldown (reduce by 50%, 4 seconds or 2.4 seconds with max CDR; in both cases exactly the cooldown of Q) and the Dark Sphere is added to her Q as ammo to an ammo system. She may carry up to 3 Dark Spheres. **She does not naturally generate ammo.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In introducing this change, it would have several effects:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Yes, Syndra's W loses its 2 second slow while at rank 5- but what it gains is a massive level 12 powerspike.   
&gt;  
&gt;2) Syndra players now have two options with their W: pick up a ball or minion now, and (with the increased range compared to Q) throw the ball immediately for the slow, and with the reduced time held she has less of a window to act and possibly make a pick. Or the could hold the ball, add it to their Q's inventory and have more potential for burst damage.   
&gt;  
&gt;3) By putting Q's Dark Spheres on an ammo system, but at a later level independent to the ability, it improves her ability to zone as a Zone-of-Control mage. It forces Syndra players to decide between leveling her W for potentially more burst and more AoE's, or leveling her E for peel and long range stuns.   
&gt;  
&gt;4) While this would result in a net increase in the damage on her ult, as well as the number of projectiles that could be fired by her E, the amount of preparation needed would be worth it: to pick up 3 Dark Spheres she would have to cast Q three times, then pick up each Sphere while already on the ground.   
&gt;  
&gt;5) On a side note, it would definitely improve support Syndra: maxing W first could be a viable option, Giving her the ability to set up better stuns with Q+Q+E in rapid succession. While she did lose the slow, she rarely used the full slow on W without immediately using E for a long range stun.   
&gt;  
&gt;Syndra used to be played competitively and among the highest ranks of league, known for her high damage and zoning skills. But slowly she has fallen out of favor for alternative high damage mages- with these changes I feel like she could make a return without being oppressive or overpowered. It fits her character, evolving to become more chaotic with her spellcasting, her slowly becoming more frustrated, blasting more and more spells out in her quest for more and more power. And, this fits her playstyle- she doesn't need the utility of a mana-return, and a short silence would not benefit her combo.  
&gt;

&gt;   * **1 Acquired Taste's:** 20 (+ 1 / 3 / 5% bonus health)  
&gt;   * **2 Acquired Taste's:** 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health)  
&gt;   * **3 Acquired Taste's:** 20 (+ 7 / 9 / 11% bonus health)  
&gt;* **ACTIVE:** Tahm Kench channels for up to 15 seconds, highlighting the path to his intended destination to allies while opening his maw to offer up to one allied champion the chance to come with him. Once an ally has climbed in or if Tahm Kench decides to go solo by Abyssal Voyage 2 reactivating Abyssal Voyage, he begins a 1-second channel which, upon completion, blinks him and his ally to the target location, arriving after a 0.5-second delay. When arriving to targets location he gains bonus movement speed, which doubles when moving toward an enemy champion for 3 seconds. This bonus only aplies when he brought an ally with him in his ult. If he didn't bring a ally with him. His W will not go on 3 second cooldown.  
&gt;  
&gt;  Taking damage interrupts Abyssal Voyage, putting it on a 10-second reduced cooldown. Abyssal Voyage cannot be activated while Devour his belly is full.  
&gt;   * **MOVEMENT SPEED (only when taking an ally with him in his ult):** 15 / 17.5 / 20 / 22.5 / 25% (same as his W)  
&gt;  
&gt;----  
&gt;  
&gt;#Context  
&gt;  
&gt;This change will put more power into his short combo's while reducing some of his sustain damage. Since his W removes his Acquired Taste's stacks his damage output in longer fights will be lower. Unless he intentionaly doesn't Devour his target what he now in certain situations actualy can do. This gives him a lot more options when it comes to role diversity. For example while dueling a champion you normally would want to devour your target as fast as possible. But now vs certain enemies you will probaly would rather wait &amp; deal some more damage giving your enemy more roam to fight back. This change could help him a lot for his toplane role where he could force longer fights if he wants to.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest nerf with this so called tweak will be his jungle role. His clear will be a lot slower. However the R active is sligtly more impactfull now. This would shift his more back to the utility he can provide rather than just his raw damage output. I actualy think it's better than just straight out nerf the number.  
&gt;  
&gt;For his support role it's still a nerf to his damage. You generaly doesn't have the stickyness to aply a lot of stacks to your targets. You have to keep in mind you will rarely have the change to auto attack after aplying 3 stacks to your target. Think like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;* You Q your target: 20 damage &gt; target now has 1 stack  
&gt;* You auto your target: 20 (+ 1 / 3 / 5% bonus health) &gt; target now has 2 stacks  
&gt;* You auto your target: 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health) &gt; target now has 3 stacks  
&gt;* You devour your target: 20 (+ 7 / 9 / 11% bonus health), we nerf W so it deals about the same damage it deals now.  
&gt;* Enemy has no more stacks so the circle repeats  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently we have it's like this  
&gt;  
&gt;* You Q your target: 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health) &gt; target now has 1 stack  
&gt;* You auto your target: 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health) &gt; target now has 2 stacks  
&gt;* You auto your target: 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health) &gt; target now has 3 stacks  
&gt;* You devour your target: 20 (+ 4 / 6 / 8% bonus health)  
&gt;* Enemy has no more stacks so the circle repeats  
&gt;  
&gt;So 4% vs 1%, 4% vs 4%. This means his combo will deals 3%  bonus health damage less.  
&gt;  
&gt;This ult active buff is to compensate for the jungle nerf &amp; to solve one strange issue in his kit. Currently Tahm cannot use his W for 3 seconds after using his ult. To ballance this out, Tahm now doesn't have this when he flies solo &amp; when he does take an ally with his he get something to compensate.

 **Taric Rework Ideas**

&gt;So, while I realize the champion design team already has the majority of the Taric rework laid out, I've had these ideas for skills in my head for a while now, and thought that I'd share them to see everyone's thoughts.  
&gt;  
&gt;This kit reflects what I believe to be a champion that, while easy to understand and play for beginners, also has a very high skill ceiling, and rewards skilled play.  
&gt;  
&gt;Passive: Jeweled Armor  
&gt;  
&gt;	Taric\u2019s abilities apply Jeweled Armor to allies, increasing their armor by (base)(scaling w/ taric\u2019s armor) for (scaling) seconds.   
&gt;  
&gt;Q: Imbue  
&gt;  
&gt;	Taric reflects a beam of light in a line, healing allies for (base + scaling ap), and damaging allies for (base + scaling ap). If an ally has Jeweled armor, the heal increases to (larger base + slightly larger scaling ap)  
&gt;  
&gt;	Leveling up: Increased mana cost, decreased cooldown, increased heal.  
&gt;  
&gt;W: Gem Storm  
&gt;  
&gt;	Taric surrounds himself with sharp rocks, increasing his armor by (base%) for (x) seconds. After the duration, the gems explode outwards, dealing (scaling armor) damage to enemies and slowing them by a small amount.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Level up: Increased base scale, increased base armor % increase, small increased slow.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: Crystal Fracture  
&gt;  
&gt;	Taric creates an area of crystals on the field, slowing enemies. After a moment, crystal pillars erupt from the ground, dealing (base + scaling ap) damage and stunning enemies caught in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Level up: Increased mana, Increased slow, Increased stun duration.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Prismatic Radiance.  
&gt;  
&gt;	After a brief channel, brilliant beams of light erupt from Taric\u2019s armor. Each beam reflects to an ally with Jeweled Armor, before being channeled onto an enemy. Enemies hit are damaged for (base + scaling ap) and stunned for ~1.5 seconds.   
&gt;  
&gt;	Each beam of light bounces to the nearest enemy. Enemies can only be hit by one beam.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Level up: Increase mana cost, decreased cooldown, increased damage.

 **Why buffing Cinderhulk would cause more problems than it solves.**

&gt;There's a very popular post on the forms right now claiming that rather than Sion and Sejuani being too weak, Cinderhulk is too weak. The post largely accomplishes this by pointing out the bottom 5 win rate junglers on champion.gg, Gragas, Olaf, Nautilus, Maokai, and Rek'sai, are Cinderhulk users.   
&gt;  
&gt;They then fail to mention that all 5 of these champions have been nerfed severely because of their strengths and popularity in pro play, that two of them, Gragas and Rek'sai, were played just slightly less than every other jungler combined in this year's worlds, or that 6 of the top 20 junglers by win-rate are dedicated Cinderhulk uses, with many of the 14 others flexing into it. Cinderhulk junglers are as a whole performing about as well as every other jungle item, which like all the others, includes quite a lot of variance between its users. The only reason the five lowest win rate jungler use Cinderhulk is because tanks with high reliability and teamfighting utility dominate the pro scene whenever they are strong, and therefor the worst offenders get repeatedly nerfed in order to make room for other options.  
&gt;  
&gt;As[ I detail in my last post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gOYJEpoz-the-state-of-marksmen-part-3-what-why-and-how-the-preseason-changes-the-game-megapost), strong damage itemization for tanks in Cinderhulk and Thornmail crowded out typical damage junglers for a good part of this season, just like anytime itemization lets one class fulfill the roles of another while still fulfilling their own. Thanks to innate armor or HP scalings many tanks are already uniquely problematic at beating other roles at their own game whenever they have strong itemization, and brutal DPS options, like the writer of the post calling Cinderhulk underpowered wants, would trivialize every other option.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no easy solution to the performance disparities between junglers, but it's not from one jungle item being too weak or too strong overall right now. Certainly, some champions utilize certain jungler items better than others, but as a whole right now this comes down to individual champions, not the items relative power towards each other.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pre season brings about quite a few changes to the jungle, which[ I detailed in my last post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gOYJEpoz-the-state-of-marksmen-part-3-what-why-and-how-the-preseason-changes-the-game-megapost), as well as some itemization changes that make tanks considerably stronger, which I'll detail in my next post. I have hopes that these will being greater variety to the game, unlike the complete removal of champion that wasn't a hyper carry, a support, or tank like the Cinderhulk meta did, despite any False nostalgia.

[Fisk wrote on 2015-11-09 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cbJmET0T-support-itemization-feels-lacking):

 **Support Itemization feels... Lacking...**

&gt;Just throwing this out there but, as a platinum support main, I feel like supports don't have nearly enough carry power. They find themselves underfed and honestly don't have nearly enough utility to make up for this. The support item changes may help, especially since the items are getting increased gold generation but I don't know if it will be enough. As a support main though, here's what I would like to see:   
&gt;  
&gt;Well, before we dive in I'd like to clarify my idea behind types of supports and which ones are lacking and where each type needs buffs. Please keep in mind they overlap at points.   
&gt;  
&gt;First, you have your utility supports. Don't do much damage overall and have little tank but AWESOME utility value. These guys are supports like {{champion:432}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:267}}  {{champion:40}} and {{champion:16}} .   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Next you have your tanks. Generally they are engagers with heavy CC and natural beef. These guys are champs like {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}} and {{champion:111}}.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, you have your damage dealing mage supports that really on CC and utility+powerful early lane damage to snowball games. These guys are stuff like {{champion:1}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:143}} and {{champion:63}}. Alright lets get started now that's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;First: More support geared itemization. Sure, they have the support items with actives and now the new sight stone but honestly there isn't a lot of  diversity. Every game you will generally see the support item+aegis+sightstone combination on virtually every support, then they are generally left to build tank+ap. Ardent censer and zekes harbinger are good addition but simply aren't enough and don't cater to very many supports.   
&gt;  
&gt;Solution: I would like to see itemization for tank and utility focused supports. I really, really like the idea zeke's has of binding onto an ally and granting meaningful buffs under a certain condition+useful stats, so I'd like to see an item like this for each type of support.   
&gt;  
&gt;For example: Shurima's Calling  
&gt;Builds from: {{item:2053}} and {{item:3114}} + 550 Gold  
&gt;Grants 50 armor, 150% health regen, 150% mana regen and 10% CDR.  
&gt;Unique Passive: Momentum (upgraded point runner)- Bind to an ally. When you and your ally are within x range of eachother, gain up to 40% movement speed. Increased by 50% when near structures. Additionally, once you have maximum momentum, you and your ally's health and mana regeneration is increased by 50%. Momentum quickly decays when you leave your ally or when you stop moving (includes being cc'd, only one person has to move to stack momentum but stacks slowly unless both move).   
&gt;  
&gt;Or   
&gt;  
&gt;Solari's Blessing  
&gt;Builds from:  {{item:3067}} + {{item:3751}} + 600 Gold   
&gt;Grants  500 health and 10% CDR  
&gt;Unique Passive: Immolate   
&gt;Martyr- Bind to an ally. When the ally you are bound to is within x range and has taken 50% of their health in damage within x amount of seconds, both you and your ally gain a 100+(20*(your level)) shield and you take 40% of damage dealt to your ally instead of them.   
&gt;  
&gt;These items would provide powerful and meaningful options to supports who want more items but are limited severely by current item choices (namely are friends the utility and tank supports).   
&gt;  
&gt;Second: make squishy supports have a fall back plan. You can't play things like sona, nami, or zyra (no particular architype here actually just suqishy supports in general are suffering at the moment) because they get dived/ganked/etc and then get instagibbed. Then, once they fall behind, they continue to get instagibbed until they have fed good and nice.    
&gt;  
&gt;Solution: I want some utility geared itemization that benefits then in lane. This means, items that give them some form of extra power to avoid being dived early/mid game and giving them some form of meaningful defensive itemization paths early..   
&gt;  
&gt;For example   
&gt;Saint's Touch-   
&gt;Builds from  {{item:3028}}+ {{item:3024}} +400 gold.  
&gt;Grants  50% mana regen, 50 armor, and 30 MR, 250 mana and 10% CDR.  
&gt;Unique Passive: Mana Font  
&gt;Unique Passive: Point Runner  
&gt;Unique Passive: Safeguard- Upon taking 40% of your hp in damage, the armor and MR bonuses from this item are double for 5 seconds (60 second CD)  
&gt;  
&gt;This item's active would be similar to something like {{item:3102}}. It would be a way for squishy supports to grab a little bit of mana sustain, cdr and mana (all really helpful for early game supports) while avoiding getting instantly killed.   
&gt;  
&gt;These are all just concepts and of course can be changed and tweaked but I just thought these would be cool additions.  
&gt;Edit: changed up Solari's Blessing to include bami's cinder.

[Meddler wrote on 2015-11-09 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EkxbfyvO-so-lemme-get-this-straight?comment=0008):

&gt;Some thoughts on the current state of Sona:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. There are a number of Sona players who find Sona unsatisfying and feel she needs to be buffed, including some players posting on Boards who've felt that way at least since her rework last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Sona's performance in game, outside of organized professional play, is in a pretty reasonable spot, even in high Elo solo queue. She's also got a bit of the Amumu/Yi effectiveness by Elo curve going on, where she'll be pretty dominant in average games if she's a strong pick in high tier play. That matches up with her play rate, which is quite a bit higher (2-3 times on average, depending on the region) in average Elo ranges versus high Elo. That puts Sona at a pretty average play rate at most tiers of play, though does mean she's underrepresented in high tier play..    
&gt;  
&gt;3. Sona's got a kit design that makes it really hard for her power to be satisfying. Her power's split between spell casts that affect multiple targets, auras that can affect multiple allies and power chord effects. That means each individual effect has to be pretty weak and therefore hard to feel, let alone feel good about.  
&gt;4. Sona's got a really high reliability kit. Provided you've got at least a moderate handle on how her kit works you're going to see fairly consistent output from her. Because her lows aren't very low that also contrains our ability to give her high highs.   
&gt;  
&gt;5. Sona's auras are powerful ally buffing effects with a high uptime. That means if solo lane Sona's ever in a spot where she's a solid, satisfying pick duo lane Sona's almost certainly pretty overpowered (since she's able to access her full effectiveness by contrast). That issue could potentially be addressed by adding a mechanic to Sona that's only useful if she's solo laning, though that runs the risk of feeling really forced and post laning adds yet another mechanic to a kit that's already splitting its power into a lot of pieces as above.  
&gt;  
&gt;6. In terms of where that leaves us we could introduce some less reliable abilities and concentrate power (e.g. by removing auras, power chord or multi hit spells and in exchange buffing the remaining elements) to address points 3 and 4 above. That would lead to a drastically different Sona however. There might also be room for some small QoL or buffs, and I expect Sona will be discussed again internally after preseason follow up's on a good track (though I'm personally doubtful we've got much power to work with and simply buffing Sona until she feels good's going to set her up for a nerf).

&gt;Glad to hear you're enjoying Kindred. Ability to take neutral objectives pretty quickly is a strength we want to see on Kindred, at present though they're not just quick but incredibly quick hence the need for a cap. Current plan is for a cap that increases slightly with number of passive stacks Kindred has (75 base + 10 per stack), so that they're still getting some increased objective control over time, without going too nuts.

 **@Meddler Any Big assassin Update planned**

&gt;{{champion:84}}   
&gt;{{champion:55}}   
&gt;{{champion:91}}   
&gt;{{champion:121}}   
&gt;{{champion:35}}   
&gt;{{champion:56}}   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;could really use some love!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:84}}  : way to hard countered by Pinks. feels like her W and E are useless filler. they dont feel impactful at all and i dont want to see the E+ Q combo come back. i think its time to give her some new skills or rework these skills  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:55}} way to feast or famine and can be very stressful to play against. She is also the only AP melee fighter thats given zero tools to actually go head to head in melee. (kassidin has a empowered rightclick taht does hefty damage ,a shield and a non target oriented mobility tool on a short CD, Akali has tons of Damage ,stealth and lots of spell and lifesteal, Ekko has W and his Ult rewind for a quick heal not to mention his passive which does %hp damage and becomes more lethal the lower you get,Nidalee has cougar form to deal tons of damage and  can quickly dispatch squishy people, Fizz has tons of damage on W and trollpole he also has a unrespected amount of mobility through Q and E, Diana has TWO shields and the VERY powerful cleave per 3 autos.Elise has a execute and Skittering Frenzy.)   
&gt;  
&gt;Katarina is boasted as a agile fighter who potent at melee but christ she is absolutely horrid at it.  
&gt;the damage on her ult seems way to high and while her Q+W feel very cohesive and nice It feels like she could have something a bit better  
&gt;  
&gt;I recommend changing up her base stats and giving her more tools to survive in melee. ever notice how in EVERY SINGLE cinematic she is in she is dodging attacks? yeah do that please :).  
&gt;(And for those of you that might live under a rock):  
&gt;http://31.media.tumblr.com/b78bbdb3ddf1b331902afe8832aae7a8/tumblr_n4v1m5DN4j1tvfueno2_250.gif  
&gt;http://cdn.yourepeat.com/media/gif/000/631/261/f747597b1b28e6ae64dcbc698eda2a0d.gif  
&gt;  
&gt;http://orig12.deviantart.net/7afb/f/2013/076/9/6/lol3_by_clifferock-d5yc28e.gif  
&gt;  
&gt;for instance what If E'ing against a target marked by Q triggered a special animation where Katarina attacks them During her Shunpo animation and consumes the mark this way people would not need to rely on W for triggering  marks and W could be something else like:  
&gt;Killer Reflexes- Katarina bluffs a relaxed state for 1.5 seconds then counter attacks the first single target ability or Auto attack made against her striking back for (260(80% AP) (100% total AD)) physical damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:91}}  its not that Talon is weak or anything as a matter of fact he is in a pretty good spot. There's a handful of Talon mains and he sees consistent play in high elo hell we even have SSW Talon as a testament to that. the only problem is Talon is by far the most stressful assassin in LoL. he has about the same reaction time that Rengar gives and it feels very unfair to play against him. the Range he can cover in a instant with flash and E is Disgusting often leaves players with a bad taste in thier mouth "Oh.. even though I was under tower he just flash+E 100-0'd me before my 50 calibur net even got done casting :/".  
&gt;  
&gt;I really don't want to see much on his kit changed but his damage should feel more spread out (I personally always thought Talon should operate somewhat similar to Taka from Vainglory where he Excels and hit and run strikes quickly culling one person from the back line then stealthing and making a run for it until he can find another opening).  
&gt;  
&gt;Id personally recommend looking at his Passive and E as they feel like the weakest links on his kit.  
&gt;maybe make shadow assualt more spammable for utility but significantly reducing the damage it deals (people doubletap it to burst mostly anyway instead of repositioning) and replace his passive with  a auto crit or bonus damage when attacking someone from a unseen angle (like kha'zix passive but with a much shorter frame of oppurtunity)  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:121}} Where do I even begin? this guy is the Skarner of Assassins he either dominates or under performs. His niche is the cleanup assassin that Jungles but the problem is there are much better picks (Rengar) and his kit cant feel too good without being OP.You guys over at Riot have tried just about everything to try to make get him in a good spot but it never seems to work. I would recommend looking into the whole Evolve gimmick again(For instance what if Evolving Claws gave Kha'Zix "adaptive" damage which meant if his target had more Armor than MR Kha6's autos and Q's would deal MAGIC damage instead of Physical!) and reevaluating his passive because it feels like thats kha'zixs whole playstyle should be based around but in truth the passive is the least  impactful item on Kha6's kit and its simply much better to just bide your time until you can E in execute E out)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:35}} Shaco doesnt need his kit changes just please for the love of god switch around his Ratios.  
&gt;  
&gt;AP is the most fun but AD is how your shoehorned into playing if you want teamfight presence. please look into making him either dedicated AP or dedicated AD. seriously Shaco is super fun but having to run around a fight waiting on E CD feels so bad.Its feels  like the character is split. You either get to have fun or you get to be effective. you dont get both.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:56}}   
&gt;this guy is just bad Reksai now. Id look into giving him a new W and making his E more impactful. Nocs base stats are so awful a simple sneeze will kill him in a teamfight if you go full AD for assassin. so he runs into a Dilemma  
&gt;  
&gt;either build bruiser and be a subpar bruiser (why would you want Noc over someone like Vi who does divebombing the carry better or Rek'sai who does map presence better BOTH of which have much better tank stats AND damage)  
&gt;Or  
&gt;build assassin and die nonstop generally fall off hard and be all-round useless  
&gt;

 **If the PBE buffs on Frostfang/ Frost Queen's claim go live, they'll be staples on AP Mids**

&gt;Frostfang costs a total of 850 gold on PBE, 15 less than on live, and grants 15 ap (Live gives 10), 100% mana regen (Live gives 50%), 2 gp 10, and the same Tribute passive, but which now gives 15 gold instead of 10.  
&gt;  
&gt;Frost Queen's claim is 2200 gold, same as live, and grants 50 ap (same as live), 150% mana regen (Live gives 50%, this is the highest in the game), 10% cdr (same as live), 2 gp 10, and tribute for 15 gold and damage, while live gives 10.   
&gt;  
&gt;The active on FQC is much stronger now - it's a stronger version of the Twin Shadows active. It sends out 2 spooky ghosts that find the 2 nearest champions (range ~ 6000 units, but subject to standard unit pathing) and slows them for 40% for 4 seconds. It gives mages very strong escape, chase, and vision, while letting them easily set up their combo.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, Frostfang, but not FQC, gets its tribute disabled for 12 seconds whenever you kill a minion. However, it continues to build stacks during that time, so you can unload all 3 stacks whenever you haven't killed any minions in the last 12 seconds. This happens pretty frequently.  
&gt;  
&gt;And FQC's tribute isn't disabled when you take CS.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've seen them as common items mid last time they were strong, and this time they're even stronger.

[QuincyMcCoy wrote on 2015-11-10 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/s0aETGVN-aatrox-rework-concept):

 **Aatrox Rework CONCEPT**

&gt;http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/92/Aatrox_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131016154403  
&gt;Alright, here is my idea on how to make an effective Aatrox Rework, not only to give him more of a strategic niche, but also to give him a chance to shine more truly with his lore.   
&gt;{My attempt to put this in a pretty format: [Click here](http://championcreatrix.com/league/champdisplay.php?sqlPass=34), in retrospect, this probably didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped from the beginning. So stick with the full text below in order to see all of my proposed changes.}  
&gt;  
&gt;**Passive: Blood Well**  
&gt;Unchanged. Stays exactly the same.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q: Darkin Inspiration** **NEW**  
&gt;Passive - Damaging an enemy champion with an attack or ability will cause all nearby allied minions to focus the damaged champion.  
&gt;Active: Increase the AD of all nearby allies for 7 seconds.  
&gt;AD INCREASE: 10/14/18/22/26 + (1 - 18 based on LEVEL)   
&gt;RANGE: 650   
&gt;COST: 10% CURRENT HEALTH   
&gt;COOLDOWN: 20/18/16/14/12  
&gt;  
&gt;**W: Blood Thirst / Blood Price**  
&gt;PASSIVE: Aatrox applies a bonus on-hit effect every third basic attack,_ in addition to reducing his basic ability cooldowns by 1 second_:  
&gt;BLOOD THIRST: Aatrox heals himself. The heal amount is tripled while Aatrox is below 50% maximum health.  
&gt;HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 25% bonus AD)  
&gt;BLOOD PRICE: Aatrox deals bonus physical damage.   
&gt;BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 100% bonus AD)   
&gt;COST: 15 / 23.75 / 32.5 / 41.25 / 50 (+ 25% bonus AD) HEALTH  
&gt;COOLDOWN: .5 seconds  
&gt;  
&gt;**E: Blades of Torment**  
&gt;Completely unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;**R: Call to Arms NEW**  
&gt;Aatrox channels the blood of his nearby allies, gaining 10% Blood well for each, then he duplicates all nearby allied minions, except for Siege minions. Additionally, Aatrox gains bonus attack speed and attack range for 12 seconds.  
&gt;ATTACK SPEED: 40 / 50 / 60%  BONUS RANGE: 325  
&gt;AOE RANGE: 550  
&gt;COOLDOWN: 100 / 85 / 70  
&gt;COST: 10%/5%/0% CURRENT HEALTH  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Notes on Changes:  
&gt;First and foremost, remember that this is a rework to make Aatrox more similar to what his lore depicts. With these changes, Aatrox would be an inspiration for allied forces, and he even causes armies to seemingly double in size! He would retain the life-steal based build and focus that he has today; however, he would be trading his gapcloser for a potent AD steroid for all allies in an AOE. This causes him to both boost the power of others, while allowing himself to drain even more off of the same number of attacks. To support the jungle playstyle, his W now has an additional CDR element, which allows his Devourer build to become even more scary as he is able to quickly double or triple stack his Q inspiration, if given the chance! But the main goal of these changes is to solidify Aatrox as a Drain Fighter who's main purpose in a team composition is to splitpush via minion manipulation. Right now we have items for that and high-waveclear champs, but the best I can think of in terms of minion boosting is Alistar's mass heal. So there is definitely a bit of design space in this area.  
&gt;  
&gt;While this may not solve all of Aatrox's problems, especially with Grevious Wounds being a thing again, it would cause Aatrox to have a bit more diversity in builds. It would also allow Aatrox to be able to hit like a truck using the minion aggro, and that's a neat mechanic that I think would prove very interesting, especially on a champion with a self-revive passive. After all, the goal with a rework should be to try and get a champion into a better niche and more accessible by more players, so why don't we give him a shot by solidifying his potential to splitpush and duel? But at the same time, these changes would not lock him entirely into this frame, because his Q affects your other champions as well, so Aatrox would fill a more 'support' role in teamfights, although one that focuses on boosting damage of the team instead of keeping your carries alive.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last note - I am definitely not an Aatrox main, so you guys will probably disagree with this direction, but what other directions do you think that Riot can try with him without completely and utterly blowing his current identity? And yes, this was designed in respect to the new AD items, and yes, I do realize that you can easily reach +100 or so AD using his Q and W CDR. I don't know, I think this would be a decent way to solve the issue of buildpaths for Aatrox, but that's just my idea on it! Feedback would be awesome, thanks!

 **Minion bug. Previous tickets have gone unanswered and unresolved**

&gt;Dear Rioteers and fellow players,  
&gt;  
&gt;A good friend of mine is having a LOT of problems with League of Legends currently and recently. Due to him being Finnish and his English (in writing) not being very good at all, I'm making this ticket on his behalf.   
&gt;IGN of account: Shadovi.  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem:  
&gt;After about 5 minutes, the game randomly decides whether or not he gets the 'world infamous' minion bug. He can NOT see minions, particles (including minion basic attacks and turret hits) and only see the champions that he could see at the moment of the bug. However, it doesn't happen in all games, it happens selectively, but to his own estimation close to 75-25. Sometimes he gets 4 hours of games in, zero bugs, other times he has the bug every game.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is especially disturbing for him himself, but also for his team and his enemy.   
&gt;  
&gt;He's been having this problem for a while now. He's not too technical, but we've done everything we could find related to the minion bug (temp folder fixes, League client repairs, complete League re-install) over Teamviewer. I have also made sure his graphical drivers are up to date.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most random thing is that it USUALLY happens around minute 5 ingame. If he plays beyond the first 7 minutes before any problems, he's usually home free.   
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes the game crashes as well, the following bugsplat does not generate an error report - it says that that his temp folder is full. We have tried most solutions to that bug as well and we're testing that currently.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any help, advice, tips, test, tricks?  
&gt;  
&gt;They would be greatly appreciated.   
&gt;  
&gt;Regards,  
&gt;  
&gt;A silver nub with a friend with a problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: His computer is more than fast enough for League (don't know the exact specs, but it's an early i5 with a nVidia GTX870m (iirc). Shadovi will be in this thread to answer any of your questions or to help you to dxdiag files etc. Please help him where you can!

&gt;  
&gt;Our goal was to make pathing through minions more predictable, with a specific focus on champions that could get \u2018stuck\u2019 while passing through. We also wanted to ensure we had full transparency on both sides of the \u2018code\u2019 fence - a player knows why they got stuck on the minions and we, as developers, could peek under the hood to see what\u2019s going on.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So why did these changes go out?**  
&gt;If you think of the League of Legends game (note: not things like the client) as large \u2018layers\u2019 of functionality, you will get three major layers.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Engine: The thing that comprises the fundamental building blocks to build everything else. This has been cleaned up pretty extensively (and we\u2019ll continue doing work here!) over the last couple years. You can think of the Engine layer as the foundation that we\u2019re building everything on top of.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Game: The \u2018house\u2019 we\u2019ve built on the foundation of the Engine. You can think of each Game system in League like an individual room in the house, with one for, say, pathing, or another one for minion AI, etc. Since most systems are self-enclosed (to a degree), we\u2019ve basically been going from room to room to clean up where possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Content: Maybe the\u2026 interior decoration and furniture in the house? These are the individual things you interact with. Champions. Items. Maps. This isn\u2019t much actual code, but more scripts. Stuff built with the tools provided on the layers before it. This is still messy, but we\u2019re not really talking about content today.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pathing sits in its own very isolated system within the \u2018Game\u2019 layer, and that system is a bit of a mess inside itself. Pathing also has some of the largest implications for how you play the game. When doing cleanups to the system, due to the risk of disruption and unknowability, we targeted preseason to keep it all (somewhat) contained.   
&gt;  
&gt;So we did.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Did anything work with this?**  
&gt;From an implementation standpoint, yes! In natural pathing situations, the new system appropriately identifies whether or not a unit should be stuck or not, or could get stuck if it goes a certain direction. In other words, it\u2019s *knowable* and predictable. A minion wall will act like a minion wall. If you jump to an area with lots of units around, you will be held there more surely.  
&gt;  
&gt;**But there were things that didn\u2019t work.**  
&gt;Knowable doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better, and more-so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean understandable when it interacts with other systems like pathfinding. Sure, minions make walls appropriately now, and stuck detection works. That said, behavior like that sucks when the shortest route the pathfinding system gives you is the longer way around. Additionally, from a direction standpoint, knowing that you\u2019re definitely going to be trapped is annoying when your expectation is simply not to be trapped at all. Blegh.  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, we have a predictable system that isn\u2019t playing nicely with other systems, and when it does work it\u2019s a little more frustrating than we\u2019d like.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So what we're doing**  
&gt;We presumed things could go bad. We haven\u2019t done fundamental (and I mean, very fundamental beyond light tweaks) work on pathing in... 5 years?  
&gt;  
&gt;The new system was built with the assumption that it might cause issues with the old. As such\u2026 **we'll be switching it back to the old behavior in all of its unknowable glory** while we work on and dig more into the pathing system.  
&gt;  
&gt;This will be in 5.24 for everyone, but we\u2019ll test it first on EUW to make sure nothing goes crazy.

 **Platinum Team LF Top laner, and coaching staff for a sister team**

&gt;Hello,   
&gt;Arcane is an organization that for almost a year has utilized a full support staff, video recording review, scrims between its 2 teams, and a serious 5s atmosphere to increase both individual and team growth. This strategy has seen explosive and consistent growth in both of its 5s teams. The end goal of each team is to contend for the challenger series sometime in the near future, as well as make money from online tournaments and events.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both teams contain their own:  
&gt;-General Manager  
&gt;-Head Coach  
&gt;-Schedule &amp; Practice Doc / Stat sheets  
&gt;  
&gt;Each month a practice schedule is released. This generally is 4 nights a week, around 4 hours each night. Players are expected to make most practices, and inform coaching staff 24 hours in advance if you can not.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Arcane, there is no A or B team. The different teams are always competing to win during scrims, but they are treated the same by all staff.  
&gt;  
&gt;Due to a series of personal and team events, the rosters of each team have taken a serious blow. The organization is now open to tryout strong replacements for the following position for each team:  
&gt;  
&gt;Arcane Ferocity  
&gt;-Top Lane  
&gt;  
&gt;Arcane Brutality  
&gt;-Head Coach  
&gt;-Asst. Coach  
&gt;-Analyst  
&gt;**For those wishing to tryout for a management position on Arcane Brutality please add Ninja AF on the league client.**  
&gt;===========================================  
&gt;  
&gt;General Requirements of Players:  
&gt;-Overall Positive attitude - being critical of teammates is fine - uneeded negativity is not.  
&gt;-Plat III+  
&gt;-Available to practice solo-que as well as make practices  
&gt;-Willing to put effort both in and out of practice to become a better player  
&gt;-Most show noticeable improvement over sensible amount of time  
&gt;-Drive to win  
&gt;-If you make the team, you must add the "AF" or "AB" to your name within 2 weeks.  
&gt;============================================  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are at all interested, please fill out the following short form. It takes around 2 - 3 minutes. If you still have any remaining questions, whether about the tryouts, organization, or history of the teams, feel free to add the head coach of AF, Ninja AF.

[Riot Jatt wrote on 2015-09-15 UTC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/NlpIcaTl-group-a-preview-and-predictions):

 **Group A preview and predictions**

&gt;Since the end of the LCS split I have been prepping hard for worlds. I am by no means done, but I wanted to give a preview of what I\u2019m currently thinking as we get closer to the World Championship.   
&gt;  
&gt;What better way than a group A preview? What would each team need to do to finish 1st in their group? What would have to go wrong for a team to fail out of group stage? Here are my thoughts so far.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Group A**  
&gt;  
&gt;CLG, FW, KOO, PAIN  
&gt;  
&gt;Group A is the only group that doesn\u2019t have a team from the LPL. In my view, the LPL consists of 3 of the 4 strongest teams heading into worlds, with SKT being the only team outside the LPL to crack the top 4. Because there is no clear juggernaut in this group, it is super interesting to me and has a ton of possibilities. This is the \u201cweakest\u201d group at worlds, but also the one with the most possibilities.   
&gt;  
&gt;**CLG**  
&gt;  
&gt;- After a 13-5 regular season, where they lost the tiebreaker for 1st seed to TL, CLG went on a 6-0 run in the playoffs and topped NA to get the #1 seed.  
&gt;  
&gt;- The faithful shall be rewarded! Or shall they? Early issues point to Xmithie not being able to attend due to Visa issues, with Huhi (the teams sub mid-laner) taking over the jungle position.  
&gt;  
&gt;- There is also the chance that Huhi is an upgrade to Xmithie in the jungle. Huhi was consistently near the top of the solo Q ladder when he was in the challenger scene, and has reportedly been heavily involved in CLG\u2019s team practice for over 4 months. The team also says scrims are executing at a level equal or better to that of the NA Playoffs, so this could actually make CLG better than ever. Additionally, while it\u2019s normally daunting for a player to role swap, jungling in competitive play is much different than jungling in solo Q. I would also say that CLG\u2019s role for Xmithie is even different than most competitive junglers. Xmithie bought substantially more sight wards (literally more than double) than any other jungler in NA, and also bought the most pinks by a wide margin. Note that most sight-wards bought by junglers are pre-sightstone, so having a high number here usually makes you slow to completing your jungle enchant and delays your power spike. Xmithies\u2019 role in the early game is generally to fall behind in order to get ward control before the opponent. Then, he actually goes to farming his jungle to make up his XP and farm disadvantage for the team-fight phase. It really is a style unique to CLG.  
&gt;  
&gt;- When CLG is at their best, they are one of the most entertaining teams to watch in the world. They consistently make high-risk, high-reward plays and smother the opposition before they have time to react. During the spring split and even the summer, CLG manhandled teams so badly in the early game that it overshadowed the fact that they weren\u2019t picking strong overall team compositions, and often didn\u2019t have concrete ways to end games outside of \u201cbeat them to death in the early game\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 1st**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By performing to their potential in every role. ZionSpartan has waited his entire career to play on the world stage, and his domination of TSM in the NA finals was his display of how he can play when he\u2019s at his best.  
&gt;  
&gt;- If CLG can play the early game as well as they did in the NA LCS. In the summer split, Doublelift AND Zion averaged the highest CSD@10 for their role (+10 for Zion, +5 for Doublelift). This is actually more impressive than it would seem. Normally during lane-swapping, a team trades a favorable matchup on one side of the map (top or bot) for a disadvantage in the other lane. CLG has consistently managed to get favorable matchups for top or bot, WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANYTHING. This will be increasingly harder to do against better competition, but if CLG can pull it off, they can win the group.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 2nd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By playing to the level they did during the NA playoffs, and by not being hurt by the player change in the jungle position.  
&gt;  
&gt;- If CLG avoids upsets at the hands of the Flash Wolves and paiN, they can shrug off potential defeats by the KOO Tigers. It will be important that the team remain strong after defeat and keep their heads clear (something that has plagued CLG pre-NA championship).  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 3rd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By getting beaten or neutralized in the laning phase by the rest of the group, and losing communication in the team-fight phase.  
&gt;  
&gt;- We\u2019ve all seen it before: CLG puts a high execution pressure on themselves during games by picking daring team compositions and mechanically   
&gt;complex champions. They often rely on their ability to outplay people in order to win. This might not work against the Flash Wolves or KOO, and CLG could fall to 3rd place.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 4th**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By suffering a total collapse.  
&gt;- We know that this is the best CLG has ever been, but we also know this is the strongest an IWC team has ever been in paiN gaming. If CLG allows the switch in jungle to get to their heads, as well as the pressure playing internationally, it may be possible for them to spiral out of control in groups. No team in this group is a push-over and every team will require a unique plan and calm mind in order to beat. If CLG reverts to their spring split playoff form, they will be in big trouble.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My prediction: 2nd. **  
&gt;  
&gt;- With everything considered, CLG is a very strong team. I also think the coaching infrastructure and mental coaching the team has given the players has allowed them to reach their True potentials. This team is also immensely hungry, and looking to prove themselves again and again. They should be heavily motivated from their triumph over TSM and carry their momentum towards the group stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;- I don\u2019t think it will be enough to take down the KOO tigers, but I still expect a strong showing from CLG in this group.  
&gt;- Realistically, 1st-3rd is all a possibility for CLG in this group, but my prediction is 2nd.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Flash Wolves**  
&gt;  
&gt;- Far and away the best team in the LMS for the spring split regular season, but then lost to AHQ in the playoffs and did not attend MSI.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Lost to HKE in summer playoffs, but beat HKE 3-2 in the regional qualifiers to make it here to worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;- 4/5ths of this line-up consists of the Gamania Bears from S3 worlds. (Winds no longer with the team, instead Karsa in the jungle)  
&gt;  
&gt;- This year saw large improvement for LMS teams since they were able to break away from the GPL and play in a more competitive league: this re-energized many old players to tryhard.  
&gt;  
&gt;- As far as struggles go, Flash Wolves were hit by the cinderhulk patch all the way back in spring and never truly recovered. In fact, when they qualified for worlds it was largely due to them defaulting back to their tried and True playstyle instead of playing meta-champions. This included playing Varus bot lane, and resulted in 3 wins across 4 games to take the regional qualifiers 3-2 against HKE.  
&gt;  
&gt;- LMS teams have also had the luxury all year long of being geographically capable of scrimming against LPL and LCK teams. This could prove invaluable as they match up against other regions at worlds.   
&gt;  
&gt;- During the regular season, NL actually sat on the bench for several games in favor of Korean ADC Kkramer. Kkramer was the starter during the defeat to HKE in the playoffs, but NL was the starter during the regional qualifier finals. I think this position could still be on flux, and will affect FW\u2019s performance heading into worlds.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Flash Wolves found much of their success through executing dives and team-fights without hesitation; however, that started to backfire as it became too clear to better teams what their intentions were and they could be countered accordingly.   
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 1st**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If their practice against LPL and LCK teams allowed them to grow, and if the LMS region is truly under-rated by most analysts.   
&gt;  
&gt;- If Maple is able to make assassins work and FW can play their kill-focused style of game.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Flash Wolves need to seriously over-perform to take down KOO and CLG in this group. With that being said, it is beneficial that they are in a group without an LPL team, as that region most closely mimics the style of FW, and is better at it. Flash wolves found most of their success with NL on Sivir and Steak on Mao/Hecarim. Additionally, Maple is a feared Zed player. If they can make their team-comps work, and not get heavily out-drafted while keeping their players on comfort champions, they can push the tempo on teams in this group and come out on top.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 2nd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If they play up to the level of their mechanics and teams don\u2019t heavily capitalize on how predictable they can be.  
&gt;  
&gt;- As mentioned earlier, Flash Wolves have a tendency to over-commit to dives, which can be punished hard. There is also a strong chance that teams spend the majority of their time studying for CLG and KOO, and don\u2019t pick up on Flash Wolves tendencies. If this happens, they can take the #2 spot in the group.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 3rd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If their weaknesses are exposed by the better teams in the group.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Steak has been less than stellar in the summer split and there are some formidable top laners in this group such as ZionSpartan and Smeb. If Steak lets opponent top laners get going (whether they are playing tanks or carries) it can throw a serious wrench into their star player Maple and his ability to carry with assassins.   
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 4th**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By playing over-aggressive.  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;- This team has had some failures in the past, including dominating the spring split only to be convincingly beaten by AHQ in the finals. If they lose the first few games and begin to lose confidence in each other, I can see this team losing games to all 3 other teams in this group. If they aren\u2019t picking meta champions, and over-aggress on their dives against teams built to capitalize on their mistakes, they could finish dead last in the group.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My prediction: 3rd**  
&gt;  
&gt;I had flash wolves as my 2nd weakest team in \u201cpool 2\u201d that I thought teams would want drawn into their group, so it\u2019s no surprise that I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll make it out of this group. With that being said, the LMS is probably the most unpredictable region in the world. AHQ\u2019s performance at MSI (defeating both FNC and TSM in groups) was a wake-up call to many that the LMS should not be taken for granted. Yet here I am, taking the LMS for granted and placing them as 3rd in my prediction. I think FW have the highest variance in this group, and I could realistically see them anywhere from 1st(quite unlikely) to 4th. I think they\u2019ll finish 3rd.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**KOO Tigers**  
&gt;  
&gt;KOO Tigers is fascinating to me. Typically they don\u2019t fit the bill of a Korean team with a rich and vibrant esports history. Instead, it\u2019s a new organization with a collection of misfits from the Korean Scene.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Smeb was considered one of the worst top laners in the LCK in 2014, but has been one of the best all throughout 2015 on KOO.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Hojin was a Najin Black Sword sub who had fairly low expectations heading into the year. Additionally he got chewed out for his poor performance at IEM Katowice, and soon after had trouble adapting to the cinderhulk tank meta.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Kuro has been around the competitive game in Korea since 2013, bouncing from IM#2, to NJBS, and now to KOO in 2015. He has struggled on Azir, going 0-6 in summer on him, and has otherwise been a generally reliable mid-laner who favors Viktor heavily over most other champions. His Yasuo at IEM Katowice was atrocious, and he has put in a ton of work to make it a power pick for the team at worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Pray, while he was great on Najin Black Sword for 2 years, was considered over the hill. However, when the LCK season started he put up impressive numbers and was one of the first carries to thrive in \u201cJuggermaw\u201d.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Gorilla was probably the \u2018best\u2019 player when KOO tigers formed, and many believe that the team was built around Gorilla. Gorilla was a dominant Janna player at worlds in 2014, and has been a big part in the KOO tigers macro play throughout the year.   
&gt;  
&gt;As Far as playstyle is concerned, KOO plays a heavily macro focused game. Most of their lanes look to play reliably and then they try to pull their advantages out in the late game through better map movements and superior team fighting. Often times because they don\u2019t look impressive when they beat people, they are perceived as weak, but let\u2019s not forget this is the #2 seed from the LCK, and has been around the top teams in Korea the entire year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 1st**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If they are able to adapt to the worlds 5.18 patch and keep up their macro focused style of play.   
&gt;  
&gt;- When the KOO tigers stormed onto the scene in the spring split, they were actually innovators. Kuro was one of the first major Viktor players in the LCK, and even won a game as mid lane Sion.  KOO doesn\u2019t necessarily have a problem playing a diverse set of champions, but they do look to have a problem in changing their champions QUICKLY. If KOO can use the 1 month break from the end of their LCK season and the start of worlds to perfect the right set of champions for worlds, their macro play and experience can carry them to first in the group.   
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 2nd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If they fail to find their comfort zone in champion select, but maintain composure and play their style.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Even if KOO isn\u2019t able to play the best champions in the meta (as was seen with Kuro\u2019s poor Azir play in summer) they are still capable of beating most teams. They narrowly lost out to KT Rolster in summer playoffs 3-2.  Korea plays the best macro focused league of legends in the world, and even if KOO isn\u2019t completely at the top of the game I still think they get 2nd in the group.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 3rd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- If IEM ghosts of past return for worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Let\u2019s not forget, KOO (then the GE Tigers) went to IEM Katowice as the #1 team in Korea. They then proceeded to lose to team WE, a near bottom of the pack LPL team. It was honestly one of the biggest upsets in League of Legends history, and it took KOO a long time to recover from the defeat.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Against team WE, Koo\u2019s slow style of early game was mercilessly punished. They fell behind in a big way early game (something CLG and FW are capable of doing to KOO as well) and could never recover enough to get to their strong team-fighting phase. If KOO starts slow out of the gate, they could get rushed down by CLG and FW and fail to advance from groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 4th**  
&gt;  
&gt;- I don\u2019t think this is a reasonable scenario.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Even though the Talent drop-off in Korea has been evident this year, (With everyone far, far behind SKT) I think no matter what, the experience and talent of the KOO lineup can avoid finishing in 4th place here.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My prediction: 1st**  
&gt;  
&gt;- I have a lot of faith in KOO\u2019s ability to prepare and find the right champions for the 5.18 patch.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Hojin (formerly Lee) should also be very happy about the patch. +5AD on warrior enchant and small buffs to Lee sin and J4, his best champions from this year.   
&gt;  
&gt;- Additionally there is going to be a large top-lane focus at worlds, and Smeb has shown time and time again that he is a massive force to be reckoned with.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Add that to the fact that this team has been able to execute on their precise win-conditions of their team comps again and again, I see them coming out as 1st on this group.   
&gt;  
&gt;**paiN**  
&gt;  
&gt;Let\u2019s talk about paiN. This team has been trying to make it to worlds since the IWC tournament that was held at Gamescon in 2013, where they finished 2nd. From that 2013 Squad, they still field Kami (their star mid laner),  brTT (their vocal and famous ADC), and sirT (their shotcalling jungler).   
&gt;  
&gt;This has also been paiN\u2019s best year. Despite finishing 3rd place in the split 1 playoffs (called summer playoffs, but for consistency sake will be called split 1... because southern hemisphere)  paiN were able to win the split 2 playoffs in 3-0 fashion, and then also 3-0 a KLG team at the IWC to qualify for worlds.   
&gt;  
&gt;As I stated before during the worlds group draw show, this is the strongest IWC team to ever attend a World Championship. What\u2019s interesting about this team is every member of the roster has been around a good while.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Mylon has been playing competitively since the creation of the BR servers. He won the season 2 Brazilian championship, and has bounced around a good bit from Keyd Stars (where he played with 2 Koreans) to paiN this year when they were having issues finding a quality top laner. He is a strong shotcaller, and has long been known as a good player but never the \u2018best\u2019 player.   
&gt;  
&gt;- SirT has been with paiN since 2012, and has long been known as the best jungler in the scene. This year it was debate-able whether Revolta (INTZ jungler) was the best, but ultimately SirT is the one going to worlds for Brazil. SirT is a reactive/support type jungler, and focuses on warding/ganking instead of trying to carry himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Kami. Kami is hype. He\u2019s been the best player in Brazil for years, consistently sitting atop the solo Q ladder and doing work in the competitive scene as well. He usually holds multiple accounts in the top 10, and even has a \u201cLux only\u201d account in challenger. While Kami is known on many champions, he seems to excel most on traditional mages rather than assassins, with some dominating performances on Orianna.  
&gt;  
&gt;- brTT was a former 1.6 pro in Brazil, has the largest fan base of any esports personality, and also has a giant tattoo of Kayle on his back. In the past, brTT has a mindset of always needing to be the primary carry, and would clash with team members (specifically in 2014 on keyd stars, where they failed to qualify) But this year has taken a more suitable role within the team. Carrying when necessary, doing whatever it takes to win.  
&gt;  
&gt;- Dioud came over to the team from Europe. It\u2019s interesting that a region who imported multiple Koreans back in 2014, ends up making it to worlds with an imported European as the support. Dioud has been able to adapt fully to the team style, and has legal status in the country as a \u201cPro Esport Player\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;With all that being said, this is still a Wild-card team, who rarely if ever gets to play against top teams from around the world. INTZ held a boot camp in North America before the CBLoL finals, and reported to do well against top NA teams, but that is hardly enough data to go off of to call paiN a powerhouse for defeating INTZ.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 1st**  
&gt;  
&gt;- It\u2019s a long-shot, but I actually think this is possible. It would require an IEM level meltdown from KOO, CLG reverting to spring split form, and FW failing to adapt to the worlds patch. If all of those things happen, and paiN plays well, they can beat every single one of those teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 2nd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- When paiN has time to prepare, they typically perform well. Additionally, since their whole team has been playing competitively for so long, they can execute on many different playstyles and metas.   
&gt;  
&gt;- This would still require one of the two favorites in the group (KOO or CLG) to collapse, as well as for paiN to play to the peak of their ability.   
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;**How they finish 3rd**  
&gt;  
&gt;- By playing too slowly and getting over-run by better strategic teams, or teams that play faster than them  
&gt;  
&gt;- Despite paiN\u2019s success in the CBLoL playoffs and IWC, they showed a poor ability to push the pace of a game, as well as initiate cleanly and often. This type of thing is highly punishable by elite teams, and if paiN cannot improve the way they create fights and opportunity, they will finish poorly.   
&gt;  
&gt;**How they finish 4th**  
&gt;  
&gt;- Because no other wild-card team has ever done better than last.   
&gt;  
&gt;- The challenges that a Wild-Card region face are immense, and historically it hasn\u2019t even been close. Kabum won a game, which was huge, but that was just a single game in a 1-5 group stage.   
&gt;  
&gt;- The likely outcome for these guys is unfortunately 4th place, based on history, pressure of the stage, and past opponents.  
&gt;  
&gt;**My prediction: 4th**  
&gt;  
&gt;- Even though I see a long-shot chance that paiN make it out of groups, I think odds are they finish 4th here.  paiN and the Brazilian region in general have come a long way to match the level of league of legends played in main regions. However, their typically slow style of play that often lacks strong initiation makes it even harder to defeat superior teams. I don\u2019t think this will be a Dark Passage level of 0-6 in the groups however, like we saw in the 2014 World Championships. I think paiN brings a lot of positives to the table, and will probably land with a 1-5 or 2-4 record in groups, picking up wins as opponents falter.   
&gt;  
&gt;This was long\u2026 Who do you think will win Group A?

 **An Old Short Story**

&gt;Another Day on the Rift  
&gt;  
&gt;It was another crisp morning on the rift, I picked up my gear and headed on out. Just as I entered the cold dark of the jungle I felt a warm breeze making me feel light on my feet. I turned as I followed the blind monk and there she was, I smiled and she laughed, \u201cThe Tempest is at your command!\u201d I knew we\u2019d make a good team on the southern front.  
&gt;An immense hiss erupted from the jungle as a massive lizard burst out of the trees with two hatchlings up to my knees; you can imagine how big the father was. I shot 3 bullets and left the monk to deal with it, he knew what he was doing. I followed the women out of the jungle who seemed to float with such grace and speed.    
&gt;We joined up with the troops and met the enemy halfway on the southern side of the rift. We caught sight of the enemy but no champions to command them, they must have took a wrong turn in the jungle. The troops clashed and we stayed back shooting as much as we could before there reinforcements arrived, and boy did they arrive.  I could hear her laughing insanely before she even stepped out of the brush.  She had bright blue hair and carrying 2 guns but not like mine; she carried a massive rocket launcher and chain gun.  She was followed out by him. I saw his dark twisted face and heard the clinking of that damned lantern and all I could think about was\u2026 Well, how I missed using only one gun. I had to win this, it was personal.  
&gt;I shot an enemy caster right in the head and I felt an energy flow through me, the blonde women fighting with me winked at me and surrounded me with an orb of pure air it was amazing. I dashed forward making sure he couldn\u2019t hook me with his chain, I shot the crazy girl twice and pierced her with a bolt of light and another two bullets in quick succession. She was running, they couldn't handle us right now since we arrived to the battle first and knew a bit more than they did. Nevertheless, that green demon came charging at me and flayed his chains at me, knocking me back. I couldn\u2019t fight him he had his troops around him so I made a tactical retreat. Unfortunately she applied some of that red tonic and the bullet wounds I was so proud of seemed to fade back to pale white skin. \u201cNot to worry though I done it once I can do it again no problem,\u201d or so I thought.  
&gt;She was losing concentration it seemed, walking too close to me and letting me get the odd shot off at her. I called for the orb of wind to deflect a few bullets as I noticed her get too close again. Bang! I pierced her with a bolt of light and fired my ardent blaze at her so I can chase her down; If only it was that easy. She didn\u2019t run. She zapped me with her side arm and it shocked me, I could barely walk then she threw what looked like laughing bear traps at my feet. I got caught in one but could still fight. That\u2019s when it dawned on me, \u201cI\u2019m being ganked! She would never try to fight me when I\u2019m this strong.\u201d Before I knew it the sky seemed to close over like someone threw a veil over the sun and a thick darkness descended. I could only see 2 feet in front of myself when I broke free of those traps. I ran for my tower and out of the darkness some form of black ghost came crashing into me at a tremendous speed. I was scared for my life until the darkness lifted and I felt that warm wind again. The blonde women spotted me and knew I\u2019d have been a goner if she didn\u2019t help. She cast a spell and in the blink of an eye she was by my side. Her hair flew into the air as she called upon a mighty monsoon that blew all 3 of the enemies away but at the same time seemed to fill me with warmth that made me feel strong enough to fight again. They continued to chase us but as I ran back I saw an old buddy of mine come bursting out of the jungle. He threw a ward totem behind them and leaped onto it, \u201cwhat are you doing we are separated now?\u201d I thought to myself. He made a colossal sound and smashed the pale girl with a sonic boom; he had his sights set on her. With an almighty kick like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen, he sent her flying towards us, crashing directly into our tower it cannoned a massive bullet on her as he came soaring in after with a lethal kick that sent her to the abyss. We chased the other two all the way up the south side but they managed to get away. We managed to destroy their outer turret so we headed back to base to rest and get supplies for the big battle.   
&gt;It was there I met our other two team mates. One was what I can only describe as a gargantuan rock creature and the other an eccentric little Yordle that seemed to have one to many swigs of that crystalline flask he was refilling. The rock didn\u2019t speak much, though I could see loneliness in his eyes that snapped into a look of sheer fortitude and determination as he stepped off the platform. The Yordle however, he kept yapping on about how he was a Dean of Demolitions and how if we ever needed anything blown up, he was the man for the job. All the while he was rolling and throwing bombs about recklessly enough for me to want to get a move on, also we heard news from the front line the enemy was gathering in the centre of the rift for one last battle.   
&gt;This was it. Whoever won this battle would have the opponent's nexus for sure. We took position in the centre of the rift doing a dance we had all done a thousand times but somehow, someone always misses a step and getting their toe stepped on.  The two enemies I hadn\u2019t encountered yet were alongside their team. I heard about this guy, The Hand of Noxus they called him, a True warrior, blood dripping from his axe and those stone cold eyes staring at me, I knew I\u2019d have to stay away from him or it was over. In the back prowled a beautiful woman. As she came closer it seemed not to be a woman at all. She had nine tails and pointed ears like a dog or a fox. She looked quick but I trusted my team would keep her from me long enough so I could do my job.   
&gt;Both sides sized each other up for a long time I could tell the Yordle was getting impatient constantly lobbing bombs and mines at them. Yet still, the rock paced stoically. Patiently he scanned the enemy team.  He seemed to know what he was doing we\u2019d go on his lead and I was strong enough now, thirsty for blood.  
&gt;The back and forth of bullets and spells was constant. The fox stepped forward to cast a spell at the Yordle but the little fur-ball rolled to the side and flung a satchel charge right at her feet it knocked her back towards us and all hell broke loose. A swirling tornado flew from behind me and knocked the fox into the air, bombs rained down on her and I stepped in to finish her off. \u201cOh no!\u201d is all I can remember thinking as I felt the cold chain of that monster rap around my body from over the wall. The green monster pulled the chain so hard he came hurtling towards me. I see the sky go black again and that ghost come crashing into me, I wasn\u2019t scared this time! I spied the Yordle and the rock chasing down the fox who was rushing away for her life as the Hand of Noxus tried to save her but one long throw and a few bounces of a bomb finished her and the giant warrior protecting her fled for the brush. I saw the blue haired girl come rushing at me as I scream for help! The rock turned and without a moment\u2019s hesitation came soaring towards them with an unbelievable, unstoppable force that sent all 3 of them airborne. I turned and started to lay down fire with my support. I pierce the ghost as it falls to the ground like an old rag in the wind. The monk came darting out again with frightening speed and leaps onto the blue haired girl with a crippling punch she falls to the ground but as she does, a massive axe sweeps from the bush and pulls in the monk! He spins and slices right through him and the monk falls to his knees as The Hand of Noxus leaps and comes down in a thunderous rage and obliterates him. I can see rage in his eyes; he wants more and stretches out to pull me. Meanwhile, the biggest rocket I have ever seen came flying at me accompanied by the sound of manic laughter. Within a split second I dash past them both as it wizzes by me I remember how the monk saved me earlier. With all my might I rained 25 bullets straight into the chest plate of that axe wielding maniac; He drops and we push for the win. They only had two towers left and I\u2019ll be damned if I let that green monster stay safe under them! The Yordle threw a massive bomb and as the resulting inferno subsided the girl lay on the floor; the laughing had finally stopped. The thing that makes me wield both those guns was the only thing standing in my way, I needed to catch him. I dash after him and their turret bombards me, it\u2019s agony but nowhere near as much as pain he has caused me! He knows he can\u2019t run, he tries to hook me and I dance around it and purify him. It was the last whisper he ever heard as he fell I knew the enemy tower would answer but I had done enough.  
&gt; \u201cFor Senna.\u201d

 **Some Helpful Tips/Tricks for Lower Elos that you might not think about.**

&gt;Hey guys/gals,  
&gt;  
&gt;So long story short, I've gone on a megaslide from Gold 1/plat 5 elo all the way down to gold 5 and pretty much middle silver elo.   
&gt;  
&gt;But that is not my point of discussion; What I've seen now that I am down this low has sort of blown my mind. It's okay, though!   
&gt;  
&gt;{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}   
&gt;  
&gt;I am obviously no soloq god or anything, but I am going to throw out some things that I have seen that are major causes of games to be lost in lower rankings. Because once in Silver, most of us have our own person mechanics down and can handle ourselves. We need to transition that into the rest of the map and team to turn it into more likely wins.   
&gt;  
&gt;First major thing, the all powerful ward: {{item:2043}} *cue heaven music*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vision is a HUGE issue between Low silver and High Gold, I've seen.** But instead of boring you with the amount of words I am already using, I made up some wood level diagrams to help explain me points.  Red circles are where you want vision when on red side, so blue, obviously when you are on blue side and then pinks can be for either team.  I will have the graphic BELOW the description.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Early game vision:** Now, I know you need some wards on your side of the map also, but I am making this graphic as if you were holding in the middle of your lane and where you would want forward vision to keep an eye out for ganks from other lanes or the jungle AND keep early objective control.   
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/56shqdF.png  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mid to Late game vision:** As you start pushing forward down the lanes, the wards need to go forward with you. A lot of games have been thrown because a team gets an early lead, shoves down too hard without vision and give up shut down gold and free farm to the enemy for nothing. You always want to know where the enemy is (or isn't, then you can make a good guess where they are.)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/Ml0GAT8.png  
&gt;  
&gt;**Split Pushers! :** Split pushing can be an amazing way to bring a game back from the brink of losing or seal the deal on a game that you already have a lead with... BUT it is only effective if you and your team knows where the enemy is, who is going to stop the split and how many. You can then make smarter and faster calls with that information and also the split pusher doesn't die with the rest of the tem in a position where they can't get anything for it  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/hI95mPS.png  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tower Sieges:** 5 man sieges when you are ahead are probably the easiest way to en a game IF you have the correct comp to do it with. We're speaking in generals though. The only issue is, like late game warding. If you're in the lead, shoving a tower together and the enemy gets the upper hand and wins a big fight, you just tossed a LOT of gold to them for nothing and they might make a comeback or make plays off of it. Always keep vision on your sides to prevent ganks/flanks. My graphic for this one is a very simple siege on 2nd tier mid tower from the blue side's view. (It's also for ants, I am sorry.)  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/txV3OQ6.png  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dragon Control:** Dragon is a vital part of the game now, it let's you snowball leads or gain ground on your enemy and even the playing field again for your awesome comeback. Vision is a great way to control it, first the enemy has a hard time getting in if you're already there, or you know what path is best to come in and prevent them from taking it. You can usually win a fight AND take the drake for even more gold and bonuses ({{champion:41}}  approves Gold and small areas)  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/Q9I2SSI.png  
&gt;  
&gt;**Baron Control:** It's the NA server's favorite time of the game... _THE THROW AT BARNO!_ ..... but actually, let's find ways to NOT throw with it and instead do what it is supposed to do. (This vision control can be used for Rift Herald also) The major points of this vision control is once again of course to deny entry to the enemy, but also, if you should attempt a baron in a 5v5 where they will fight for it. You need to see the enemy jungler an also make sure they are not setting you up to be trapped in baron pit taking all that damage, losing the fight.  
&gt;  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/UjRppdE.png  
&gt;  
&gt;{{summoner:3}} *takes a deep breath* That was a LOT for you to do, and obviously it's not magically that easy. But starting to throw out a ward here and there in key spots will certainly help turn some fights an might win you an extra game out of 3, and that's all you need for promos!  
&gt;  
&gt;I really, really, really do care about players learning the game. I've been watching professional level games since season 1 and love the game knowledge aspect of it all. (If only my mechanics were better I could actually get somewhere, qq)   
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this helps you guys!  
&gt;  
&gt;Good luck,  
&gt;88M

 **Incoming: Some Introductions!**

&gt;Hi gang,  
&gt;  
&gt;As we're getting to figure out dev corner content for 2016, we thought it would also be good to get some of our more prominent designers and design leads introduced so you can get a feel for what we're working on and who's focused on what. We're doing this to set the foundation for a series of personal **dev blogs** on evergreen topics like our balance philosophy, champion design, systems interactions, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the course of the next few weeks, you'll hear from some of the team with a rundown of their interests, past work, and what they'll want to write about next year. They'll also stick around for a bit during the day to field questions or source any topic inspiration from you!   
&gt;  
&gt;So if you really want to hear more about designing Cinderhulk from our lead systems designer, or what went into the recent batch of marksmen updates, hang out!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'll try to keep you updated every **Monday** on the upcoming schedule of designer introductions. All in all, before the holidays kick in, you should at least hear from:  
&gt;  
&gt;* Greg **'Riot Ghostcrawler'** Street - Design Director, League of Legends  
&gt;* Andrei **'Meddler'** Van Roon - Lead Designer, League of Legends

 **BS.**

&gt;Hello. I made a ticket about a problem im having with the gifting feature in pbe. It took you riot 4-6 days to just tell me there is no gifting feature in pbe? Ive been gifting others for a while, and others have been gifting me too. I am 100% sure there is a gifting feature in pbe. I am pretty annoyed the fact that riot took this long to just tell me there is no gifting feature in pbe. After I sent screenshots of my friend gifting me they didnt reply , and the day after gifting center is disabled? what the hell? Really riot? Photos of the conversation are in the link.  
&gt;  
&gt;My original problem "Helloo, today I got a pbe account. I played a game with my friends. I noticed that in the gifting center I cant gift no one? Its not restricting me but It says i have no one available to gift- its blank no ones on my friend list, but I added 2 of my friends? Its the same thing for my friends, they don't see my name in the gifting option. Help please and thanks :)

 **Kayle rework idea**

&gt;I was thinking what if we rework  her compleetly. A compleet new concept, a compleet new playstyle:  
&gt;  
&gt;* **Role:** Fighter/Mage  
&gt;  
&gt;This change would shift her more into a squishy frontline. Been able to block incoming damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;----  
&gt;  
&gt;The suggestion:  
&gt;  
&gt;* #P - Divine Blessing  
&gt; * **PASSIVE:** After 3 auto attacks Kayle blesses herself, healing her and granting her bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.  
&gt;* #Q - Reckoning  
&gt; * Unchanged  
&gt;* #W - Intervention  
&gt; * **ACTIVE:** Kayle closes her wings and forms it as a shield in the target direction while also dashing in the opposite direction, creating a barrier that intercepts incoming enemy projectiles and blocks all damage she takes through the shield. During this time Kayle cannot attack during the activation and the shield doesn't block True damage.  
&gt;   * **DURATION:** 1.5  
&gt;* #E - Righteous Fury  
&gt; * Unchanged  
&gt;* #R - Holy Fervor  
&gt; * **ACTIVE:** For the next 10 seconds Kayle's basic attacks and Reckoning reduce the armor and magic resistance of affected enemy champions by 8% for 5 seconds, stacking up to 5 times for a maximum of 40%.   
&gt;  
&gt;---  
&gt;  
&gt;#Why?  
&gt;  
&gt;Kayle current design is build arround to be a supportive champions that grant utility. When in really she always performed as a solo carry. Her ult is really nice for her supportive role but honnestly it didn't fit her playstyle. People just loved to crush teamfights with her. And honnestly it just fits her kit better. With most new champions providing so much utility if rework would ever release Kayle right now. I'm pretty sure they would do something similar with her. With this rework she still provides a lot off utility to the rift but her solo playstyle is more defined now.  
&gt;  
&gt;http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=10552364  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Thoughts?

&gt;Pretty happy so far, though our expectations weren't that things would be perfect from the start. Our goals were to make masteries that were noticeable in game, that modified how you and other players played to a moderate amount and that had some meaningful choice to them. We feel we're hitting the first two goals fairly well. Choice is present in some cases, though some Masteries do feel mandatory or pointless for some champions.   
&gt;  
&gt;One of the next things we'll be doing is gradually fleshing out the Tier 1 and Tier 2 keystones to 3 choices each. Intent there is to offer options for champions that aren't drawn to some trees at present to offer more choice between trees while also offering choices between masteries at a tier for those already using them. We also want to help out some classes that aren't currently being well enough served (assassins in particular). Additionally there's still a fair bit of balance tuning needed on some of the existing masteries, where there are potentially interesting choices to be made once the numbers are refined into the right spots.    
&gt;  
&gt;The 5 point stat masteries by contrast aren't intended to be choices generally. Stats are much, much easier to optimize, but do need to be provided to give champions appropriate functionality and define how attractive each tree is to any given champion. We're fine with those often feeling predetermined at some tiers as a result, with some options on certain champions depending on how you want to play.

 **If mouse is moving too quick and I try to ping, it will just jump in a random direction (video)**

&gt;Hi there,  
&gt;  
&gt;It's pretty old (for me) for the last 2 months (at least), I just figured out that I have to move my mouse a little more slowly and it was no problem, but after this very last patch it's worse, it's almost unusable.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, the thing is:  
&gt;-&gt; Move your mouse in one direction fast and hit the ALT key or V key (I usually use the ALT one) while moving.  
&gt;Release it in the middle of the movement, something like move -&gt; key in -&gt; key out -&gt; stop.   
&gt;For me, the cursor will just randomly pop-up in another location (as in video).  
&gt;  
&gt;Tried with a random OEM mouse, but I use a SteelSeries Sensei at 1600 dpi, 1ms.  
&gt;  
&gt;PC Specs:  
&gt;Phenom 545 (3.3 ghz, dual)  
&gt;8 GB ddr3  
&gt;Radeon r7 260x  
&gt;120gb ssd  
&gt;750gb hdd.

 **[FOLLOWUP] Tahm Kench**

&gt;Following on from the [Mordekaiser Update Follow-Up](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3YnLEYkK-followup-mordekaiser-update), here's our internal design review for Tahm Kench. Please see Statikk's post on Mordekaiser for more context on what these design reviews are.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'll paste the actual review in this first post, but I'll also have a much more in-depth and verbose explainer posted as the first comment on this thread. I hope you like words, cause I got a lot of em.   
&gt;  
&gt;I will leave this thread open until Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Original Goals:**  
&gt;  
&gt;* Make a tank who is not defined by AOE CC or single target pickoff  
&gt;* Offer a powerful and cool support function through ally devour  
&gt;* Enable strategic map mobility for two people  
&gt;* Can be played in multiple positions: both solo and support  
&gt;  
&gt;**What's working: **  
&gt;  
&gt;* Ally devour is a big, cool moment for Tahm and his team  
&gt;* Tahm is picked frequently as a support, mostly for devour  
&gt;* Tahm is played successfully in top, support, and jungle  
&gt;  
&gt;**Problems:**  
&gt;  
&gt;* High level of frustration playing against:  
&gt;* MS away from enemy means ally devour is never the wrong move  
&gt;* Tough skin means killing Tahm feels like not an option either  
&gt;* Ult is mostly used solo, particularly outside of competitive play  
&gt;* High damage output means Tahm often chases down and kills people where it feels inappropriate for a support to do so  
&gt;   
&gt;**Possible next steps:**  
&gt;  
&gt;* Ally W no longer has MS away from enemy (going live in 5.24)  
&gt;* Encourage cooperative use of R: minimum wait time but quicker arrival  
&gt;* Reassess E tankiness: reduce shield duration and/or grey health duration  
&gt;* Investigate why some champions cannot opt out of fighting Tahm (more on this below)

 **Not sure how this would work, but I have a fun idea for a project!**

&gt;I've been involved in amateur voice acting for almost three years. I'm very passionate about it, and I recently thought of something that would be hella fun to work on for myself and other aspiring voice actors.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, one of my life goals is to voice a character in a video game, and I'm sure others share this aspiration. Wouldn't it be cool if someone put together a voice pack-- a different UNPROFESSIONAL voice actor (but you know, decent mic and stuff) for each champion -- and made it available for download so you could hear it in game? I know there's different voice packs for things like TF2 that are fan-made, and I think it'd be really interesting to hear other people's interpretations of our beloved league champions. So what do you think? Would it be something you guys would be interested in?

&gt;Just so nobody has any new expectations that will get crushed: Dragon Master Swain is not slotted for production at any point in 2016 currently. There was a glimmer of hope for the skin in 2015 when I posted that, but it wasn't able to happen.

 **The Vow of Sion. [Story]**

&gt;So a thread about a predeath {{champion:14}} skin got me thinking him.  I've been playing him a lot (love the resolve tree) and decided to give my creative muscles a stretch by making a little fanfic of his final moments.  I don't normally write fanfiction and I haven't written anything creative for a few months (I started this project before Turkey Day in the USA, so I'm a lot slower than I like), but I kinda like how I've done this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spoiler: Alternative character interpretation.    
&gt;  
&gt;_The Vow of Sion._  
&gt;  
&gt;         \u201cSo you\u2019re going? \u201dSaid the woman under the covers,  
&gt;  
&gt;          \u201cHow else am I to remind Boram that he is a Noxian?\u201d the bed creaked with Sion\u2019s rise, the wooden planks creaked under his weight while he put on his armor.  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cBeing easier to find would be a start.  Though he probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate a scandal such as this.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cI\u2019m almost tempted to tell him, just to see his reaction.\u201d he said cheerfully, \u201cBut the less he knows, the better.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cAre you ashamed of me?\u201d she sat up from her bedsheets, revealing her rounded stomach.  Sion stopped donning his armor, \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cThe Mighty Sion, hand of Noxus!  Nightmare of Demacia.  And a bringer of bastards to Noxian har-\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cStop.\u201d he enjoyed her theatrics, but not when aimed at her.  \u201cThis child\u2026\u201d he placed his palm against her pregnant belly, \u201cIs no bastard.  I have sworn it.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWhat will others say?\u201d she grinned, \u201cGossip runs through the streets like a river.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cAs will the blood of those who dare impede us.\u201d Their lips met briefly before he returned to his equipment, \u201cBut I cannot defend from what I do not know.  With secrets come hidden foes, and Boram has a lot of secrets.  There is no telling how much his conspirators know from what he knows.\u201d He sighed in frustration, that\u2019s all politics was to him.  Mountains of frustration, lies, and complications.  Boram described it as another war, one that will hound him forever.  Sion disagreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cSo the less Boram knows about me, the safer I am?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	Sion nodded, \u201cAnd people see me as a mindless brute.\u201d he snickered, \u201cThey believe a warrior only survives by the strength of his arm.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cSo rather than stone walls and armed guards, I have a leaky roof and a decrepit old crone for protection?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	He raised a finger to comment, but his answer alluded him.  She laughed, \u201cBetter than nothing I suppose.\u201d with one last embrace she said, \u201cPromise me you will return.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	As gentle as he could, Sion wrapped his arms around her waist, her soft stomach rubbing against his gut as he drew her in closer, \u201cI swear on my soul that I will come back for you.  Go back to sleep, we\u2019ll be done shortly.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	As his love returned to her slumber, Sion took a quill and paper.  There was something he needed to say, something that despite best efforts he couldn\u2019t voice.    
&gt;  
&gt;***  
&gt;	Boram Darkwill lazily swirled the wine in his goblet, it was all he could do to ignore the complaints of silver tongued bureaucrats.  Over and over they panicked, restating the obvious as if it could change the outcome.  The True burden of a rulership was having to appease those who follow you.  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cHave you reached a decision, Grand General?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cHmm?  Oh yes.\u201d Despite his composed tone, Boram was frustrated at what he couldn\u2019t do.  Demacia on the doorstep of Noxus, with Jarvan at the helm?  How could this have happened?  He had underestimated his enemy, and despite his overwhelming desire to turn the tides, he had neither the manpower nor the support to do so.  None of these noble blooded cowards were willing to take risks, preferring to stall for time.  What madness was this that his own home prevented him from protecting it?    
&gt;  
&gt;	A muffled shout echoed in the distance, followed by thunderous footsteps.  Each echoed like the thunder of a storm.  Boram\u2019s black hounds raised their heads, ears perked up.  Boram smiled.    
&gt;  
&gt;	One of the hinges broke as the entrance doors were slammed open, \u201cBoram!\u201d Sion roared, his face bearing an expression of disgust and rage.  Already prepared for battle, with his massive axe in hand, he stomped into the room.  Some nobles and guards stepped backwards despite their safe distance, a noticeable effect of Sion\u2019s presence from time to time.  The black hounds wagged their tails.    
&gt;  
&gt;	Finally a noble spoke out, \u201cSion.  So glad you could join u-\u201d   
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWhy are you here, Boram.\u201d  Sion pointed his axe towards the Grand General, \u201cExplain why you\u2019re sitting comfortably on your throne and drinking wine as Demacia assaults our borders!\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cCan you not see we are strategizing?\u201d The Noble that Sion ignored pointed to the war table, covered in maps and models.  \u201cThis is the war room.  Where els-AHH!\u201d The noble leaped to the side as Sion\u2019s axe came down, cleaving the table in two.  Models, papers, and mapping tools clattered against the marble floor.    
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cNeed I remind you of your responsibilities, Boram?\u201d Sion picked up one of the model soldiers, \u201cYou are the leader of Noxus.  You are who the people must look to when our nation calls.\u201d Sion walked up to Boram, holding the figure in his fist, \u201cSo why is it, that when Jarvan stands upon our doorstep, you stay inside\u2026\u201d the toy shattered in his tightened fist, \u201cPlaying with toys.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	The echo of the broken miniature was the only noise that filled the room as it tumbled down the stairs.  Then only the muffled panic outside and the tense breaths of the heads of Noxus crowded the room.  Sion towered over Boram, awaiting response.   
&gt;  
&gt;	The chalice made a soft metallic \u201ctink\u201d as Boram placed it upon his armrest, \u201cAnd what\u2026\u201d he tented his fingers and crossed his legs as he looked up to Sion, \u201cDo you suggest we do?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cKill Jarvan.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	A few noblemen chuckled from behind, only to cease at Sion\u2019s glare.  Boram remained stoic, \u201cNo assassin can bypass his royal guard.  Even my sanity has been questioned with repeated attempts.\u201d he explained, his eyes never wavered from Sion\u2019s stare.  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWhen did I suggest assassins?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWell we cannot just run up to him and cleave his head from his shoulders.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWhy not?\u201d Sion grinned, Boram could see the excitement in his eyes.  His friend was never one for details.  
&gt;  
&gt;	Boram chuckled, \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought this through.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cYou\u2019ve thought too much.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cWe cannot just charge straight into their army and expect to win!\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cKill Jarvan and Demacia will fall.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cI know that!  But this is not the time for that!  We are boxed in, hopelessly outnumbered, and ill prepared!\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cLike a rat, shoved helplessly into a corner as the cat readies to pounce.  Tell me Boram, what does a rat do when cornered?\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Boram braced his head, \u201cLashes out.  Like any desperate animal.\u201d    
&gt;  
&gt;	Sion nodded, \u201cSometimes he wins.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cBarely.  We\u2019ll die if we attack.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cAnd we\u2019ll assure ourselves a slow death if we lock the gates.  This battle is happening Boram, and the odds are not in our favor.  How do you wished to be remembered?  Dying in your city like a coward,\u201d Sion brought himself down on one knee and bowed his head, \u201cOr defiant to the end, like a True Noxian.\u201d  
&gt;  
&gt;	Lord Darkwill grabbed his drink, staring into its contents as he swished it around.  This situation was all wrong, it should be reversed.  He should be leading an attack on Demacia, with that damnable Jarvan cowering in his...    
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cTell our forces to stand ready at the gates.\u201d   
&gt;  
&gt;	Boram was in no hurry to die.  But he\u2019ll be damned if history remembers him as a coward.  If he was to die, then he shall die gloriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;***  
&gt;  
&gt;	_Dearest beloved,_  
&gt;  
&gt;	_You once asked me if there was anything I loved more than war.  I still stand by my answer, but I will not deny that it is only by a small margin._  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cOpen the gates!\u201d Sion screamed as he hoisted his axe high above his head.  Cheers from soldiers and citizens alike echoed from behind, Noxus would not die quietly.    
&gt;  
&gt;	_I\u2019m sure I could find the words to describe the joy I feel on the battlefield.  The screams of the enemy, the feeling of crushing bones under my boots, the resistance of my axe as it cleaves a man in two.  But our time together should tell you that I am not one for words._  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cCharge!\u201d Axe in one hand and reigns in the other, Sion\u2019s steed galloped forward on his command.  Leading the onslaught, they rushed through the gate and into the frontlines of Demacia\u2019s infantry.  Their alarmed screams were followed by the sound of gored flesh, clanging metal, and gasps of ending life.  Notes in his symphony of war.  
&gt;  
&gt;	_Yet my bloodlust can no longer satisfy me.  Ever since I met you, I have felt...assured.  I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but I feel satisfied when I am with you.  I can sleep peacefully knowing that you are in my arms._  
&gt;  
&gt;	Arrows punctured through the neck of his horse.  It squealed with its last breath, toppling forward with the full force of its charge.  Sion kicked himself off to avoid being crushed, instinctively rolling as he landed.  His men charged ahead of him, but the Demacian soldiers were steadfast in their position.  None passed through.  
&gt;  
&gt;     _But I cannot ignore the call of battle._	  
&gt;  
&gt;        He could see it, the crown of Jarvan off in the distance.  Riding atop his white horse, Sion swore that a smug grin sat across the king\u2019s lips.  His heart ticked quickly in fury, returning his attention to the dead horse.  Its job was not over.  
&gt;  
... continued on next comment ...
&gt;      _Until recently, this didn\u2019t concern me.  But now...now I understand why cowards flee._  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cJarvan!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Sion bellowed as he threw the lifeless stead across the battlefield.  The Demacian screams were lost on him as he charged through their broken front line.  The swings of his axe decimated countless defenders, their swords and spears did nothing to impede the juggernaut.    
&gt;  
&gt;	_I\u2019m afraid.  I\u2019ve been afraid ever since you told me you were with child.  Everything around me felt as though it...I don\u2019t know how to describe it.  Bigger?  More intimidating?  I couldn\u2019t  understand why I was suddenly so afraid.  Then I looked in a mirror.  Can I truly be a good father?_  
&gt;  
&gt;	Laughter mixed in with the death throes of the enemy.  The very thought that these weaklings could back Noxus into a corner...it was too much to bare.  His axe swings suddenly become more difficult, the sound of his blade cleaving into flesh had vanished.  After ten more dead soldiers, he realized that the axe blade had fallen off.  Sion proceeded to use the handle as a club as he pushed forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;	_I\u2019m no fool.  I know the difference between respect and fear.  My strength is not respected by anyone besides Boram.  To the rest, I am more like a monster.  Ready to charge at the nearest enemy. _  
&gt;  
&gt;	When his club broke, he pummeled his way through, helms denting, bones breaking.  Ecstasy and rage clouded his mind as he rampaged, his vision clouded in crimson.  He saw everything clearly, including the fear across Jarvan\u2019s face as Sion removed his final obstacle.    
&gt;  
&gt;        _I was fine with this.  In fact, I Relished it.  I do not deny that I am a monster, but can a monster be a father?  Do I want another like me?_  
&gt;  
&gt;	\u201cJarvan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d  He was upon the king in seconds, his bloodied and calloused hands wrapped tightly around the throat of demacian royalty.  His heartbeat echoed like the drums of war as he slowly sundered the Lightshield of Demacia.  
&gt;  
&gt;     _The answer still haunts me, or maybe I just do not want to say it.  It doesn\u2019t matter...you matter.  Our child matters.  I have never let fear control me and I will not start now!  I will be there for you and our child._  
&gt;  
&gt;	The drums ceased.  Air seeped through Sion\u2019s lungs one final time as Jarvan\u2019s sword pierced his heart.    
&gt;  
&gt;      _I promise._  
&gt;  
&gt;	Death did not weaken the grip of Noxus.  Despite his struggles, the demacian king could not avoid his fate.  Sion\u2019s corpse stood like a monument to the will of Noxus, and Jarvan\u2019s soon joined him as a symbol of those who would stand against them.  
&gt;  
&gt;      _With love, Sion._

 **Why we're not releasing the Ahri Statue**

&gt;Hi Everyone,  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019ve decided not to release the Ahri Statue as scheduled on 12/7. We heard players\u2019 feedback on Ahri\u2019s face and want to take this opportunity to revisit this element of her design. Our aim is to make each experience you have with Riot Games Merch an amazing one -- whether it\u2019s buying a poro at an esports event, unlocking Urf Figure via the Figure Fest mini-game, or unboxing one of our larger statues. We missed the mark on Ahri and we apologize.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SO HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?**  
&gt;We want our statues to be accessible to as many players as possible and are constantly evaluating techniques that will allow us to deliver awesome art at lower price points. For Ahri, the goal was to deliver an epic statue at a retail price significantly below our polyresin Twisted Fate piece -- despite Ahri being similar in size and featuring greater sculpt complexity. To do this, we elected to make her body and face out of another material called PVC, which we used for the Thresh statue.  
&gt;  
&gt;This decision and its associated production processes yielded a loss of resolution in the finer details and structure of Ahri\u2019s face. We also applied Ahri\u2019s eye makeup too heavily in production. All of this resulted in a final product that failed to fully capture Ahri\u2019s unique look.  
&gt;  
&gt;**WHAT WILL WE DO NOW?**  
&gt;We\u2019re going to work with our manufacturing partners to find a solution that will delight Ahri fans while simultaneously meeting our goal of keeping statue prices contained. This will involve sending Ahri back to the factory and rethinking the design and construction of her face.

 **Why we're not releasing the Ahri Statue**

&gt;Hi Everyone,  
&gt;  
&gt;We\u2019ve decided not to release the Ahri Statue as scheduled on 12/7. We heard players\u2019 feedback on Ahri\u2019s face and want to take this opportunity to revisit this element of her design. Our aim is to make each experience you have with Riot Games Merch an amazing one -- whether it\u2019s buying a poro at an esports event, unlocking Urf Figure via the Figure Fest mini-game, or unboxing one of our larger statues. We missed the mark on Ahri and we apologize.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SO HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?**  
&gt;We want our statues to be accessible to as many players as possible and are constantly evaluating techniques that will allow us to deliver awesome art at lower price points. For Ahri, the goal was to deliver an epic statue at a retail price significantly below our polyresin Twisted Fate piece -- despite Ahri being similar in size and featuring greater sculpt complexity. To do this, we elected to make her body and face out of another material called PVC, which we used for the Thresh statue.  
&gt;  
&gt;This decision and its associated production processes yielded a loss of resolution in the finer details and structure of Ahri\u2019s face. We also applied Ahri\u2019s eye makeup too heavily in production. All of this resulted in a final product that failed to fully capture Ahri\u2019s unique look.  
&gt;  
&gt;**WHAT WILL WE DO NOW?**  
&gt;We\u2019re going to work with our manufacturing partners to find a solution that will delight Ahri fans while simultaneously meeting our goal of keeping statue prices contained. This will involve sending Ahri back to the factory and rethinking the design and construction of her face.  
&gt;

 **[Unpopular Opinion] Sightstone was the Real Problem Causing Vision Glut, not Trinkets.**

&gt;Let's be clear, I don't want sightstone nerfed. As an essential item for supports, nerfing it will make it feel like an even more lackluster item slot, yet it will still be mandatory for the amount of power vision brings to the team even if it's a painful purchase for the support.  
&gt;  
&gt;I want it REMOVED. Being the team ward bitch was never a fun part of being a support, losing an item slot and 800 gold on an already cashed starved champion is a kick to face, and it's just insult to injury that trinkets were stripped of the ability to let non-supports contribute meaningfully to vision.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once upon a time, sightstone was a major QoL improvement to supports, who had previously been required to keep a slot open to just to stash all the wards they needed to buy. It simultaneously added some stat functionality so wards felt like less of a personal stat burden, and got rid of the constant gold sink of buying 5 wards every trip to the fountain.  
&gt;  
&gt;But then we got trinkets, and suddenly everyone could contribute to vision without sacrificing room in their build. Sightstone was still as strong as ever, so it was still a must for supports, but it meant they weren't alone in their pursuit of ward coverage. And Heaven forbid, if the support DIDN'T want to lose a slot for sightstone, at level 9 they could keep full ward coverage up, as could everyone else who didn't op for ward clearing or long range scrying instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, the extreme levels of ward coverage both trinkets and sightstone caused meant that aggression was much less effective, so the game became dominated by passive play. The optimal strategy was to stall out any lead you had; vision dominance means never picking fights you can potentially lose. The game revolved around not throwing, around taking objectives without risking a full on fight. Usually this meant sieging turrets  with your ADC, roaming to the next objective as a group if the losing team tries to contest it, never risking any actual engagement. There's no urgency to push one's lead when vision prevents your opponents from making any plays that could threaten it.  
&gt;  
&gt;High vision gameplay is really stale, so Riot severely toned down the power of warding trinkets. Where the upgraded green trinket used to keep 3 wards out at once, it's down to less than 1 until level 18. While I'm glad there's less vision, I'm not happy that vision is back to primarily a support function. There's no good reason a support with sightstone should provide more vision than the rest of the team combined. This is exactly what the nerfs to trinkets did, and the removal of green wards means non-supports can't contribute even if they want to.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd like to see the warding coverage sightstone offers spread amongst the team through stronger trinkets, and sightstone itself removed. The strength of vision means sightstone will always be required of supports so as long as it exists, but only at great expense to their power elsewhere. Supports alone are forced to make itemization and play-style sacrifices in order to provide vision for the entire team, and this lost power is one of the largest reasons so many players find them unfulfilling to play.

 **Lets Fix Bard in 5.25**

&gt;Ultimately Bard has massive pitfalls where he should have exploitable weaknesses.  Since release we have done nothing but buff him, the truly helpful buffs being changes to his passive in 5.7 and the 5.17 changes.  Currently planned changes will not accomplish their intended goals, but rather ensure that when the core of the problems that burden him is actually dealt with that Bard will be completely overbearing.  In my opinion the following changes would allow Bard  "to access that early game fantasy" in a healthy and fair way.  
&gt;  
&gt;NERFS:  
&gt;1) Q Revert to base damage and base scaling  
&gt;--------- 80/125/170/215/260 (+0.65 Ability Power) =&gt; (75/100/145/180/215 (+.5 Ability Power)  
&gt;  
&gt;2) W Revert to mana cost and heal ratios (currently proposed buff for 5.24)  
&gt;--------- 90 mana at all ranks =&gt; 100/105/110/115/120  
&gt;--------- min 0.3AP =&gt; min 0.2AP //// max 0.6AP =&gt; max 0.45  
&gt;  
&gt;BUFFS:  
&gt;1) Passive   
&gt;-------- Chimes spawn every 0:50 in pairs (excluding 1:40 and 2:30), cannot spawn in enemy jungle for first 5:00 =&gt; Chimes spawn every 0:25, cannot spawn in the enemy jungle for the first 5:00 [Potential chimes gathered @2:05 3=&gt;5 &amp; @5:00 10=&gt;12]  
&gt;  
&gt;2) E New Passive Component  
&gt;------- Bard's Meeps and Q gain bonus range based off rank in E  
&gt;------- +0 Range at all ranks =&gt; +10/+20/+30/+40/+50  
&gt;------- (Rank 5 Meep auto range 500 =&gt; 550 and Q 500/1000 =&gt; 550/1100)  
&gt;  
&gt;3) W Bugfix [(Bugged Since 5.8)](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/gAdXllyF-bards-self-cast-w-no-longer-works)  
&gt;------ Props igobananas  
&gt;------ When self-cast Bard currently places a shrine immediately beneath him instead of using the cast animation that he uses on his allies.  This results in a interruption of his movement commands and heals him for slightly more hp than it should. When using self cast W, Bard should use the same animation that he uses when cast directly on allies and shouldn't interrupt his movement (Think Nami W)  
&gt;  
&gt;Summary of Goals  
&gt;Encourage the highest win % skill order [Q/W/Q/E/Q/R =&gt; R/Q/E/W](http://champion.gg/champion/bard)   
&gt;Encourage Utility Builds over AP Builds  
&gt;Soften early game match-ups by letting him access the power ALREADY in his kit  
&gt;-------- (potential 5 chimes @ 2:05 instead of potential 6 chimes @ 3:20 )  
&gt;-------- Bugfixed W so you can juke skillshots as well as you manage your mana

 **This Is How I Feel About Riot &amp; League**

&gt;**Before you start reading, understand that I am not bashing on Riot in any way, and this is honestly just how I feel about Riot, so any Rioter that sees this take this as criticism, not an attack. Just to get some comments out the way yes I do know that my grammar is a bit terrible, and yes I know that I am Bronze III so this information isn't coming from an experienced LCS big plays League member. There will be a TL;DR at the end, but I highly recommend that you read the whole thing. Riot I have devoted lots of time, effort, and money into your game. Ban me for posting this if you want, but just remember that I love this game and this is just simply how I feel you guys are doing.**  
&gt;****  
&gt;**1. Lazy**  
&gt;Before you go to the comment section talking about the new Dragon Trainer Tristana skin, or the Preseason 6 changes, hear me out. A number has been revealed that Riot has made about $1 billion dollars in 2014. And if you didn't know that's a lot of freaking money. And unless Riot has over 1 billion employees, I'm sure that they could buy each and every one of their employees at least one decent house with that kind of money. And yes, I know it says about. So yay for Riot they make tons of money, but what do we get? Bard.  
&gt;  
&gt;I started truly playing this game in February of 2015, and made my account back in 2014. I was not here for the Preseason changes, but the new champion release should have been way better. I don't mind Bard, I mind the fact that Bard is outright terrible. He can not only make the game a 4v6, but overall is completely useless to the team either way. He has 1 damaging ability with terrible range and a hard to land stun, a terrible heal (I do understand that you can go AP if you want a pretty good heal. The problem is that Bard would be too squishy and get teared to shreds), and an ultimate that can either make a game a 4v6, or completely fail. His tunnel is the only thing I don't mind.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lore, lore, lore. Lore is a very important aspect in any game really. Lore is what makes a champion truly unique, and what let's the player really feel a connection to their favorite champion(s). If you were a Yasuo main, and in his lore it talked about how much practice was put into mastering the wind wall, then every time you'd use the ability you would instantly think about that. All we have is either lore that is completely irrelevant to the actual champion (Example: Gnar, who's lore is in the perspective of who appears to be Rengar), or 2 sentence lore (Example: Tristana, and more recently, Illaoi).  
&gt;****  
&gt;**2. Money**  
&gt;No matter what at the end of the day League of Legends is a business. This is how people get payed and put food on the plate. I get that. But making me pay money for an icon, or a simple recolor? I don't think so. Seeing the way Riot wants things set up, Skins and Champions should be the only thing you should buy for RP. And I wouldn't mind buying a bit more money for a skin, if I knew that it's the only thing I would be paying for instead of an icon or a ward. Ward Skins and Summoner Icons should be able to be bought for IP and RP, instead of just RP. Even if it was 6300 IP, it's better then paying actual money. I feel like Riot should also reward players for getting certain accomplishments. So if you bought every champion in the store, you would get rewarded with something you can only get from that achievement. Whether it's a ward, skin, summoner icon, whatever it may be.  
&gt;****  
&gt;**3. Ranked System &amp; Banning**  
&gt;I personally do not like the ranked system. I feel like you should be getting rewarded for doing good as an individual. So even if you lost a game, you would still get about 10% of the LP you would gain from a victory. Even if it was 3 or 4 LP, at least you gained something. This should be based on the amount of damage you dealt to champions, along with your kill count. I include the amount of damage because someone can troll you and kill steal you the whole game. Damage just shows that you have the potential to carry games. This is not perfect, but the bottom line here is that the ranked system is not enjoyed by many and whether or not you like it we can all agree that it needs improvement.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for banning, I feel like people just report nowadays because a person pissed them off or got them mad. So even if they weren't doing anything wrong, you find that they should be reported for thinking that your build of AP Garen was weird. There needs to be an improved system, I'll even leave a poll to see if you would rather have Riot fix things that are wrong with the game that the community want (new ranked/banning system, better lore, nerf of leblanc, whatever it may be) over new skins and champions.  
&gt;****  
&gt;**TL;DR:Riot has created something amazing and I feel that Riot can do a much better job. I feel like they don't really listen to the community all that often, or at least not as much as they should be. If Riot simply just did at least one thing I mentioned here, it would make the game way more enjoyable. I feel like some Rioters even have the heart and passion to really listen to the community and improve, but I feel like something is holding them back. So in other words, I feel like we need more of a "what the players want" company then "It's just a business" company.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is how I feel. In no way is this meant to offend anyone, but I feel like I should tell Riot how I feel. Even if this is one voice, one voice could be enough to represent an entire community. I hope that whoever reads has a good day, and let's make League have a brighter future, and make it grow to become something even better then it is now.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Because I'm dumb I forgot to make a poll. Here it is: http://strawpoll.me/6217267

 **Thoughts on Health Drain mechanic to rework Spell Vamp**

&gt;I'm start thinking ones I read the description of Hunter's Talisman:  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt; UNIQUE \u2013 TOOTH: Damaging a monster applies HEALTH DRAIN, which deals 25 magic damage over 5 seconds while restoring as much as health.  
&gt;  
&gt;So what if spell vamp could function like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;* Spell vamp is a defensive stat which deals an amount of damage over 5 seconds while restoring as much as health when damaging with either champion abilities. It only works for active champion abilities that do not modify basic attacks or apply on-hit effects (including True damage abilities).  
&gt;  
&gt;This means spell vamp is now a flat number rather than an percentage.  
&gt;  
&gt;#Items  
&gt;  
&gt;* {{item:3303}}: Now gains 10 spellvamp  
&gt;Tribute doesn't deal damage anymore  
&gt;So that's about 10 damage dealed &amp; 10 damage healed after 5 seconds  
&gt;* {{item:3098}}{{item:3092}} {{item:2301}}: Now gains 15 spellvamp  
&gt;Tribute doesn't deal damage anymore  
&gt;So that's about 15 damage dealed &amp; 15 damage healed after 5 seconds  
&gt;* {{item:3145}}: Now gives 30 spell vamp  
&gt;* {{item:3152}}: Now gives 40 spell vamp  
&gt;* {{item:3146}}: Is now an unique passive similar what they did with {{item:3812}}   
&gt;  
&gt;The healing scales with bonusses like {{item:3065}}   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Thoughts?
