 that long??? just kidding were they still good?  not as good as right out of the oven i bet. i'm glad they were consumed.  i am doing well...market aside.....i worked out chest, tris , bis and abs this morn. i've got a new anal retentive running schedule made up...ha ha we'll see how that goes.  let me know what time i can shoot for having dinner ready.  I may swing by a store on the way home. talk to you laters, mo 
 i'm sry..hunbun 
 I exercised my options today...for various reasons.  First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.  Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.  Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee "consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.  Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.  OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.  So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written. Talk to you later hun L-me 
 I would wear nice slacks and a nice shirt...maybe like you would wear to a nice dinner if you didn't have to wear a jacket..that kind of thing.  I don't think a suit is necessary.  See you friday! Mo 
 suitable for customer.  i may take a nap..will be ready at 7 though. 
 Kori,  I won't be able to make it this evening.  Please tell Scott "adios and best of luck" for me. Thanks, Mo. 
 dinner at tutto bene (beef stew) blues jam at Dan Electros Blues bar.......on west 24th.  me you and suebob so far 
 Alright!  Lets start the invites... I'll invite suebob and anyone she wants to bring with...she's got a friend from outta town. May invite Keith and Tracy...he wants to check out our house/neighborhood. May even invite Dennis from cooking school and his wife since they live close by...hmmmm this could get a bit large..which is not to bad....we could set up horseshoes in the front yard...that would be fun. We'll talk more tonight and construct an email......Based on our headcount we can figure out what the best food is to fix and then possible divy up some of the bringins.  Latersky 
 Hey there,  Ironically I got the card the same day I sent the email.  Count us in for sure.  Still no date for us.  I'll give you plenty of notice. Take care and i'll talk to you again soon. Mo. 
 you could bbq a big piece of meat like you did a while back on cindy..........or we could do fajitas...robbie could make the pico 
 what do you think about having another get together at our house on saturday.....we could barbeque or come up with something else.....it's so nice outside...i think we should take advantage of the weather.  let me know. 
 Thanks.  Give me a ring when you have a chance.  I baked both the cakes last night.  Love to tell you about it. By the way...that is the best damn chocolate cake i have ever had...that was exactly what i was looking for. Talk to you later.  Mo. 713-853-1917 
 Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable. Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.  Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making financiers.......my oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you soon. Mo. 
 Count me in, but the dogs will probably have issues.  Talk to you later. 
 Excellent....i will be in town that weekend.  You just name the time and place. I was definitely mint-juleped...i love that.  I think those were the last days of disco for mo. I plan to be very lame
