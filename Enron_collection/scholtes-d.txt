 Hey Monica!  Long time no hear!  Just wanted to make sure you and Kristian are doing fine.  Morale here is extremely low.  I'm sure its the same there.  But we continue to be busy.  Good thing for all of us!  When are you guys coming back to the states?  By the way, how are your parents?  I hope they are safe and well.  Keep in touch!  Diana 
 thanks

 julie,  this is first of the month week for us and busy!  if there is no one else, let me know and we can try to re-arrange our coverage.   Thanks,  diana 
 sean just asked who jeff shields was AGAIN 
 Wonder what their nomination will be for Nov?  Thanks Diana 
 O.K.!  Just to keep you appraised of what I'm doing,  I have left a message with Bob Sullivan @ CISO and I spoke to WAPA.  I think the call to WAPA was just to notify them that they won't be managing Shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal.  I'm going to be working with Bob Sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes.  Not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that?  You can update Gerry though, for me.  I appreciate your help!  Thanks  Diana 
 Vicky,  Thank you again for you assistance with this process.  As you requested, this is our notification to PG&E of our purchase from the City of Shasta Lake of their COTP Transmission Capacity bi-directionally.  The term of the deal will include the months of November and December 2001.  Also as you requested, I faxed the Confirmation Notice between Shasta and EPMI to your office.  I have listed my office number below if you have any further questions.  Thanks again,  Diana Scholtes Enron West Trading 503-464-3807 diana.scholtes@enron.com 
 Lynn,  Who can I talk to regarding my password to get into the TSIN site?  Diana Scholtes Enron 503-464-3807 diana.scholtes@enron.com

 Paul,  Put me down for a 21" and a 19" if there's availability.  diana 
 not that we have much equity in our 401 anymore, but we may need to look at which fund to invest in.  ds 
 I went into Scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out.  I'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry.  I believe these should synchronize, or they read off of one another. ??  diana  Deal # 517673.1 and 517674.1 
 Hey what's the scoop on this?  diana 
 FYI..... 
 Stewart,  I left you an envelope with information regarding the City of K. Falls. Not sure if you forwarded it to anyone to begin the process for credit approval.  Can you please respond to Ray's E-mail?  Let me know if there is something else you need me to do.  ds 
 We match with $424.80 owing to PGE for the month of December 01  ds 
 Steve Hall is contacting Al Paske regarding the transmission contract.  Apparently they have already been discussing this issue.  ds 
 How do we feel about having approval/denial authority in E-tag for all of the El Paso stuff.  How does it work now?  ds 
 Either Saturday will be fine.  diana 
 Hey Young!  Perfect timing I tell you, Natalie came down with the croup.  Hence I'm staying here to take care of her cuz Dad's out of town also.  Real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there!  Have a good time!  Maybe we can go hiking around here!  Diana

Every account you have on this day is off. Or maybe I have the wrong index! 
 Hi Amy!  So glad to have you back!  I talked to Grace this morning and she said it was ups'd yesterday.  I submitted it last week, so I'm not sure why the delay.  Please let me know if you don't receive it today.  Talk to you soon!  Diana

 10/11  Sales to PGE- Missing 50 mw llh buy/resale System to Mid-c. 
 Hey----We didn't use it on the 10th.  So i revised the spreadsheet and updated Enpower.  ds 
 I talked to Arvina this morning and she noticed that she has calculated the loss return using the wrong indicies.  She will be fixing that this morning.  I am attaching a summary of the loss return calculation and a quick summary of checking I did against Arvina spreadsheet.  There is a deal that we entered in differently, but the net result is the same.  Diana 
 Steve-  Below is the wire transfer information needed to pay the November bill.  Paul-  Also attached are blank enabling agreements needed for transmission.  Mark Hackney said the turn around for this can be 1 to 2 days and with credit established he can waive the deposits.  Diana 
  10/11 We are in trouble.  You have some price points that don't make sense.  We should go thru this day together.  10/12  To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC .....there should be 3 mw off peak priced at 22.27.  Total Purch= $74,629.93  10/17 You don't show the lending; 13 mw off peak at system.  10/21  You should have a total of 1200 mw @ $29.21  adder and 600 @ $24.81.  I fixed the 600 mw descrepancy that we had.  Total Purchase = $103,251.56 Total Sale = $ 96,342.80  10/22 To PCW-EPMI Sale -MC you show 400 @ 24.81.  I show 200 @ that price and 200 should be priced with a 60 cent adder for busbar/mid.c Total Purch= $98,692.26  10/28 To BPA-EPMI(PGE SYS)  You have 1 mw priced @ 28.73 instead of 28.83.  Total Purch= $76,287.15  10/29  To BPA EPMI-RP-LS MC ....is priced at $35.35 and it should be at 34.47  Total Purch= $118,078.79  10/31  To MPC-EPMI Colstrip - you have 14 mw priced at $30 and it should be at 30.48.  Total Purch= $123,318.72  send you some more later!!!  ds 
 Sales to PGE:  10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you.  10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????  10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you.  10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  Don't know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??  I'll send more when i get thru it!!  diana 
 Leslie,  I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  I also understand, after talking to J
