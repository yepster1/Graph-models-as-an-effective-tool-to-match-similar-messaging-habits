 I thought that you were going Skiing?  The guys we went hunting w/ didn't know what they were doing!  We drank a lot of beer & whisky, played paintball, ate BBQ & sat around the campfire.  Got an open night to grab drinks this week if you are not going skiing?  Late,  DB 281-787-0029 
 I'm goin to the gym in a couple of min.  Did you want to meet about the mave plans?  DB Ext: 3-0392 Cell: 281-787-0029 
 When are y'all headin' out of town?  DB 
  That is great! 
 U suck! 
 This is very good, just like the real thing!  Did you try to call my cell yesterday, it rang and your cell number popped up on the caller ID but when I answered there was no reponse.  I hope that you know that it is OK for you to call me when you want to.  Drop me a line or call and tell me what night is good for you this week.  Take care,  Don 
 Hey,  After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.  If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.  If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.  Don Baughman Wk: 3-0392 Cell: 281-787-0029 
 Wow, I have not seen this email address pop up in a LONG TIME!  Did you fall down a well and were just recently rescued?  DB 281-787-0029 
 Hey,  I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.  We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!   So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a lin
