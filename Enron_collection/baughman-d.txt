 I thought that you were going Skiing?  The guys we went hunting w/ didn't know what they were doing!  We drank a lot of beer & whisky, played paintball, ate BBQ & sat around the campfire.  Got an open night to grab drinks this week if you are not going skiing?  Late,  DB 281-787-0029 
 I'm goin to the gym in a couple of min.  Did you want to meet about the mave plans?  DB Ext: 3-0392 Cell: 281-787-0029 
 When are y'all headin' out of town?  DB 
  That is great! 
 U suck! 
 This is very good, just like the real thing!  Did you try to call my cell yesterday, it rang and your cell number popped up on the caller ID but when I answered there was no reponse.  I hope that you know that it is OK for you to call me when you want to.  Drop me a line or call and tell me what night is good for you this week.  Take care,  Don 
 Hey,  After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.  If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.  If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.  Don Baughman Wk: 3-0392 Cell: 281-787-0029 
 Wow, I have not seen this email address pop up in a LONG TIME!  Did you fall down a well and were just recently rescued?  DB 281-787-0029 
 Hey,  I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.  We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!   So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time.  Take care,  Don

 Please be aware that there is a scheduled power outage in ECS this weekend on Saturday, January 19, 2002. The outage is scheduled from 2:00pm - 4:00 pm.  There should be no impact with the exception of a loss of power to the plasma screens.  In order to protect the plasma screens from becoming damaged during the power shutdown, technical support will need your assistance in turning off all plasmas in your area this Friday at close of business. Desktop Support technicians will assist with turning back on the plasmas on Tuesday morning, January 22, 2002 starting at 6:00 am (as Monday is a holiday).  I am sending this to the admins in ECS. Please forward to anyone I may have missed and please assist us in spreading the word to anyone who may be working on Saturday. Again, the only impact will be the loss of the plasma screens.  Thank you for your assistance in advance! Please call me if you have any questions/concerns  S.

Find a night when I can cook you supper and have some beer & cider. I've got my sister's birthday party at Mom & Dad's tonight, but open the rest of the week.  Drop me a line when you have a chance.

 Yes, we are. 
 Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.  In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as to not offend international students.  I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was offending others.  I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants; however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and  apparently some
