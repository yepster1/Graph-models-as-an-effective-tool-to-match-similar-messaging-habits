 I thought that you were going Skiing?  The guys we went hunting w/ didn't know what they were doing!  We drank a lot of beer & whisky, played paintball, ate BBQ & sat around the campfire.  Got an open night to grab drinks this week if you are not going skiing?  Late,  DB 281-787-0029

 This is very good, just like the real thing!  Did you try to call my cell yesterday, it rang and your cell number popped up on the caller ID but when I answered there was no reponse.  I hope that you know that it is OK for you to call me when you want to.  Drop me a line or call and tell me what night is good for you this week.  Take care,  Don 
 Hey,  After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.  If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.  If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.  Don Baughman Wk: 3-0392 Cell: 281-787-0029 
 Wow, I have not seen this email address pop up in a LONG TIME!  Did you fall down a well and were just recently rescued?  DB 281-787-0029 
 Hey,  I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.  We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!   So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time.  Take care,  Don

 NO 
 Yes, we are. 
 Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.  In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as to not offend international students.  I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was offending others.  I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants; however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.  First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way" has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought, bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.  We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society -- learn our language!  "In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.  God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song, and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.  We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.  The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.  Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom, the  right to leave.  Barry Loudermilk If you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!! It is time to take a  stand!! 
 COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.  One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by Coach R.C. Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.  After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign white substance that they found was the goal line. 
 Congratulations!  That is FANTASTIC!  When is the date?  When will you next be in town?  I'll buy you a beer in celebration.  Take care,  Don

 Chuck,  I have been on vacation since the middle of last week.  I have now received your multiple emails and vmails.

I appreciate your and Miles' patience regarding the possibility of Enron creating and trading a TradersNews Cinergy product on EOL.  We are currently still evaluating the TradersNews historical data and market conditions pertaining to the viability of such a product.  I will contact you as soon as I am able to move forward with this project on this side.  The best way to reach me is currently via e-mail.  Thanks,  Don Baughman Commercial Manager Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 713-853-0392

 Frank was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He spotted a small brown bear and shot it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear. The black bear said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have rough sex." Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it. There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him. The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again, Frank thought it was better to comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before Frankfinally recovered. Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear said: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?"

 Bad-dream Shotwell,  I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to
