 Hi Sue I still have not received a check for voucher NO. 0100067175 FOR $2,2298.95. 
 Swerzbin will be out of the office, but available on cell phone for the week of Nov 5 to Nov 9.  Back in the office Nov12.  Driscoll will trade the EOL and download curves. 
 Driscoll on curves and pricing--- 
 Driz will be doing the curves...   be on my cell phone. 
 The market last week for the flat MC was about $31: that difference would be 9.50 = $2,654,02 nominal for the increased mws.  The loss of the delivery value is about $.75/MWh- (about $2.3 million nominal).  The loss of the option is probably about $1 million.   Overall, you did a very job I think its worth $1.5 million- if you go by the numbers its 0. 
 Here's a more detailed reason.  Thanks Mike

 I believe Chris Calger has lined up a corporate jet out of Portland.... 
 I was just checking to make sure we are ticketed for the Aug 30  --returning 9/2??? Please let me know.   Thanks- Mike 
 I should be here -- Muni Man.   Thanks.. 
 Glenn-  I really have no interest in Lewis River or Klamath since there is zero correlation to the Columbia flows....  However, I'll offer the whole deal at $3 million per year with the hair if they're insistent.  Or we'll do any power options the weather desk wants. 
 This is what the broker has --  I wonder if you could check it out and see if it's regulated flow or not.  Also we can use whatever proxy we want if you have any suggestions. 
 I'll be out this Thursday and Friday- Mike Driscoll will handle EOL & curves-  Have a great 4th!!!! 
 Please transfer $100,000 from LTNW to "origination"  this is for Laird's work on a long-term City of Santa Clara (NP-15)  deal done 4/18/01. 
 Jill could you try 7/5 to 7/7 or 7/12 to 7/14 for Mike and my trip to Calgary.

 The hotel's no is 011-52-144-34444  --  Talk to Raul  in reservations-- he says there still rooms available  (mostly garden views-- but it's still the place to go) 
  Kim below are the websites to book the hotel, Melia San Lucas-- I'd like room #502-  we also would like a suite for evening get togethers with the whole group.  Thanks. 
 This is the info.-  Kim Hillis is making the reservations (I hope there are rooms available this late)    A couple guys here have stayed there and said it's awesome.  With a great beach, close to town and golf. There's jet skis and boats right there.  I'm up for chartering a a catamaran for snorkeling and cruisin' all day.  http://www.mexicotravelnet.com/loscabos/hotels/meliasanlucas.htm  http://www.cabofishingvacations.com/melia.htm 
 I believe this is the best choice-  Great hotel, close to town with golf, tennis, fishing right there.   The rooms are great and the beach is awesome.  Check it out!!!  Let me know what you think and we'll book it.  http://www.mexicotravelnet.com/loscabos/hotels/meliasanlucas.htm  http://www.cabofishingvacations.com/melia.htm 
 I'll be in Calgary Thrs. June 21 & 22.. 
 Mikey all our fundies stuff is still locked down ...  try these web-sites:  Powerlytix.com and Friedwired.com (pw: enron, enron).  Next week we'll open the stuff back up ... I'm guessing exports to be close 3,000 MWs into Cal  through the Spring run-off  then up to 5,000 MW thru July  (on average about 4,250 MW) then dropping in Aug and Sept back to 2,500. 
 I'm in for a chair- Thanks- (how did you end doing asset sales & HR??) 
 Driscoll will do EOL & curves-- I'll be available on the cell 
 Mike Driscoll will be taking care of the curves and any pricing requests.  Have a great weekend!!!! 
 The last two paycheck I've received have been wrong.  They do not include the deferral portion of my contract-- it's $1,606 per pay period.  It should show up und
