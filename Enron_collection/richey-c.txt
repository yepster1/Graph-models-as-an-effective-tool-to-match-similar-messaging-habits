 dim-sum,  hey, i was up until at least 8:30 last night.  you should get a cell phone.  (or a pager if you're too cheap for that).  what's going on?  you're one of three friends i have in calgary and i don't see you anymore. drinks at the auburn saloon?  golf this weekend?   ice-man  vegas baby... 
 Bob (and all),  let's postpone until tomorrow (or next week if you're not available) - no need to force the meeting.  can you do it tomorrow at the normal time?  Cooper 
 hi omar-  i called your cell.  here are my phone numbers:  home	403 262 0205 work	403 974 6946 cell	403 512 3312  give me a call when you have a chance. 
 can you shrink the header height in xnav so that it is just tall enough to house the AlbertaPower icon? 
 Bob,  we had the meeting today called your desk at 1pm PDX time with no answer.   not sure what went on there because we also didn't get your voicemail.  we'll have to catch up next week.

 I think something was wrong with the phone system - I should have thought to call your cell.  next time...  Cooper 
 Tricia,  can you send me a version of that spreadsheet you have set up for me? a printout would be fine (i know there's some other info in there that doesn't relate to me.)  Thanks, Cooper 
  how should i go about getting voicemail enabled on my cellphone?  thx, cooper 
 thank you. 
 Hey Andy,  the days are getting nice up here now - the winter was a bit brutal, but i'm getting stoked for the next few months.  it seems like you just moved into that place no the east side.  time flies.  my old apartment was on 15th and Madison and the building was called the La Salle. When there were openings, there would be a posting on the front door.  and the building manager's phone number is also on a plaque there and you could call him to see if he is expecting any vacancies.  it seems like the beginning of the summer might be a good time to pick something up.  take care,  Cooper 
 just a reminder that i'm trying to get my vpn working again when my digital certificate has expired (or something).

 talked to zufferli about coming down and everything is fine.  found a cheap flight out on thursday at 3pm, arriving in pdx at 5:50 and leaving sunday at 5:07.  does that sound like the right timeframe?  can i crash at your place while i'm in town? 
  I'm getting some error messages when I try to use the Houston mail server to send out automated messages - it seems like 'external' messages are getting rejected (messages going to my enron.com account work fine.)  the error message i get back is below.  Are you seeing any similar problems? 
 I've made the appropriate change in the AlbertaPower database, but it won't be automatically pushed to PETE since the pool doesn't change the data they have on the web (they just send out the letter.)  i.e., you may have to pull it in by hand. 
 Great.  Thanks Camille.  I get into Nashville on 10:16 on friday night and my flight leaves at 2:25 on Sunday.  Sounds like the christening schedule will fits perfectly into that.  It's exciting that Cameron's christening will be in front of everyone!  See you soon.  Cooper

  please look into this.  apparently a web server in portland was infected so it is no joke. 
 Hi Stephanie,  I believe you helped me set up my EOL trading account (ADM26984) to trade the alberta hourly market and I was hoping you could enable me to have read only access to West Power, U.S. Gas, and Canadian Gas products.  I can't seem to set up myQuotes for these under my ADM account and I can't run my old readonly account and my ADM account at the same time.  Thanks.  Cooper 
 These are to bring the Alberta Power Decision Support Web Hosting infrastructure up to the Houston hardware spec (2 servers required)  Also. I'm contemplating using this configuration to replace the box running things under my desk at the moment (2 servers required) 
 While our webserver up here hasn't been hammered yet, I've been concerned about similar issues (web hardware and administration) for awhile up here. Given that the web is our primary medium I agree with you and Tim that it's been neglected.  Administration is an ongoing issue and I'm not sure what a good solution for this is, but relying on Houston for this is not an option as far as I'm concerned (unless they change their draconian policies).  At the moment Chris Wiebe is officially administrating our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying on Colin for most day-to-day admin.  This isn't great since Colin is a contractor.  We should definitely team up on this one as I don't think IIS administration is even a quarter-time job, but it is vital.  I'm in a similar spot on SQL Server issues - Chris is the admin, but he's moving more toward the development side of IT with each passing week.  In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through Dan Dietrich and spoke with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.  He sent me the following documentation standard which I hope I forwarded onto you (as it's quite good).  I'm pushing to move to the Houston standard for web servers which is two clustered pizza boxes (DL360s).    I just got the price quote for these and it would be about 9000 US$ for the two boxes (basically dual proc PIII 930, 512 MB RAM, 2 9GB drives)  You mentioned moving the dev environment from prod, but I'm not sure if you're interested in splitting the web from the file server.  I think this is a good idea (more for file server reliability than anything else.)  There's some time critical data up here that we can't recover if we miss it the first time, so I'm trying to make the backend as fault-tolerant as possible.  plus, it seems like it's likely a cheap performance and fault tolerance boost for the web, as well.  Sorry to hear about your web troubles yesterday, but hopefully it will serve as a catalyst for us to clean things up.  Should we set up a call to talk about this?

 if you have a bit of time, you might find it entertaining. 
 As far as Houston standards, they made sense to me and they seemed to have more expertise in the matter.  How bad did things get yesterday? 
 here's my flight info.  had to get a more expensive flight ($340 i think) with the monday flight out.

 can you move the xnav security level somewhere less conspicious?  (perhaps at the bottom of the menu.  thx, cooper 
 Tim,  I'll be in portland on Friday (18th) and the first half of Monday (21st).  Jeff asked me to come down and help him with some California data issues and it seemed like a visit was long overdue.   I hope to be able to sit down with you and show some of the work I've been doing up here.  The only specific issue I have is to get your feedback on the hydro project we're working on, which is slowly coming together, but I'd like to give you a general tour and talk about future direction.  Hopefully you're around and can squeeze me into your schedule.  It's hard to believe I've been up here for 5 months!  Cooper 
 hey,  i'll be in town next friday through monday (18th - 21st).  Don't have any real plans for the weekend. Richter mentioned something about reach the beach, but squeeze me into your plans for the weekend.  i leave it to you to decide when you want to get your ass handed to you in pong... 
 i'm getting them... 
 Bob,  sounds good, but the page you sent me doesn't work, maybe i need a cookie or it's only temporary.  what are the basic specs?  -c 
   i plotted the next month, which I think probably look better (at least demand isn't above supply for the entire region)

 Dan/Tim,  Good news.  The problem I was having up here was Telus' fault and unrelated to anything Enron related - just happened to coincide with the problems Tim was having due to Win2K.  Sorry for the false alarm.  Cooper 
 i need a third pc to test applications for win2k.  probably for one day and then i'll be ready to have the second pc under my desk rolled to win2k.

 I'd like to come to Mo Vino - can I register with you (as a co-host)?  don't know about cooking class - i'm not feeling well - what's the topic? 
  I added the CADateTime fields to the tables we talked about.  hope it helps! 
 Hi Kathy,  I was wondering if I could order an Enron Fleece through you.  They don't have them up here in Calgary and I was hoping to pick one up when I was down in Portland last week, but it seems like you were mostly stocked up for summer gear (no fleece).  Would it be possible to do this?  thanks, Cooper 
 I sent the check to reserve a spot - it may take a while to get there from Canada, so please keep me in mind!  thanks, Cooper 
 Colin,  I left you a message at your hotel, but will try here as well.  give me a call when you get a chance  work 	403 974 6946 cell	403 512 3312  basically, the olap server is unresponsive (hangs IE when a cube is brought up)  and Chris can't get a pulse using the OLAP manager.  We're contemplating rebooting the dev box, but are afraid this will trigger the cube deletions we saw before.  any other tactics you can think of?  Cooper 
 thanks Kathy, that would be great.

 can you point me to a copy of Derek's presentation to Lavo and Whalley? 
 Craig,  sorry I missed you at Mo Vino last night.  I made a last minute decision that I need yoga more than alcohol.  i'd like to come to the next one (and I'll register properly).  Cooper 
 Hi Maria,  can you give me a call when you have a chance?  I'm reviewing you and I wanted to make sure I had a comprehensive list of the projects you've been working on.  Not sure I have your right phone number.  403 974 6946  Cooper 
 I don't think the new month (5) came through as a dimension in the "Pool Summary" cube.  can you check into it? 
 i'm doing my best to get you over here, but there's politics involved.  not sure where you'll be if you don't come over here, but Peggy wants your current seat. 
 Great.  Thanks for the info.  I'm happy to see you working on some analysis!  We're working on a project for email alerts/notifications etc. which should be sweet when it's done - I think this would be a good place for collaboration, although we're designing something fairly complex.  also, a possibly very good solution to load/resource balance performance would be to use an OLAP backend. you should definitely consider this when you're working on things.  If you go to albertapower and select the Data Summaries (tabular) link you can go to some pivot tables we have on line which should give you some idea of the speed gain from olap (it's a pain in the ass, but you have to add "http://albertapower" and "http://albertapower.enron.com" to your "trusted sites" in the Tools->Internet Options->Security section.  you may also have to futz with the various settings under the "trusted sites" category.  if you take a look, but can't get past the errors, give me a call and i'll walk you through it. 
 give it about 30 minutes and let me know if it doesn't have the data you need. 
 my certificate has expired and i need to find a way to update it. 
 fyi: i'm calling this watchtower.pl if you're ever looking for it. 
 can you cube this baby?  SELECT * FROM v_FIN_PriceVolatility 
 why don't i meet you at your office, that way you can work if i'm a little late or something?  indian sounds great.  weekend was good - played golf with Greg on sunday at Glen Eagles (course he lives on), which was fun.  i bought a boning knife! 
 I've asked around and I think going to Banff to play some golf sight see is a great thing to do.  Here is a link for some of the courses in the region.  I'm worried about getting tee times, so I'd like to plan things out as soon as possible.  I was thinking of spending a night or two in Banff.  There are a couple of very good courses in Calgary we can play as well - plus general sight seeing.  let me know what you think  love, coop 
 cool.

 thank you! 
 this was Tim Heizenrader's take on the error he was having with the smtp server in portland. 
 jay-roo  i always urine the air  hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I planned to write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it.  i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long time and it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to the reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to go back - just a logistical pain in the ass.  thanks for thinking of me.  it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because the summer is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people and i think i'm probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't enjoy the office culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering that i spend alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate.  have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with the choice of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners than great works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with new york and also served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and then write a book about the wild and crazy life backstage.  i heard you were in a play!  howz that?  coop-er 
 Laura,  I'm having trouble with this username/password combo. Can you test it for me?  Thanks, Cooper

 date time stamp and totals by type get pushed off the bottom of frame when there is a diverse reserve pool (like today), can we move them to the next column over? 
 i'm going to be at an esbi meeting from 9-12 up near you.  would you prefer to meet at the restaurant at 12?  cell is 512 3312 - be leaving here at 8:45 
 Julie,  Morgan Stanley is putting a 300MW peaking plant near reno.  do you know (or can guess) what the heatrate of this unit is?  p.s.  car looks beautiful (should have done that myself long ago...) 
 great.  thanks.  can i fax you the W9?  also, i initially applied to transfer my existing trading account from TD waterhouse, but I would rather not do that, can you put a hold on this?  thx, Cooper 
 great.  thanks greg - i told you about the wireless ethernet stuff i bought right?  i'm excited to set it up.  i don't know if you've seen the site, but www.practicallynetworked.com has some good stuff in it.  coffee or lunch this week works great for me - where are you working downtown?  - c - 
 eze-  glad to hear you are finally putting in an honest day's work!  let me know if you're planning on going to yoga tomorrow (wed).  i did like tuesdays with morrie, do you want me to pass it on to jai or give it back to you?  are you still planning your wine event on saturday?  i want to come, but i think jai is going to a hockey game for work that night.  hopefully i see you tomorrow night at yoga.  - c - 
 i work from 5am to 5pm and it takes me 45 minutes to walk to work from my mom's house where i live unhappily in the basement. 
 i'm going by banker's hall today - any interest in lunch?  i want another round of that blackened chicken. 
 hope this one gets thru... 
 hey gary,  as promised here are names of 2 individuals i would recommend who are experienced in e-tagging, etc.  John Messenger (no longer at enron) 202-0215 taylormje@hotmail.com  Mike Taylor (still with enron) 547-2263  also, I know someone else who doesn't know etag but did a bunch of work for us with the PPA who is in the market and i will forward his resume when he sends it to me - don't have his contact info.  Cooper 
 Mike,  sorry to bother you for this again, but can you send me contact info for you and john m?  thx, cooper 
 hey mara,  i tried to call your phone number, but just got voicemail.  here are my numbers:  (w) 403 974 6946 (h) 403 262 0205 (c) 403 512 3312 - it would be good to chat, but i'll respond here in case you get this and not your voicemail.  also, a better email is "trycooper@hotmail.com" i've been meaning to write you (it's on my list) but haven't probly because i'm not sure what to say ... i'm glad you got in touch.  i hope you had fun in belize with your family.  i checked and i don't have brinda's email - sorry about that.  i might have her phone number athome, but that won't do you much good i don't think.  also if you are checking out SFSU, you may want to look up someone named Ingrid Binswanger - i went to college with her and she is ultra-cool and might be able to give you the lowdown.  i think she is doing some sort of joint degree and is probly still there - not sure though.  um, yeah, i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 8 year statistic! but i'm not sure what relevance that really has.  it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve, it seems like you've been together forever.  it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say, hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result?  it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point.  of course, however you want to handle it is fine by me.  well, if you get this while you are in portland or sf, give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can, otherwise, call or write and let's stay in touch.  good luck shopping for programs.  cooper 
 hi mom,  yup 16.5 x 33 is my size.  thanks!  love, coop 
 this is from my old girlfriend that i hooked up with over break...  i think i should call, eh? 
 eze:  I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind.  I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or let me know where the website is, etc.  i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.  - c - 
 hi emily,  i left fairly quickly on friday night - sorry i didn't say goodbye - i was in a strange mood, maybe being sick and drunk?  anyway, i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more, but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends.  why don't we go to YIM instead of the Space?  i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself, although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him.  i think janice wants to come too?  congratulations on passing all of your courses.  i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic - i wish you had a ceremony to go to, but maybe things are different in canada.  i finished reading tuesdays with morrie - great book - it's good to be reminded of certain things in life.  i did get your call last night but deleted your home number.  i called your cell, but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason.  can you send on your home number?  - c - 
 fine with me. 
 oops, i just sent you a note w/o reading this one.  i might stop by ceilis for a bit. 
 that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?  coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday -- lunch or an afternoon coffee? 
 yah, let's get it out of the way. 
 you're dumb on infusion.  i don't remember, but i think you've got to give her the benefit of the doubt for her balls. 
 nice.  do you remember her? 
 eze:  i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses, but ...  yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever.  also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly.  ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com  ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night? 
 hey greg,  happy new year.  i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france, but i hope things are going well.  i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break - mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations.  where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers?  i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town.  hope you're well and talk to you soon, cooper 
 hey craig,  happy new year.  thanks for forwarding me this - i'm investigating all career opportunities at the moment.  i hope you've been out skiing the last few days, it looks like its been puking.  i've been sick the last few days :(  first time in a year or so.  had a great break and i'm back taking care of all the little things waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operation.  we'll see ...  hey, do you want to go to stronghold sometime?  be good to catch up.  i don't think i'm going to be healthy this week, but if you're interested next week would work.  i don't know how much time you're spending in calgary these days.  cooper 
 1001 14th Ave SW, apt 303 
 Hey Ethan,  I appreciate the look on this and am interested.  i'm investigating all alternatives and have been considering mainly calgary and portland as options.  it looks like there will be more clarity on the future of enron's trading operation soon, which should help solidify any job decisions.  my latest resume is at home and i will forward it on tomorrow and you can see what the fit is like.  thanks for thinking of me and good luck with the business.  Cooper 
 nerve emailed me back and wants to get together for a drink. 
 yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  i don't really shop for "yoga clothes" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent! 
 the first - just wanted to go thru whatever i was thinking last night.  it's no big deal. 
 i think he would be the jackass we hate at earls.  but, i'm approaching him with the new jordey-inspired don't worry be happy mentality and its working great!  i feel like i didn't get closure last night after seeing the place.  maybe that nook in the main room could be for a computer? 
 have you told nicole about going to yoga tonight?  keep in mind that whatever you tell her seems to go straight to dorland and then i have to deal with it.  now he wants to pull an earls at joey's here downtown. 
 i'm worried the place is too small. 
 you're dumb. 
 i still haven't eaten lunch, so i may take off now and then meet you 
 Stan-  this is being processed and you will be paid soon.  i promise!  Hope you are having a good start to the year.  -Cooper 
 4:30 from your building? 
 we're on for 5:30 
 although i like my yoga naked, i do like to put something on for savasana (corpse pose at the end), which is probly what she's thinking.  the latest in canadian yoga fashion can be found at www.lululemon.com  give me a look on the movie if you end up going and want to see royal t's.  cell is 512 3312. 
 agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i see the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad you briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo.  are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long ago... and i do want to see it.  glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c 
 eze:  hows the new job?  i got your email from jai.  are we on for yoga tomorrow?  thanks for the scooby snacks (tasty) and stickers (plentiful).  normally i suffer some angst from stickers since i don't want to waste them, but you got me so many that it's not an issue.  did you have fun at the crazy horse?  i was quite drunk and unfocused but had a good time.  the edge 
 i called mt royal and tentatively scheduled for tomorrow at 5:30.  left a message at 25th Ave place.  dude, that is faaaaar. 
 i'm leaving now, but why don't you call me on my cell on sunday or i'll call you at home and we can finalize.  -c 
 i only just started playing squash; are you a member at the Y?  do you want to meet around 3:30 or so? 
 yah, maybe start on monday with new listings?  check things out during the week and then massive investigation on the w/e? 
 Greg,  do you know the status of VPN connectivity going forward for UBS employees?  thx, cooper 
 dear elissa-  it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list.  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball.  oops.  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too.  i am still working for Enron, a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently.  things are ok with that for the moment, but i don't really know what's in my future.  probly know more soon.  i live in calgary (did you know?) and have for the last year or so.  i like canada very much.  much more than i expected, although it is very cold here.  mostly the people i like, especially but not limited to all the comely young women.  are you still in NC?  are you going to make Ben a respectable man anytime soon?  i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that, since i do very little all day.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to.  send a note when you get a chance.  also, if you can think of it, reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home.  one big hug, cooper 
 i am playing squash at the Y at 2:30 on sunday, so maybe we could meet after i play and before you play?  i would prefer that to meeting up with you and a friend.  maybe grab some coffee?  i am part of the trading operations, so i would get sold with it and then i would have to decide if i want to be part of whatever the new organization ends up being. 
 do you want to set aside some time this w/e to look at places, or should we wait until next week?  it may be a little late to schedule things.  altho, we should definitely check out that place in kensington. 
 well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i don't work very long days.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.  take care, cooper 
 hey nicki-  i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again.  cooper  p.s. my sister-in-law really liked her sweater and it fit perfectly. 
 $700 seems like plenty.  i know you don't want to be house poor, but i only think it's worth it if we find a sweet place. 
 sweet. 
 it's all about the action. 
 i need to move my dining room table before monday night when a sofa is getting delivered.  can you help me out sometime this w/e?  i also want to show off the scooby phone. 
 it looks like there are alot of places in the herald classifieds.  i need 30 days notice according to my lease.  did you do any thinking about how much you can spend on a pad? 
 my nametag now reads "Mrs Jai Hawker".  in keeping with nickname strategy, i am pretending not to notice. 
 apparently, your invoice has been lost in the system somewhere.  do you have a copy you could send and i will get it processed asap?  thx, cooper 
 can you send eze email then?  not a disaster if you don't come.  based on the way you two got along last night, its probly better if you don't ... 
 for Stan Williams of Williams Project Ltd.  submitted in december and approved by zufferli.  is this one in the pipe as well?  thanks, cooper 
 do you want in on yoga w/ eze?  i'd like to set it up, especially since it may involve jamie, but not sure if you're interested in spending extracurricular time w/ eze 
 Thanks Cheryl. 
 Hey-  i just got back into town from almost 3 weeks vacation.  sorry i didn't get in touch over the holidays, but do you want to get together sometime soon?  my schedule is very easy-going at them moment - hopefully you are in town.  cooper 
 Cheryl,  Nancy Taylor at Cognicase has asked me to check into payments for 2 IT Contractors.  I have the invoices and understand that you have them as well.  It's about 60 grand C$.  Are there any issues surrounding paying them?  thanks, Cooper 
 Stan,  just back in the office and i will get right on it.  Cooper 
 Greg/Dan,  now that things are firming up, can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support (i.e., fundamentals).  the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs1, nacal-sqws001p, nacal-sqws001d and the 3 pizza boxes.  i know there is some shuffling around now, but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term (either estate/ubs share, estate only, or ubs only).  thanks, cooper 
 testing 
 how about mon eve then?  i'm not sure how much time you have - sounds like you still have work to do before going home, but I'm up for anything - dinner or drinks/coffee later on?  or maybe something more seasonal - i don't know if you still have any shopping left, but I always leave it to the last minute and do a horrible job.  i'm running around today but i'll try phoning tonight to see what you think.  cooper 
 yah, it's amazing how quickly christmas sneaks up on me.  i'm hoping i won't have to come into work next week and feeling very good about leaving work for awhile.  almost like being an undergrad at the end of a semester.  so, i'm flying out on wednesday and wondering if you'd like to get together before i go?  i'm more or less free from sunday until i go. coffee sometime?  dinner?  cooper 
 i have enspace up and running - looks like the demo you showed.  unfortunately, i'm taking the rest of the year off, so I won't be around for your startup, but I will look at it first thing in the new year. 
 can you move backups of production AlbertaPower and development AlbertaGas to i:\trading\newco\richey\db\?  thx,  cooper 
 can you add mark dupuy to the "caldata_pwrfund" NT group.  He needs to take over some of Karim's responsibilities.  thx, cooper 
 i think i can get around this, but i need to install some software under local admin.  can you drop by and hook me up when you get a chance? 
 damn!  do you use microsoft outlook?  or some bizarre Corel product?  yes, it would be terrible to allow employees access to a cd-rom drive.  productivity would plummet.  enron let their employees have cd-roms and look what happened to them! 
 I moved the meeting to VC1 for 9:30-10:30 - does that work? 
 great. thanks.  -c 
 IT never got the box up 
 p	50 o	15 
 Chris,   I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.  I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, rather than theirs.  Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the person to talk to about this?  cooper 
 are you around?  can you give me a call?  974 6946  coop 
 hey,  i don't have your phone number at work.  i have some bad news - i'll be flying out 3 days later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight! i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little, which is good.  by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present. a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.  number here is 403 974 6946 if you want to chat.  love, coop 
 wanted to send you a reference to my dream girl  http://www.ecologyproject.org/staff.html  scroll down to the julie osborn section  i used to work with her in berkeley 
 everything look ok?  does the enron direct data look correct?

   hey, do you see graphics above this sentence?  the admins showed me how to insert clip art into email and i'm trying to figure out if works outside of enron.  <Embedded Microsoft Clip Gallery> <Embedded Microsoft Clip Gallery> 
 hey!  sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving in october!?!, but some friends had me over for "american" thanksgiving, so i had a good time anyway.  i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  let me know about your holiday plans!  love, coop 
 just use same as yesterday 
 what's your number over there? 
 p	38 o	15 
 yah - didn't feel like talking to you.  felt like a pawn on your wheelin' chicks chessboard yesterday.  we should talk later - don't want to get into it over email or on the phone. 
 i don't know what you mean.  i'm just a dumb trader  it's called double mo cafe.  go to www.doublemo.cafe 
 in case you didn't get this 
 try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #? 
 Hey Tim,  not sure what you guys are up to, likely making yourself pretty for potential investors?  we're not quite at that point yet here, so things are very slow which has given me some time to look into R (been on my list for quite some time).  It looks very good!  have you had a chance to look into it?  i'd like to verify that it's worth putting some time into.  hope things are going well and i'll give a call to chat sometime soon.  cooper 
 call me when you have a chance, something i want to share 
 i'm tired today.  good night at earl's last night! your aggro-ness finally paid some fucking dividends 
 bitch - you have to let me see them! 
 sweet.  glad to hear things are going so well.  yeah, things are ok here.  it's more boring than anything.  not sure what the future holds ... 
 i'm out. strings should put them on ebay. 
 the burden of proof rests on your shoulders 
 i'll just need a receipt and you're done 
 you're done on the 85% discount ? 
 9 
 sounds good. 
 i'd have to see them and they'd have to fit my shoes, but as long as the discount is in the 85-90% range, i'm cool with it. 
 sweet!  yah, jimi told me about the party and i will definitely be there.  i'm not happy about you deploying though dude.  do you know what your role will be?  definitely catch up when i'm back.

 IT has to hook up unreal because it requires local admin rights.  also, we don't have the disk anymore since colin left, so don't think we hook up anymore.  unfortunately.  marks on the way 
 greg,  i wanted to run the curve fetcher for the last few days.  i booted up the app, but it looks like i need to setup a db connection.  can you send me the steps i need to run for the last few days.  thx, coop 
 Hi,  I'm responding to an email sent by Tim Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a "credit" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the "credit" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  thanks, Cooper Richey 403 974 6946 
 Hi Dawn,  haven't heard from you recently.  have you received anything from houston for me?  thx, cooper 
 hey dude-  what's new?  i'm coming home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you planning on being around?  be great to catch up on life.  i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so - feeling lame and out of touch.  i hear howard is engaged.  things are going well for me, although job situation is somewhat uncertain at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.  how's callisma and life in general?  coop 
 eze:  its going well, thanks for asking - work is good - i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work!  feels good.  and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing - i hope it sticks.  how are things with you - i know you are super busy, but it must be good to finally be starting a career?  rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.  i'm not excited to move at all, but i am looking forward to living in a new spot.  change is good.  i probly won't need your help moving, but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea, so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install.  great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).  hope to see you tonight.  cooper 
 hey dude-  i hear you're engaged!  congratulations.  what's going on?  i haven't been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to catching up ...  coop 
 don't think so.  he's pretty old 
 hey,  can you send me the last few of these?  thx, cooper 
 there's an amazing guitarist playing at the double mo cafe (the one my friend's wife owns) on friday night.  ted williams.  i've seen him before and he's incredible.  i would call him a blues guitarist, but not sure ...  i think it starts at 9.  is strings interested? 
 p	45 o	15 
 no relation  that clip isn't the full one though. 
 any interest in a chapter's visit sometime soon? 
 not really.  i'm sure you've already been labeled a playboy (i feel you playboy!)  it depends how superficial and silly the men are there - my sense is that they aren't, but i don't know. 
 definitely - i'm glad you want to talk more about it.  are you going to be downtown this week at all?  should know more on wed/thu in terms of enron canada's future. 
 definitely!  what more could you ask for? 
 hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three neurons firing in my brain this morning...  i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every day.  let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in.  i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small town!  hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?  cooper

 andrea.langfeldt@enron.com 
 got the fax.  it looks like i made it in microsoft word!  :)  shouldn't need the hardcopies.  thanks.  will keep you in the loop on things.  love, coop 
 sounds good to me. 
 p	55.75 o	16 
 i guess not.  i'll remove the C++ 
  if there's anything you want me to change (technologies to add, things to highlight), let me know 
 Hi,  I graduated in 1996 and need a copy of my degree as part of the application process for a visa in Canada.  Can you point me in the right direction for this?  thanks, Cooper 
 don't do that to me 
 Hey Mom,  Enron just cut to junk status -- very bad for the company.  thought i would give a call but don't have your number at work.  send it if you get a chance.  love, coop 
 cell number is:  512 3312 but it's enron's phone, so ...  home number is 262 0205 and cooper@llamacom.com should be a good place to reach me.  as for me, i'm very unsure.  I'm still technically a U.S. employee and my visa expires soon, so I really don't have any idea.  worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later ... :)  cooper 
 Hi Chris,  I don't know where you're at with things ...  i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one.  please keep this to yourself as I don't feel this way about many people here ...  cheers :)  Cooper 
 looks like i'll be free for lunch ... any interest? 
 you're dumb 
 bitch - you'll get your 20 bones when i get a card with my name on it. 
 no problems here.  everything is fine. 
 i'll be in this powerpool meeting from 9:30 to 2:00 
 you're dumb 
 p	42 o	16 
 don't worry i'm certainly not blaming you for any of this. i have a short fuse when it comes to Houston IT. 
 there is a market surveillance summary for the alberta power pool  at www.powerpool.ab.ca	with some spark spread stuff in it.  didn't look at it, but if you're still looking at spark spreads, it would validate your method. 
 yah.  the brutal part is that i'm sure those planes are no where near full. 
 i missed it that. 
 looks like its 2 Gs to go to kansas city or st louis.  too far to miami, etc. 
 gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head to banff.  alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  have fun in mejico. 
 done. 
 can you come over when its convenient? 
 excellent - really looking forward to dinner tomorrow! 
 DBD::ODBC works like a charm.  if you're already using DBI, i don't think you'll have much trouble with the transition, assuming you're doing anything funky. 
 Hey Greg,  sorry to hear you're sick.  hope you feel better soon.  what will be involved in handing over the development of the client piece (excel, etc.) of the eol feed to colin?  i'd like to get this done as soon as possible.  Cooper 
 looks good.  i'm working some stuff now that is writing to the z:\ drive for publishing on the web -- i will have it write to i: and set it up so it will be easy to change from now going forward.  should be able to tell if it works from that.  i think your idea was a good one. 
 thanks 
 ian -  do you by chance have emily's (from earls) email address?  she gave it to hawker and he lost it.  no prob if you don't. 
 Chris,  can you roll this when you get a chance?  thx, cooper 
 how do you feel about a matinee, bitch? 
 the colonel was talking about meeting at Lucky's on 17th and then head out.  perhaps to the backalley.  not a house party at all. 
 Hey Karl!  great to hear from you.  someday we will talk - maybe today?  not sure if you're still in, but i'm at my desk.  number is 403 974 6946 i believe it is the same country code as US, but not sure.  it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better, i'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse.  it was very dicey for awhile - thought ene was going tits up.  spanish desk sounds great!  say hi to kristian and paul for me, but we should catch up by phone, if possible, so i'll leave it there.  cooper  p.s. snow is just falling on the mountains and i'm getting excited for some good skiing. 
 definitely.  sounds fun. 
 nope.  maybe ask greg or sebastien. 
 Hey Toby,  sorry to hear about the layoffs.  i think the hatchet falls around here next week.  Chris Wiebe has been taking care of things here and interacting with Houston a fair bit and I think he's been doing a great job with things, which is too bad since that means he forces me to play around in dev instead of prod ...  anyway, i hope we can enjoy a beer sometime and laugh about enron, but it doesn't feel too good right now.  thanks for the note. 
 its a boring exchange - its hard to get motivated.  i thought i would be on the one a day plan  bitch, i could barely open the doors on the way back. 
 Hi Kate,  sorry for not leaving my numbers.  they are:  (h)	403 262 0205 (w)	403 974 6946 (c)	403 512 3312  hope you have a great thanksgiving and can't wait to catch up.  love, coop 
 hey japhet  did i ever get you the name of the wind guy at enron?  i forget now. 
 ok.  by the way, there is no model.  i just pull these numbers out of the air.  thu p	30 o	20  fri p	30 o	20  sat p	28 o	20  sun p	28 o	20  mon p	45 o	20

 any interest in going to vegas end of feb? 
 i'm flexible, but i'm guessing it will be more crowded then.  y? 
 probly around 2 or after work around 4:30. 
 Hey Greg,  just wanted to verify that the address i gave you before was correct.  thx for the hookup!  - c - 
 Hi Cheryl,  I'm not sure if I forwarded this or not, but I'm not sure what to do with this.  This is regarding the invoice I gave you a couple weeks ago.  It appears that Stan submitted two invoiced on the same day?  Let me know if there is anything I can do.  Cooper 
 eze-  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight.  i went to core last night and it was nice and mellow.  do you have any idea who teaches the 7:30 class?  i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy taught the class and it wasn't so good - adding that to the rockne risk makes it a dangerious proposition.  do you happen to have janice's email address?  jai and i haven't been to earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing.  if you see her when you're working, tell her i said hi.  - c - 
 looks like $35 plus surcharges. 
 did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about.  my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys.  just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too?  i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.  - c - 
 hitting the send button at most once a day would be a start. 
 it says its general admission, are there no seat assignments?  do you want to go sat or sun? 
 do you remember tom cruise in vanilla?  how he was a "satisfaction delayer"?  you are the fucking polar opposite.  you've been waiting 2 years, don't you want to kick back and enjoy the ride in? 
 dude.  you're over-reacting.  i think she was flustered by your voracious flirting and pulled the chute.  i hope kryptonomicon isn't this boring in real life.  dude, are we done on nelly? 
 1) 
 fyi sofa delievered sometime between 10 and 2 on sat. 
 are you talking about the sweatbands in there?  those are sweet.  are you ordering anything from there? 
 are you fucking kidding me?  i'm always right, baby. 
 consider me a free call option 
 here's the address in case you need it for something:  303 1001 14th Ave SW Calgary AB T2R1L2 
 can you ask your mom the name of the upholstery store she recommended to me before xmas?  thx 
 can you send rene's number -- need to get the postal code to get sofa delivered. 
 eze:  hows it going?  jai said you got into an accident - glad to hear you are ok and i hope it wasn't too stressful.  thinking of going to yoga tonight at the space (5:30) - thought i would give you a look.  have you been going to yoga?  i haven't since i've been sick :(  - c - 
 ok, fuckface. 
 brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.  the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least.  the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.  asking for props?  please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established.  don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer inside - that tinge of guilt?  that's what i'm talking about.  in any case, i don't plan on claiming anyone again. 
 some other time then 
 that's even worse, stratego 
 nice work getting her email address, bitch 
 i think she said "going steady" 
 excellent - although krypto has a good chance of morphing into "lex luther" at some later point 
 Gary,  I seem to have the wrong email address - please forward this on.  thx, cooper 
 Hi,  I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a "junior power risk management" position at Epcor onto you.  Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.  Regards, Cooper Richey    Michael Wong mfwong@ualberta.net 403.560.0289 
 I believe it is 1001 14th Ave, apt #303 - but i'm waiting for verification.  sorry for the delay.  you can give them my cell # 262 0205.  afternoons work best starting this friday for installation.  thanks.  oh, can you send me the name of that attorney you mentioned?  thx, cooper 
 Hi Jill,  how was ceili's?  i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black hawk down.  i think i was in bed by 10:30...  i'm sure you had more fun than me.  overall, my w/e was fairly uneventful. you?  should go another time.  cooper 
 Dawn, updated resume is attached - let me know if you need anything else.  Cooper 
 button-  thanks for the hockey tickets - my second NHL game!  it was sweet - started out great with a fight and a goal and then not much happened.  see ya around, cooper 
 hi Jill,  i'm glad you had fun last night and we should definitely do it again.  I may stop by ceili's on the way home, but might also go home to bed.  undecided at the moment.  if i don't stop by, can i take a raincheck?  i'm sure i'll see you soon either way.  Cooper 
 well, after your pep talk this morning ... it's worth checking out for sure. 
 i really don't want to go out, but think i should at least stop by. 
 want to go? 
 3 to 1 - the games were close, but carlos controlled the match. 
 carl beat cowan  how was the maid? 
 Dawn,  I think I may be on an "immigration" list in houston, but based on the attached forms, it looks like they think i am a non-U.S. citizen residing in the U.S., rather than a U.S. citizen residing in Canada.  Should I get in touch with Karen Buckley?  please advise.  Cooper 
 be still my heart 
 eze:  its at 7:30 and its usually $20.  all the money gets spent on the wine, so its a good deal.  its extremely casual and it would be great to see jill again. as for jamie, brokering is a slimy business and its hard to see how she fits in, but then i don't know her that well.  didn't see royal t's... i went home and went to bed (i'm sick! yuck).  dorland is chris dorland and a guy i sit next to at work.  he was there on saturday night.  i'm sure you'll run into him again.  i'll let craig know you are thinking of coming.  - c - 
 Many thanks.  Your copy works like a charm.  I'll be more diligent in my archive search next time. 
 All:  I'm attempting to use lattice on windows 2000 under R 1.4.  Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke "xyplot" or "trellis.device" commands (including the oft-used "quakes" example)  In particular, I get a message box from the windows OS with the following text: -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart the program.  An error log is being generated --------------------------------------------------------------------  this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned.  I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5  am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?  thanks any help, Cooper 
 Hi Chris,  I'm deeply concerned about all of these points and think we should meet in person to discuss.  I'm free all day. 
 hey emily,  don't think i can make yoga tonight - i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days.  however, i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight - so here's a look if you haven't already seen it.  and to respond to your earlier email (i can't keep up): the meeting i had on sunday was fine - it's always good to see what else is out there.  the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating - i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake.  and speaking of earls desserts, anything would be better than the gingerbread cake.  also, has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu, specifically the "featured ingredients" section?  not sure when you're going to get this, actually.  oh, i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested.  do you interested in wine?  my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university.  i always have fun when i go, so give it some thought if you like wine.  i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme.  - c - 
 today is the day 
 hey jon,  i didn't get around to calling you this weekend, but am hoping to touch base this week.  ok to give a call in the evenings?  i'm beginning to think about this as a long term project and look forward to hearing your thoughts.  coop 
 thanks 
 hey mike -  hope you are doing well.  i was talking to a guy over at epcor and he said that they were interested in hiring a "junior" power risk management person and i wanted to see if you want me to pass your contact information along.  cooper 
 i got an error message when i tried to open your message with mike's contact info. 
 address as i deleted your last email.  can you send the name of the movers you used if its handy?  or the realtors name?  thx, cooper 
 no 
 which one was sandy?  is the machination mad at someone else for being selfish and calculating? 
 at some point, you will stop demonizing emily and re-realize how cool she is, bitch.  here's your chance to get out with your rep intact, you can blame everything on the "complexity"  i would make it clean though, none of your half-assed bullshit. 
 hi jill,  ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  talk to you soon, cooper 
 eze:  are you in the office today?  yoga tomorrow sounds great.  i went last night to a beginner YIM class with a friend from work who wanted to check it out.  it was crowded - are the w/e classes the same/better/worse?  i somehow always try to show up early to yoga but never manage to, but YIM may leave me no choice.  i feel like i'm in san francisco three years ago the way yoga is taking off here.  i love carrot cake.  ceilis sounds good - i'll see you there.  i like how you send each email with a takeaway thought.  i'm actually busy this morning, but wanted to reply sorry for the sound bites -- see you after work.  - c -

 i missed yoga last night too - do you want to try to YIM this weekend?  saturday night sounds good.  i'm not sure what's going on with crantina and its not too personal nor a secret.  i'll pass the book along to jai.  are you working at earls again this w/e to support your shooter-lifestyle?  - c -

 you hooked me up on "NACAL-SQWS001D"? 
 does it take awhile for my access to NACAL-SQWS001D to take effect? 
 i've been playing around more with R (doing some reading and installing the basic package) and it looks fantastic.  in particular, the database connecticity package ("RODBC") works right out of the box!  very impressive.  in a couple of lines, i can get data from a table in a SQL server database into a dataframe and more importantly, result sets from stored procedures can be returned to data frames as well.  and its free! 
 hi mom,  i'll let you know when i get the package - thanks for sending it.  things are ok, just waiting to see how things shake out with the enron-ubs deal., it looks ok, but i'll know more later this week.  love, coop
