 Ruth, Call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Theresa 
 Ruth, Here is an estimated November purchase.  Crestone won't have final measurement until next week.  Call me if you have any questions.  Theresa 
 Megan,  Congratulations on your new job!  I certainly understand you leaving.  I really enjoyed working with you and I'll hate to see you go (At least before the rest of us get let go).  Amy was let go last Friday here along with another guy.  It's only Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself left.  I am working on the November producers today as a matter of fact.  I am hoping to complete them today or tomorrow morning.  I have a walk through on my new house tomorrow afternoon and could possibly be moving on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it'll be next Thursday.  I wanted to get all of this out of the way before my move.  I'll get busy now and hopefully email you later today.  Thanks, Theresa 
 The only thing I'd like to add is the Quantum purchase for November is 1,000 Mcf not MMBtu.  We are showing a 967 btu factor so it would be 967 MMBtu at the wellhead less fuel.  Any additional gas would be under imbalance between Crestone and Quantum.  Thanks. Theresa 
 My husband Jeff and I are planning on attending.  Do you know if we are getting any special rates at any hotels downtown for that night?  Let me know.  Thanks, Theresa Staab 
 That was quick!.  You can bring it to work and we could meet for lunch one day.  Let me know which day is good for you.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Barry, The phone system seems to be down, so I'm e-mailing you to let you know that I've gone home for the day.   I will bring the pillow back tomorrow and get with you then.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Heidi, Since I have yet to use the gym this year - I think I'll finally get smart and q	uit paying for it.  Count me out for this round.  Theresa 
 Gloria, Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.  Let me know , Theresa 
 I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 and how might you want to be involved??? 
 What did you need to do to finish 8/01?  We have about cleared the interconnect issue for 9/01.  Theresa 
  Kim, Here's the PSCO website address.  http://www.ncenergies.com/WebEbb/html/GasIndex.asp  Let me know if you have more questions.  Things are crazy for sure!  We are down to 3 employees here in Denver.  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself.  Talk to you soon, Theresa 
 Gee Thanks Barry!!  You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's
