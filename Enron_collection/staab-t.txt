 Ruth, Call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Theresa 
 Ruth, Here is an estimated November purchase.  Crestone won't have final measurement until next week.  Call me if you have any questions.  Theresa 
 Megan,  Congratulations on your new job!  I certainly understand you leaving.  I really enjoyed working with you and I'll hate to see you go (At least before the rest of us get let go).  Amy was let go last Friday here along with another guy.  It's only Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself left.  I am working on the November producers today as a matter of fact.  I am hoping to complete them today or tomorrow morning.  I have a walk through on my new house tomorrow afternoon and could possibly be moving on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it'll be next Thursday.  I wanted to get all of this out of the way before my move.  I'll get busy now and hopefully email you later today.  Thanks, Theresa 
 The only thing I'd like to add is the Quantum purchase for November is 1,000 Mcf not MMBtu.  We are showing a 967 btu factor so it would be 967 MMBtu at the wellhead less fuel.  Any additional gas would be under imbalance between Crestone and Quantum.  Thanks. Theresa 
 My husband Jeff and I are planning on attending.  Do you know if we are getting any special rates at any hotels downtown for that night?  Let me know.  Thanks, Theresa Staab 
 That was quick!.  You can bring it to work and we could meet for lunch one day.  Let me know which day is good for you.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Barry, The phone system seems to be down, so I'm e-mailing you to let you know that I've gone home for the day.   I will bring the pillow back tomorrow and get with you then.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Heidi, Since I have yet to use the gym this year - I think I'll finally get smart and q	uit paying for it.  Count me out for this round.  Theresa 
 Gloria, Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.  Let me know , Theresa 
 I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 and how might you want to be involved??? 
 What did you need to do to finish 8/01?  We have about cleared the interconnect issue for 9/01.  Theresa 
  Kim, Here's the PSCO website address.  http://www.ncenergies.com/WebEbb/html/GasIndex.asp  Let me know if you have more questions.  Things are crazy for sure!  We are down to 3 employees here in Denver.  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself.  Talk to you soon, Theresa 
 Gee Thanks Barry!!  You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again.  The Bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in Green Bay I would really bet on the Packers but I'm just gonna hope they can beat them in Chicago.  I hope we'll get the game here in Denver.  GO PACK GO........  Do you care to wager anything? 
 The deal was nominated and cut to zero. 
 Amy, I just now opened my e-mail (7:30)  - I've been trying to figure out where you were because I saw the capacity reports and the Gas Daily.  I thought you left to go get breakfast.  DARN!.  I hope you feel better.   I wouldn't worry about coming in today.  Ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway.  See you tomorrow.  Theresa 
 FYI - Medicine Bow incremental Firm Capacity effective 11/12/01 is up to 4530 from 3410.  As far as the maintenance tomorrow, Adele said they won't decide on cuts until after 1st cycle and then the cuts will be based on nominations.  I'll let you know after lunch.  Theresa 
 Rita,  Scott Sitter (Crestone) and I have been working on this.  Scott has been trying to reconcile with FUGG on the 12/99 - 10/00 imbalances, then we can take it from there.  I forwarded this e-mail to Scott to see when we can get together to finalize this.  I will get you a complete summary with all the backup as soon as I can.  (My guess is the last week of November - 1st week of December.  Scott is out most of this week on vacation and I'm out next week.)  I'll talk to you soon. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Theresa (303) 575-6485 
 Gloria, I was looking at Path Manager and it doesn't look to me like they even pathed this CAN point.  Let me know what you find out - Mark Bergeron at Woodward is expecting a call back from us (Paul Lucci) today. Thanks.  Theresa.  (The invoice they received must be based on nominations - right?) 
 I think we could probably do +.025 (we bid +.03 last month and I think he said .025 won.)  What do you think? 
 ENA will bid CIG Gas Daily +.02 for the Lost Creek Fuel Volume ( 500 - 1000)  Thanks, Theresa Staab 
 Gloria, Is there any way you could copy and send overnight to me the CIG invoices for the 33175000 contract from May, 2000 through January, 2001?  I am helping Darla and Megan reconcile the Citizens account.  It is changing over to Kinder Morgan effective Dec. 1 and we need to reconcile this account rather quickly.  I printed all other invoices on the Internet from CIG's website but they only go back 9 months.  Let me know if this is possible or where else I might find these.  Thanks, Theresa 
 It's 10:10 our time and I didn't see the fax yet.  I wasn't sure what time you sent it.  I have to take the kids to finish our shopping for the kids name drawing and we'll be done too.  We got Sierra an outfit from Old Navy - and I think she'll like it.  Talk to you soon. 
 Megan, Here are the producers for November for the Powder River system.  I don't have Lost Creek yet - hopefully before you leave.  Please call me if you see any problems.  There will be no sales invoice this month for Crestone and I've told this to Scott Dozier.  I will get the gathering to Gloria tomorrow.  Thanks again,  Theresa  (P.S. - you'll have to give me your new # so we can keep in touch) 
 I didn't see the attachment. 
 That's still not that great is it? 
 It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet.  Are you out any time from now until the end of the month? 
 I'll have Amy watch for it for me and get it over to Craig Lipke if it comes in while I'm gone.  I will be out starting tomorrow until Wed. the 28th.  If I don't talk to you before then - Happy Thanksgiving!  I hope you have a great one.  Theresa 
 Megan, I'm a little to quick for myself.  I needed to add the $15,000 facility fee to Independent.  Here's the new one.  Thanks, Theresa 
 Megan, Try this for Phillips.  Thanks, Theresa 
   I wasn't sure that you received the first e-mail.  Theresa 
 Mark, Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Theresa (303) 575-6485 
 Susan, Attached is an invoice which needs to be paid by 01/02/02.  Thanks.    I will fax the invoice to you today.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need additional information.  Thanks, Theresa Staab (303) 575-6485 Office (303) 807-6131 Cell 
 I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a "paid invoices" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
