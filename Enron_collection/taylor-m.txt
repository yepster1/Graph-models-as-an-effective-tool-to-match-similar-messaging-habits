 In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:  The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911. These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code." From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code). From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code). I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.  It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.  Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459

 Nobody won on Wednesday so the jackpot is up to $33 million.  I'll get us some tickets for tomorrow's drawing.

 Thanks Sami.  It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.  It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.  Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out. 
 Joel:  Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?  Mark 
 Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.  Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

 David,  Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.  I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.  I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.  Mark 
 OK by me. 
 Do you have time to work on this? 
 I'll be there.  Large/0413/105657 
 Thanks Suzanne.  I'll take care of it and give RBS a call tomorrow.  Mark 
 EOL67313 WELCOME! 
 Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.  Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:  1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow? 2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power? 3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise? 4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements? 5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?  Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!  Mark

 Thanks for taking this one. 
 Sara:  How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.  Sorry for rambling.  Mark 
 FYI  Looks like we may get free passes to the boat show!

 Frank Sayre will be working on this matter while Cheryl is on vacation. 
 Sara:  I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  Scary, hunh?  Mark 
 FYI 
 I hope it was ok to respond to this - because I did. 
 I'm afraid I have a conflict that day. 
 Sure. 
 I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.  If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft. I'll let you know if it gets to that.  Otherwise I think we're under control.  Mark 
 Please arrange this for me. 
 I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.) 
 Since they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.  Tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for. 
 Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market. 
 Can you help Bryant with this?  Mary and Sara are both out tomorrow, Brent is supposed to get the form for the Commodity Logic matters finished and Francisco can't really take anything new until Monday.  I don't think Anne and Barbara have enough ISDA experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly.  If you are swamped, maybe you can get this started (I doubt if they even have credit approval yet) and somebody else can take it over next week. 
 This wasn't on my calendar - were you aware? 
  This one has sound so be careful..... 
 I have forwarded these on to Chris Long (who will get back to me on Monday) and left a message for Ken to let him know I will send it on to him as soon as Chris signs off. 
 Any idea where this stands?

 It appears this was handled by the Calgary office.  Greg Johnston will give you a call. 
 That's what I'm hoping, but if not Barbara said she would work on it. 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure which version this is but you'll no doubt be revising anyway. 
 Anne Koehler is probably the best person to talk to.  She has indicated she will have some time in the morning. 
 We've actually completed this as far as I know -- negotiated the agreement and signed it last week.

 yes 
 Do I have the receipts for these? 
 I have a friend who is an allergist but I'm not sure he's any good. If nobody else comes up with a suggestion I will be happy to give you his name. 
 OK by me. 
 To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, Tana can probably help. 
 I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.

 My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:   Bistro Mezzaluna Armadillo Cafe (Davie) Left Bank Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs) Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)  Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.

 I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.  Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places? 
   Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I was going through some old e-mails and found this one - is this something you have already handled? 
 Hi George.  I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  I was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read.  I'm living in Houston these days.  I was actually in London on 9/11.  My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.  I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.  I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.  Mark K. is in NYC.  I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.  I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.  I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  Hope you guys are doing well.  Mark 
 I agree with Susan that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in NYC and Houston that the ENA ISDA should be used.  Ms. Zivic had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people). 
 I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences. 
 Since I have to attend the Enron Net Works staff meetings Thursdays at noon, might it be possible to pick a different day? 
 Are you still taking care of the Portland guys?  Do you have time to look at this? 
 As long as this remains an internal only document, I do not have any problems with it. 
 Let's get together with Sara and Mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms. 
 I don't see why not. 
 Please see me before responding to Alan.  Thanks,  Mark 
 This is a swap confirm.  Do you have an option? 
 Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex. 
 I got another one. 
 Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours? 
 And another..... 
 Please check your records and make sure your e-mails intended for me are addressed to the correct Mark Taylor.  There are two of us here at Enron and the other Mark is getting some of your EOL approvals e-mails. 
 Stacey,  Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:  1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.) 2.  German Energy Markets 3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms  There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:  Christophe's panel discussion on new markets E-commerce panel  I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda. 
 The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the making of reservations for reward travel. 
 approved 
 Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:  Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?" 
 I spoke with Joe Collins (see below) this morning.  They are definitely thinking about the Commodity Exchange Act implications.  They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.  I gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction.

I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.  Mark

   February/March 2001 Issue  Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadb= and has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditisi= ng this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, p= urchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to= Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts we= re based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liqui= dated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from bei= ng a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from= a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of= contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingha= m, a senior trader at Enron. "When we sell the product to the customer we r= emain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind the= ir position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storag= e market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm del= ivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant develo= pment. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour di= scounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm deli= very," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participa= nts are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment = vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equip= ment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development o= pens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.   =09 
   Broadband Networking News  Mark Holmes 03/27/2001  Enron Hits Back Q= uickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications co= nglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electro= nics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid = to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entert= ain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electro= nics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental t= o Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enro= n after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announ= ced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies= for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yield= ed the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this excit= ing new on-demand service," explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of = Enron Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing,= but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtua= lly complete," notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warb= urg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of it= ems to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving tr= affic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly fr= om the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I woul= d suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggre= ssive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure o= f the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year = agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery= business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron= ," Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tell= s Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two a= nchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Elec= tronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the= importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network.= Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived f= rom its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to pro= vide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, a= llowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom= business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into= most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the conten= t delivery business will be successful," says Ray Niles, a utilities equity= analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The fact of the matter is they did get a= nother deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get = another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earni= ngs forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not ver= y successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast= for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is the= ir competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (f= rom Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yan= nello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It i= s disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other= deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably= the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  Enron, whi= ch produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various business= es, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbust= er deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannell= o says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $2= 5 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has ha= ppened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Block= buster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we= expand that $25 telecom valuation."   =09

 Chris - any chance you can show what the specific changes are? 
 I got your message and the e-mail.  I'll be happy to go pick them up.  Once I have them I'll let you know and we can arrange for you to get them. 
 Is there a call-in number for this meeting?  (I'll be in NYC.) 
 FYI 
 It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much= trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per = hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water go= t so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to= get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It= looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab si= nce some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the d= oor sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in bi= g trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I w= ould have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the seco= nd floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did com= e inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water= inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midni= ght the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no= standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all g= one.  Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the lo= op) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up = to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear = that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. = You missed a big one!

 Just wanted to let you know that I plan on attending the June 25 meeting along with Jonathan Marsh and perhaps one or two others from Enron. 
 I have your travelers Checks.  Are you mobile yet? 
 I have to agree.  It sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation.  If we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here, we should be willing to pay SOME kind of premium, even if it is fairly small. 
 I'm happy to take a look at the proposed language and coordinate with the lawyers in London and Singapore.  The difficulty in making the Long Description language the same around the world is that the underlying GTC's are necessarily different because they are governed by different laws.  We'll see what we can do. 
 Hope you had a good vacation.  Thanks for forwarding all of my mail.  Now that I've been migrated to Outlook it may actually get worse instead of better.  My assistant is trying to see if there isn't something the IT people can do. 
 FYI 
 While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance:  EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - Barbara Gray (x36832) Private e-marketplaces - Anne Koehler (x33488) Commodity Logic and hub issues - Mark Greenberg (x58897)  Tana Jones (x33399) may also be able to answer some questions, particularly relating to EnronOnline counterparty approvals, and is pretty good at tracking down the appropriate lawyer if you can't.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I have inserted my changes below. 
 I have left a lengthy voicemail for you with my comments -- the comments aren't that lengthy, just the voicemail.  Please call if you have any questions:  713-853-7459 - office 713-863-7190 - home 713-206-8080 - cell  or page me at 1-877-855-2081 
 Louise Kitchen has asked to be included and receive copies of our answers. 
 I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."  My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong? 
 I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there.  I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon.  I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them.  Don't worry if that's not possible.  I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock.  Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.? 
 If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers. 
 Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.  We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.  Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.  Mark  P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us. 
 We agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the EOL people to make sure that it works on the system.  I haven't heard back. 
 Dale -  I know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals.  We have asked Stephanie Panus, one of the other paralegals in the group, to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along.  Tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and I am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week.  Mark 
 Yes, I was working with Justin Boyd and Ian Brungs in the legal dept. I think they sent the revisions to Arfan. 
 Since we are not an FCM or an IB, I think we can let this one go. 
 looks fine to me 
 Rats - I thought I had picked a day when we were all going to be here - your day off was not listed on my group calendar.  Sorry! 
 Thanks Chris.  I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.  Bottom line, I don't think we will be advocating the MFA position. 
 Kelly:  Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:  Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.  The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.  I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.  On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!  I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.  Mark 
 I will not be able to attend. 
 We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  Janet Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions. 
 We should talk about this when you have a minute. 
 Requirements for Electronic Trading Facilities for Exempt Commodities  Transactions must be principal to principal (no brokers)  Parties must be Eligible Commercial Entities Same as Eligible Contract Participants ($10 mil. total assets or $1 mil. net worth) except: Must: have demonstrable ability to make or take delivery of the underlying commodity, or incur risks, in addition to price risk, related to the commodity, or be a dealer May not be a(n): investment company commodity pool employee benefit plan individual  The facility must: Register with the CFTC giving: Name, address, person to receive notices Commodity categories to be traded Certifications that: Executives meet certain qualifications The facility will comply with exemption conditions The facility will notify the CFTC of any changes in information provided Identity of any clearing organizations to be used Give the CFTC access to trading protocols and electronic access to the system Provide reports to the CFTC regarding executed transactions as requested by the CFTC Maintain records of all transactions and participants for 5 years and give the CFTC access to the records Publicly disseminate price, trading volume and other trading data as required by the CFTC On special request, deliver to the CFTC such other information as it may request  Transactions on such facilities are subject to the anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation jurisdiction of the CFTC 
 This is fine with me.  In the past, Dave wanted to see all of the ETA and PA amendments that we negotiated with EnronOnline users.  I take it these should go to you now.  If it comes to you from me, Leslie Hansen or Mark Greenberg, you can assume that Legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval.  Let us know if you no longer want to receive these. 
 Could one of you please take a look at the red-lined language in the attachment and let me know if it is ok to approve it.  Thanks! 
 I'm coming to New York this weekend and will be there until Tuesday.  Any chance we could get together for a drink while I'm in town?  Mark 
 FYI 
 Thanks -- I agree. 
 I have the pager with me but don't know if it's working.  Would you mind sending a test message?  Did you set up a lunch for me for tomorrow with David Mitchell?  It isn't on my calendar - or at least not the calendar I can access from the road.  Hope you had a good weekend!  Mark 
 Everyone I've talked to was thoroughly impressed.  I'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from Cheryl on Friday indicating she wanted to talk about it...not sure yet what that means.  I'm out of town today and tomorrow - if you have time to stop by Cheryl's office & ask, that might help.  My only concern with Kim at all is that she probably can't start until September.  Probably worth the wait though. 
 This is a test e-mail page. 
 Here is the list of the counterparties they want to put these agreements in place with and the lawyers that have been assigned to them.  As you can see there are a number that have yet to be assigned.  Would you please pass these out equitably among yourself, Frank, Mary and Francisco -- particularly those in town next week who will have a chance to move them forward.  Kim Theriot is very anxious that we make headway on these.  The counterparties marked with an asterisk are the most urgent.  I will forward the docs I have received from Stacy and Janet as separate e-mails.  Thanks!  Mark    Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I will be happy to attend. 
 I'm afraid I will have to be on the phone for this one. 
 Using your numbers: 1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to. 2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets. 3. Yes 4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules. 
 David -  Apologies for my silence.  I need to check with Mark H. and make sure he is still on board but I think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and schedule something for early September.  Mark 
 FYI 
 No problem. 
 This looks ok to me but I thought I should run it by you first.  Any objections? 
 As per my voice mail. 
 FYI - I will stick my head in today. 
 I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.  The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!  They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 looks good to me - do I need to approve this in the system? 
 Let's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can - that may not be until September but if she can make it sooner that would be great. 
 Here is the first of the no more confirms agreements.  Can you please handle this one?  Even though it came to me over two weeks ago I didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and EOL people called asking for it (entirely my fault) so there is a certain urgency to it.  I also have counterparties for Francisco, Sara and Frank to get started on, but I thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues. 
  Here is the Aquilla no-more-confirms agreement. 
 Have we been officially sanctioned by the LME?  If so, please send me a copy of any official statements of sanction. Depending on exactly what they say, we may have to report the situation to other exchanges here and possibly the CFTC.  Thanks!  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Here is the no-more-confirms document I mentioned. 
  here it is 
 Here is the first of the no-more-confirms agreements.  Power and Gas have already made their changes to the form so now it's our turn.  Sara, Mary and Francisco also have counterparties they are working on.

  FYI 
 Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.  At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.  I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.  The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable. 
 I asked for a return date for you of September 12 which is the day I'm coming back.  But since I will be going to Houston and you will be going to NYC we won't be traveling together anyway.  Would you rather stay an extra day or two? 
 Will you guys be around the first weekend in August?  I have to be in nyc the 1st & 2nd on business - thought I'd check and see what you were up to.  Mark  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Here are my comments: 
 Better check with Stacy to make sure they are done with this one. 
 Your reservations went through on the card you wanted.  I asked for 9/12 as your return date and 9/26 as Amanda's.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Veronica,  The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.  Mark 
 Let's plan on it.  My only question is whether I'll be able to come on Friday eve. or have to wait until Sat. a.m.  Do you have plans that would make one day better than the other?  I have a 4:00 flight back to Houston on Sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the Newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me. 
 Tom Gros and the Commodity Logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so.  The demos are scheduled for 1:30 to 2:30 and 3:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon in EB5C2.  Please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I already have a meeting scheduled at 11 on Monday. 
  If this doesn't work, I can just send you the three whole presentations.  Let me know.  Mark 
 Unfortunately, it's each one comes from a different presentation -- here are all three: Slide 3 Slide 9 Value Proposition Slide 31 
 Here is the language for the risk control slide.  Sorry I can't send it to you as a slide but what they sent me was actually 31 slides that Ken and I've distilled down to one.   Enron Risk Assessment and Control (RAC)  Market Risk Management Policy approved by Board of Directors Trading Limits Value at Risk daily reports -- stress testing Application of Extreme Value Theory  Credit Risk Management Counterparty credit exposure aggregation and management Counterparty Value at Risk models  Segregation of Duties; Independence of RAC optimizes focus on risk identification and performance measurement 
 I marked my comments on the document and left it in your office.

 ISDA's interview is on Wednesday afternoon.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 How did it go? 
 Our agreements with EnronOnline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties (i.e. non-Enron companies).  We can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products, but can not give the lists to anyone else.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
  FYI 
 We do know which companies use the system.  I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.  My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number. 
 Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get away even close to on time?  Thanks again!  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I'll let you guys decide who takes first crack at this one. 
 A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on. 
 Sure - just send me the numbers -- or maybe a website or two.  We run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time.

 Sorry for the delay.  I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00? 
 Sorry for the delay -- these look fine to me. 
 Can you add yourself to my rolodex? 
 This came from the EOL info web site as it is.  Maybe the PowerPoint experts can go there to get a better version? 
 Do you know anything about this? 
 Joel --  I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you. 
 I've checked with Alan and I think Mike R. is probably the right guy all the way around. 
 Here's another which Janet hasn't seen yet.

 Hi Justin -- I'm afraid I don't really know what this is all about.  It sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing.  Can you fill me in? 
 I think it would be a good idea if you would print these out when you get them and bring them in at some point so we can go over them. 
 Oops.  Sorry, I'll bring them by. 
 That's fine with me - I've booked it.  Just let me know if you need to change the time. 
 Janette -- would you please revise Mark's group list to delete Mark A Taylo= r and add me as Mark E Taylor?  Thanks! 
 Wow -- you must really get in early!  Thanks for forwarding these things.  = I've asked Janette to revise her distribution list.  Mark 
 I think Holly talked the e-mail gods into making the change a month or so a= go.

 Yes, that makes sense to me. 
 Please print these out for me and put them in the Commodity Logic file. 
 Good catch!  I was thinking that Thanksgiving was the 29th -- oops.  I'll get a revised quote.  Any ideas for who wants to go?  This particular boat has three cabins and heads.  If we have another person (Jim?) or couple (the Johns?) we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive.  And if there are even more, we could get a larger boat with four cabins.  We just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved.

 I was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail. All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.  There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.

 I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.  I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:  Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.  Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.  The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:  'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'  If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

 I seem to remember that we talked about you doing Anne's review.  I hope it's not just wishful thinking.  Here is the form for her.    Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I would like to attend. 
 Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?  Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?

 This is the current incarnation of project offline.  They are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of EOL for them.  I think Anne has been the point person for them.  It is not related to the back office deal. 
 Marie -- I'm afraid I don't have anything on physical bandwidth at all.  It might make sense to check with the lawyers in EBS -- I would suggest you start with Cynthia Harkness and Robbi Rossi. 
 1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.  3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them. 
 For future reference, please do not send schedules like this to the entire group.  I'd rather these go out one by one.

 We're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.  I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.  I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time." 
 Are you guys working on this already? 
 I have found a couple of other people who are interested in going, but tonight is Ted's last night in town before moving to Ft. Lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game.  Just let me know.

 I'm in London today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in Houston on Thursday.  Since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.  But if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.

 Are we sending drafts by e-mail?  I can imagine we probably are.  If so, let's run a test by sending a real draft to one of us internally to open and see if there is a metadata problem. 
 Create Limit Order Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.  You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.  *Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.   _____  [m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression. [m2]This is the key! - we are changing our price, not showing their price.

 As we discussed. 
 Fertilizers brochure - final text file 2001  [Cover]  FERTILIZERS  It's time to manage your price risk. Logo [Spread 1] Managing Price Risk For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows. Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products. [Spread 2] Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business  The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure. [Spread 3]  SWAPS  Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed. The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party. [Spread 4]  Swap: Producer example  AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target. [chart 1]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread. ?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.  [Spread 5]  Swap: End-user example  FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales. [chart 2]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia. ?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton. ?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.  [Spread 6]  CAPS & FLOORS  Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential. With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements. [Spread 7]  Cap: End-User example  CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay. To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked. The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton. [chart 3]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:  ?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices. ?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap. ?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock. ?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap. ?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.  [Spread 8]  Floor: Producer example  AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time. To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton). [chart 4]   EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:  ?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices. ?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor. ?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium. ?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium. ?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

 Can you take a quick look at this? 
 FYI 
 One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that in as a "service"? 
 Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees? 
 I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.  I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.  I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.  I'll be in touch.

 I think he's asking the wrong question.  Can you help him out? 
 Would one of you please give me a call in my office.  I can't get through on Stuart's cell.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street - EB3892 Houston, Texas 77008 (713)853-7459 (713)646-3490 (fax) 
 These documents need to have the correct directors names added so they can be signed first thing in the morning. 
 Holly said you had been trying to reach me.  I've tried to call several times but still haven't been able to get through to you on the phone. I tired to send this yesterday but it may not have gotten through. 
 These are the good ones. 
 Just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like I'll be able to make it to NY this weekend as previously planned.  I'll let you know if that changes.  Mark 
 Thanks David -- I appreciate that.  I'm thinking when this all calms down, I'll just take a couple of days off and come up to the city for fun -- not wait for a business trip.  I'll give you a ring if anything really interesting comes up. 
 Yes, we might as well get one. 
 John Lavorato, Mark Haedicke and Mike McConnell 
 That's what he goes by. 
 Thanks for the offer.  At this moment, looks like I'm not going to make it at all, much less tonight.  I'll let you know if that changes, I'm proceeding minute to minute here. 
 Thanks for your message.  Is there a number where I can call you?  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street - EB3892 Houston, Texas 77008 (713)853-7459 (713)646-3490 (fax) 
 Thanks for your note.  We're hanging in there. 
 I can get the NETCO document signed but don't know anything about CGNN.  Who should I give that to? 
 I'm in London.  I had a 2 week vacation planned with Bill in Greece but he is unable to join me so I think we'll do that another time.  Are you in London?  Germany?  If so do you want company?  Call me at 020 7491 7282, suite 18 or 020 7881 500 471 or reply to this e-mail and Mark will get a message to me. 
 I honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed.  I expect these are part of other efforts where I am not on the "need to know" list.  If you know another Enron lawyer involved in those efforts I suggest you try them. 
 Net Works is not a marketing affiliate.  We can make changes if they want us to. 
 Thanks for the note -- not to worry about the music.  I didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway.  Thanks for the thought.  It's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch.  Mark

 Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.  It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.  It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.  Tell Don I said Hi.  Mark 
 I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?  On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.  Mark 
 Please give me a call about this - I'm not sure it makes sense to say that the index varies each day. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am stranded in London and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and I can get a seat.  Looks like that means Sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me, too on Friday night. 
 Sorry about that.  I have been a bit preoccupied.  I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.  It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.  You should have them tomorrow. 
 Here are the documents we discussed.

 I think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for - just be very careful to try and minimize expenses. 
 A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):  1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict? 2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).

 Thanks for that, Tim.  I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the Marshall Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.

 I'm fine.  I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.  Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.  If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.  It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.  Hope you are doing ok through all this.  I'm just sort of numb.  Mark 
 I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.  How do we convince customers to participate? Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.  New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.  Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.   Issues:  Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts. Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate? Might make more sense where no current positions exist.  Contract hurdles:  Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default. Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC. May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).  If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?  It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)  Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

 Adam,  Are you in today or this week?  Mike 
 We had a group meeting this morning.  Pretty interesting! 
 He is looking at it right now.  Oh, by the way, we had a group meeting this morning with George. 
 Maybe we might win then. 
 A few things.  - Mainly next week this floor will not be in high spirits.  The layoffs will be next week.  EGM and EIM will be hit  	  hard - John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks - etc. 
 Paul,  Can we get a breakdown of how much Enron gives to soccer and what does it pay for? 
 Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned "that they are good at being number 2."  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  George did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.  Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM.  Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!

 I think he looked at the preso and maybe 25% of the b-plan.  We did not talk about it, yet.  He said it looked good, but he got bored so he stopped reading.  He may be waiting for you to come back in town to discuss.  I told him you would be back Monday.  That is the latest. 
 I understand.  I am not the one holding you up.  I printed out both documents for him to read.  John doesn't take commands from me.  I will make any revisions he has made on his printed copies tomorrow. 
 I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any. 
 Do you want me to go to this?  I was planning on going.  Lisa called me today. 
 I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  If none are out, I think we should call and tell him. 
 I put it in my original message below.  It is 832-496-0123.  Tom Hartman with San Joaquin Power. I imagine a natural.  Are you going to call him today? 
 Just to keep up good relations.  I told him we would get back with him.  Please let me know if you do not call him. 
 I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting.  The meeting was good. But you will be retired before that program is worth anything as far as a good trading program is concerned.  John, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if John gives me anything to add I will.  I am going home (LA) tomorrow so I might work half a day. 
 John, I got a six hour drive tomorrow, so I was thinking of taking a half day, so I can spend a little more time with my mom.  Any objections?  Your emissions analyst 
 Who says that John Massey is not a nice guy? 
 From what I have heard, this looks pretty good.  But I wonder if paragraph 1(c) is correct.  Is this what was agreed or should this refer to any spread transaction including a NYMEX, COMEX or Platt's price and another price (whether one of those 3 or not)?  And finally, I don't understand the penultimate paragraph at all but since you guys are closer to the discussions it may make sense to you.  Can you guys confirm this with the traders and report our comments and/or agreement to ISDA?  Thanks!  Mark 
 I am doing her thing on Saturday in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Kind of a compromise.  My thing Thursday.  John told me to take off as early as I want tomorrow for the drive.  So I think I shall.  I called my boy at San Joaquin. 
 I told him those ERCs on website were being sold.  We are looking into another deal (bullshit)so we will keep in touch if something comes up.  Price was not brought up. 
 Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

 While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.  I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.  If so, you may care about this.  My impression is that the Houston commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let Sara Shackleton or Barbara Gray know as soon as possible. 
 I put your $500 check on your bed.  Nice ZERO points this week.  Do you not want the $630?  I only pulled a 5.  Really hurts me.  But mathematical I still have a chance.

 Mary or Lisa,  How does the agreement with EEA work?  Do we pay there a specified amount each month or do they charge per hour?  Please advise.  Thanks, Mike 
 Trevor,  This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago.  Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.  Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?    Mike Taylor 
 FYI . . .  Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA  >> Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be calculated right now because they will depend on how many banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are pretty much in that range. <<

 He mailed them out.  Did you not get them.  I am leading the league in fantasy.  No worries. 
 Yeah, 3-2 most probably.  One of his lines was a little out of wack.  Maybe 4-1 if you got that bet off.  Derek, said his computer at home would not pull it up. 
 Raj,  Things are tough.  People are thinking tomorrow is the day for a lot of layoffs for non-core groups.  40% chance we merge with Dynegy is what some people are saying.  Bankruptcy is our other option.  The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.  I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.  Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?  Mike 
 Ok, let me know if you got an extra ticket. 
 Sara will be responding from Enron.  She is conferring with the traders this morning. 
 Kerry,  Did everything go ok today?  Also, I cannot get into my hotmail.  Can you forward me any e-mails.  Thanks  I LOVE YOU  MIKE

 In 5 minutes, I already tried twice. 
  Can you forward my e-mail?  LOVE YOU!  Mike 
 If you haven't heard back in an hour or so, you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses.  Tana can show you where they sit if you don't already know. 
 I think Sara Shackleton was the last Enron lawyer to have worked on this. 
 Since this is for someone in the Governor's office, I have no objection.  I think we need to be careful when regulators who might have an interest in regulating the system are asking. 
 I was working in the NY office on 9/4 and here in the London office since 9/10. 
 I am stranded in London - there are worse places these days - but hope to get back tomorrow (Sunday).  Glad you are well. 
 I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home. 
 After a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security -- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in Houston.  I talked to Amanda after I checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport.  Did you have any trouble?

We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home. 
 I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.  In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.  From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.  Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.  Good luck!  Mark 
 Sounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.  You might try these:  In Sedona: Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)  In Scottsdale/Phoenix: Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews) The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool) The Boulders (also highly rated)  At the Canyon El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)  In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon): The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon 
 Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d). 
 If you have not already done so this week, please remember to update your work reports for me this afternoon.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I'll be on the call.

 Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.  I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.  Has Amanda made it back yet? 
 What about Noble?  Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet? 
 Example 1  Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a "Loss" to Party A from the termination) Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a "Gain" to Party B from the termination) There are no Unpaid Amounts  The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99 Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)    Example 2  Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts  The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39 Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)   Let me know if you need any further explanation.

 While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue. 
 Go for it. 
 Hopefully just a nuisance. 
 See you there. 
 Looks OK to me. 
 The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.  I have trouble with the second one.  This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.  Can you call me on this one? 
 Sounds good to me.

 Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis f= rom a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the tra= nsactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake tr= ades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is n= ot blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We h= ave been handling these by using a written termination rather than a revers= e trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders h= ave agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by= mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the c= onfirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you= a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out o= f a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake = is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is= mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the o= riginal trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alter= native we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's= "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I= know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

 Wish we could go - but we're off to Ft. Lauderdale this evening.  Are you in town next weekend?  If not, let's try for something on a weeknight. 
 Congrats Justin!  Good job!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Jan - can you please take care of scheduling this. 
 I have asked the tax guys to talk to you directly since I am in South America this week.  If you have not heard from them, you might try calling Stephen Douglas or Jeff Blumenthal.  They are the tax experts for EnronOnline. 
 Thanks for your note.  My company has revised our e-mail addresses.  Please change my address in your records to Mark.Taylor@enron.com.  Thanks! 
 I have no objection to changing the product name.  The tax issue concerns the location of the trader - if the guy managing the prices is in London but the transactions are with ENA, there may be tax implications.  Mark

 Any idea why this question came up? 
 I found this picture of my boat on the internet! 
 My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline:  1.  The online "making of a market" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction. 3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation of the "Stack Manager" which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person. 4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line "short description" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty. 5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place. 6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application) 7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders. 8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested. 9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.

 Here's another lawyer applicant for the paralegal job - I don't remember this one either...... 
 This one I remember seeing before but I don't remember making an interview decision one way or the other. 
 Thanks Tara! 
 The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions:  Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin= e=20 something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20 Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the= =20 relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20 referring to the quality as well.  Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?  The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes= =20 more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa= me=20 units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number= =20 some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.= =20 The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit= . =20 It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20 volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20  Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC.  The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.)  If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'.  Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description.   So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this:  A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20 shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th= e=20 General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20 The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv= e=20 Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20 Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20 Date>. =20 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling= =20 Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20 CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20 Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20 LSAJCAWZH04). The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit= =20 per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per= =20 month.=20   If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b= e=20 more like this:  A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of= =20 DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the= =20 Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition= s=20 will apply to this Transaction. =20 The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv= e=20 Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20 Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20 Date>. =20 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling= =20 Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20 CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20 Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20 LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles. The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per= =20 month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont= h.=20 Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20 number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe= r of=20 Bandwidth Units.  Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve= =20 the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.  Mark 
 Thanks for your quick reply.  My apologies for asking so many questions wit= h=20 obvious answers.  I hope I didn't waist too much of your time.  I also had = a=20 chat with Dave Forster yesterday in which he set me straight on many of the= se=20 issues.  Thanks for creating all of this so fast!  Mark 
 I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.  While they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that fit in the docking station?).  In case it isn't working, can we get her set up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday morning?  Mark 
 I haven't been able to get into any off these things.  Do you know what they are? 
 My only comment would be to suggest that the Password Application and registration form be referred to as "available online".  Describing them as "online" forms may lead some to believe that they can be filled out and submitted online while in fact the Password Application must be printed out and signed before being sent to us.  Mark 
 Hey Amanda!  Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is pretty good.  I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time). When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The Caribbean sure sounds good right about now...... 
 I will be out of the office at a seminar on Thursday and Friday of this week. 
 I am in an all-day seminar tomorrow and Friday - I'm afraid we may have to miss this one. 
 Jason - if you have time, would you please take a look at this? 
 We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.  Well, maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle. But I do have several questions:  Do we have a similar system here in NA? Are we expected to review all of these?  Is there some way to filter out the junk?  To whom should I address these questions? 
 Here is the Japanese repsonse which also contains our inquiry. 
 I don't think this person's experience is the right fit for our paralegal position. 
 This person doesn't have the kind of experience that we are looking for but she might work for one of the other groups in the department.  I am forwarding this to Ann-Elizabeth White who may know of an appropriate spot. 
 These do not appear in my SRRS but I would approve them if I could. 
 You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.  Can you resend so I'll have the dates?  My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.  If I can get there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm sure I'll find a room somewhere close by. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 This does not appear in my SRRS but I would approve it if I could. 
 In case you have to work late again and need a smile or two...... 
 In the future, please print these out for me instead of sending them by e-mail.  Thanks! 
 I agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea. Either the electronic or manual system will be admissable, but the electronic system strikes me as more reliable.  I'm more concerned witht he effectiveness of the notification - it's still not clear to me that adding a line on the ticker will be satisfactory.  In fact, it clearly is not satisfactory for changes in the ETA or a GTC.  Those documents will have to be clicked on again if any changes are made, the only remaining question being how do you highlight the changes.  The significant gray area is still changes to the Long Descriptions. 
 Yes, I will take care of this one. 
 Let me know if this is what you had in mind. 
 Is this for you? 
 I have revised my profile to give you calendar management access - sorry about the delay. 
 We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?  I doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Thanks for taking care of this!  Sorry if I caused any confusion. 
 Release Date: 05/04/00 New York Mercantile Exchange Announces E-Commerce Venture  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Nachamah Jacobovits (212) 299-2430 Maria Gonzalez (212) 299-2436 NEW YORK, NY, May 4, 2000 - The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX, an e-commerce venture that is intended to become the premier, global exchange for over-the-counter (OTC) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts. The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture. The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position. eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, depending on the session. The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets. The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot cash market products also offered. Over time, this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, weather, and emissions. Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations. In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC trading. Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, "The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts." Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems: ? Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange. ? The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with "bricks & mortar". ? The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be used to provide counter-party risk management ? Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities. eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave the meeting I was in with her to call.  I tried to call you in London just now but there was no answer.  If you are still around, please feel free to try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy to set up a time that works for you.  Mark 
 The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.  Before I talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues you know of? Thanks, Mark

 Would you please take care of this ASAP 
 Here is the draft of the questionnaire for local counsel.  Let me know what you think. 
 If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform (group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is checking).  If the NDA is something else, please let me know.    Louise Kitchen 05/16/2000 06:10 AM 
 Thanks for that - I had completely forgotten about the insurance issue. 
 This is why he never got it. 
 I think these will be the first days Susan Bailey gets back from being out. Please make sure this is OK with her and you guys coordinate on what's going on.    Susan Flynn 05/16/2000 11:19 AM 
 You're right - I had my weeks mixed up.  Since we are one person short I'd still appreciate it if you guys would coordinate to make sure there isn't any undue confusion. 
 Thanks Mark - these are mine and I'll ask Louise to be more careful in her addressing.    Mark A Taylor@EES 05/16/2000 03:10 PM 
 Please be careful in addressing e-mails to me - several of yours (re: Follow-up on Friday's meeting) have gone to the other MarkTaylor (Mark A Taylor).  I just found out when he forwarded them on to me. 
 PeopleFinder <peoplefinder@enron.com> 05/16/2000 09:13 PM Please respond to peoplefinder 
 It looks like we should send him the term sheet. 
 Frank -  There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough, our corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both sides are getting it right).  Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we can.  Mark 
 Yes - in fact it is already on my calendar!    Andrea Bertone@ENRON 05/18/2000 09:55 AM 
 I am available - best after 6:30 or 7:00.  Where is always difficult - quieter as opposed to noisy & crowded - but not dead either (I'm not picky am I?).  Any suggestions?    "Jim Avant" <jfa@daplaw.com> 05/18/2000 02:56 PM 
 They shouldn't be doing any trading so I hope we won't need those things.    Tana Jones 05/18/2000 04:23 PM 
 What is your anticipated start date in Houston?  We need to work on a place for you to sit. 
 I got a call from AEP asking that we have Louise initial the changes we made in the CA and fax it back to them - is she here today? 
 The only other matters I know of are (i) the Thursday morning interview of Timothy Hailes for a position in the Houston Swap Group and (ii) that Mark mentioned to me that he is planning a trip up to Teeside on Wednesday.  We are trying to set up another interview on Thursday (with David Lacey) but it hasn't been finalized yet.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 This is the North America version.  There are a number of variations for different jurisdictions.  You can see them all on the website by going to enrononline.com and then going to the "How to Register" page.  There is a drop-down that lists all of the available PA's. 
 Justin -  David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston time Tuesday.  Any chance you might be available to listen in? 
 They said they had agreed but I have not seen a copy initialed by them.    Andy Zipper@ENRON 05/22/2000 04:04 PM 
 Mark -  You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction as two separate issues.  For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any particular court.  The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to sue us in Alberta.

 Yes, I spoke to her earlier this week. 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you in response to your voice-mail.  I was hoping I could talk to Carol and Sara to see if anyone remembers why we incorporate the Credit Support Documents by reference.  Regarding the cross-default, we usually do not expand the definition since we don't want to bring in other derivatives transactions - of course that was before we started doing derivatives under various master agreements with the same entities.  It may be time to revisit this one.    Paul Simons 05/26/2000 11:46 AM 
 Looks good to me.    Sara Shackleton 05/30/2000 08:13 AM 
 This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it was sent to counsel.    Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/29/2000 12:53 PM 
 Alan - I know Jeff is out of town and may not see this right away so I thought I would forward it on to you.

 Bryan -  The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations. Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?  Mark    Bryan Seyfried 05/30/2000 08:09 AM 
 Thanks for your note.  In reply:  1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.  2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document.  Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.  Mark    "Stephen Kruft" <Stephen_Kruft@swissre.com> 05/31/2000 08:56 AM 
 That certainly makes sense to me.  I had better talk to Paul about the appropriate procedures going forward.    Bryan Seyfried 05/31/2000 09:36 AM

 One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.  "Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."  "No problem-just let me in," said the lawyer  "Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."  "Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven," said the lawyer  "Sorry, we have rules," said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.  The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.  The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.  Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he got on the elevator.  The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he found St. Peter waiting for him. "Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven," he said.  So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.  "So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you must choose your eternity," he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."  So St. Peter escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.  The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh  The lawyer stammered:   "I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable."  The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.  "Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours."  >> (Life in the Law Firm) >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >

 There is a meeting on my calendar for Friday morning to discuss Phase 2 content issues with people from the Research Group - not sure if this is the same issue or not.    Bob Shults 05/31/2000 08:23 PM 
 Susan - Please send this guy a sample form of each of the Omnibus, Industrial and ISDA (both printed form and schedule).  Thanks 
 Jason - would you take a quick look at this - I think Legal in London will be negotiating it so you don't have to be particularly thorough - but I thought you might have some insights given your recent experience with our other content agreements.  Thanks, Mark 
 I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some input into the review process for John and this should certainly be mentioned.  If you need my help in any way, please let me know.

 Approved. 
 This may prove helpful. 
 If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.  My impression is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading financially.  If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.  In each case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.  Our only issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.  As to the credit issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading under the existing terms.  As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them go ahead.  If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always stop trading.  Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.  The so-called "omnibus" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.  Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute basis.  She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get the necessary software to access the database.  Of course, if any issues come up in the meantime, please continue to feel free to call. 
 Another thing we'd like to talk about on Monday is the danger of becoming a Commodity Trading Advisor and the kinds of things we should look out for in the proposed website content.  For example, we have heard repeated references to "market commentary" and we will need to develop some sort of guidelines to give the commentators.

 I agree with you on 1, Passport should be Password and I have put a call in to Tony Pryor to ask about #3.    David Forster@ENRON 06/08/2000 05:58 PM 
 Here is the most recent draft of the Posting Agreement which we would like to discuss with you at our meeting tomorrow. 
 This is certainly a tough one.  We go to great lengths to avoid regulation here and have been fairly successful to date.  We do have some oversight from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding our power trading and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised. If it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations (but that's just complying with the Eligible Swap Participant and Trade Option Exemption rules).  It is true we are a member of the NYMEX and subject to their rules but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the NYMEX.  It might be more helpful to talk to the guys in London about our SFA regulatory status.  We have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states.    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 06/13/2000 02:56 AM 
 Sorry about the delay.  Here are my responses: 1.  Yes, this is primarily a tax issue.  However, there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific PA provisions for those countries.  2. No.  Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that only the first time they trade that product.  The GTC's are arranged by "Product Type" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade.  3. No.  But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.  4.  This one doesn't make much sense to me.  EnronOnline itself doesn't make any money.  There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.  EnronOnline is actually providing them a service.  5.  I really have no idea.  I guess we would have to print out the records and have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified.  6. So far we haven't deleted anything.  If we need to keep the records for a long time we probably can but this has not been discussed.      Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 06/08/2000 11:36 AM 
 Were you thinking about presenting re: EnronOnline or attending to hear what the others have to say?    Mark E Haedicke 06/14/2000 08:48 AM 
 Thanks for your note.  It is kind of exciting.  I think this attachment is probably the treaty you want.  I'm sorry it didn't "save" better but I think you can probably print it out legibly.  I have a copy printed from Westlaw.  Let me know if you want me to fax it. 
 Here is my first cut - what do you think? 
 Here is the language I mentioned in my voice mail.  Cynthia Sandherr's office should be getting in touch this afternoon with the addresses, forms of address, etc.  The letters need to be hand delivered in DC on Monday so they need to be fed exed to our DC office tonight.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Mark 
 Dan - How does this look? 
 Jason Peters (x39720) will be able to go with you - you might meet with him a bit ahead of time to fill him in on what you plan to do. 
 This looks like and ISDA comparison to me.  I'm not sure who is next on the list...... 
 Sorry for the delay - this looks fine to me.    Julie Ferrara 06/14/2000 04:56 PM 
 What about a "Personal Best" award? 
 Jeff & Carol:  As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.

 Dave:  Here is the agreement I received from London which I have revised to apply to the Chicago situation.  Let's consider this a rough draft at present.  It does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work.  let's get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't.  Let me know what time works for you.  Mark

 I've never heard of these guys - not sure who this could have been meant for.    Mark A Taylor@EES 06/28/2000 06:30 AM 
 Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?  Some other sites let you know what  time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.    James Bruce 06/28/2000 08:03 AM 
 We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them. Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still feel like you need to add something you might check with him.    James Bruce 06/28/2000 11:26 AM 
 FYI 
 Paul -  I think we handled this in Phase I through the Legal and Privacy Statement which is available through a link from each EnronOnline page, including the home page.  If memory serves, the advice (including the language for the Legal and Privacy Statement) came from Clifford Chance.  Justin will probably be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time.  Will that be sufficient for Phase II?  We can revise the Legal and Privacy Statement if that is necessary.  Mark    Nick Mooney 07/04/2000 09:50 AM 
 The EnronOnline guy responsible for the video is trying to get the contractor we used to get these guys to stop using our name.  Louise may want us to contact them if he is not successful. 
 As long as the coal lawyers have approved the contract forms it looks good to me.    Nick Mooney 07/05/2000 11:54 AM 
 This one came after the one you sent (which I commented on by voice mail) but is even worse.  I hope it was an earlier draft rather than a later one. 
 This sounds reasonable to me - any objections? 
 Either works for me.    Becky Tlucek 07/06/2000 04:10 PM

In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I believe an additional 10-12 days).  2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence until December 31, 2000.  Please let me know if there is anything else you need.  Mark 
 Let's stick with what we already have on order.  Is Frank ready to start Phase III as soon as Phase II is done?    Joya Davis 07/10/2000 09:16 AM 
 Attached is the story with my comments.  1.  I changed 'standard" to 'familiar' and deleted the reference to price discovery since these are elements of futures contracts, comparison to which we would like to avoid.  If the price reference is important, 'transparency' would work as a replacement for 'discovery.'  2.  The changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the PA and Reg. forms can be filled out online (they are available to be downloaded but must be signed and sent to us offline).      Suryan Wirya Simunovic 07/07/2000 09:07 AM 
 Thought you might be interested in this. 
 Do you know when they are building the walls around the cube we designated for Janet Moore?  She is concerned. 
 David:  Do you see any problems with a customer having the ability to chat with an Enron representative online?  Mark 
 Looks good to me - We should probably change Enron North America Corp. to EnronOnline LLC.    Leslie Hansen 07/11/2000 10:31 AM 
 Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.  David Mitchell thought he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he remembers it, we never got very far with the details.  He probably just advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.  I'll send over whatever we receive from him and warned him that you might be calling. 
 My comments:  It's not clear to me what it means to say that Joe Hockey "joined" in the launch (end of first paragraph). They may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in the fourth paragraph have increased (I think it's up to $90 bil.) . The word "values" should probably be "value" in the last line of the fourth paragraph.  Mark     Alan Aronowitz 07/11/2000 09:02 AM

 As per John's request. 
 The most recent news is that Carol has been admitted to the hospital and is in labor - things are looking ok.  I'll let you know if I hear anything new. 
 Do you have time to talk about the direct connection issues tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon at 3:00 NY time?  I also have some new issues regarding the need (or hopefully lack thereof) for written confirmations of online transactions which we can tee up then. 
 On that basis I think we can go ahead without any trouble.    David Forster@ENRON 07/12/2000 10:08 AM 
 Do you want to take a stab at this?  I'm happy to go over it with you if you are unsure. 
 This looks fine to me.  I would feel better without the Big "E" on the screen since I wouldn't think you would want to give the impression that each of your trading floors was an Enron office. 
 Here is the revised confirm - let's chat about the issues I mentioned in my voice mail. 
 Here is the confirm with the "out" built in. 
 Note that the No "Out" version requires us to pay the premium on Tuesday! 
 The least we can do is pass this news along.  Is there anyone else we should tell?    Ted Bockius <Ted.Bockius@ivita.com> 07/17/2000 02:21 PM 
 I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size).    David Forster@ENRON 07/17/2000 06:15 PM 
 Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me. 
 FYI 
 If you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in Amsterdam) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets.  I don't know where this stands officially (I haven't heard any developments since Amsterdam) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want.    Mark E Haedicke 07/18/2000 08:58 AM

 To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors.  I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in London).  Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there seems to be a problem with the attachment).  If you still have it, can you send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"? 
 I will take care of it.  Thanks for the reminder.    Janette Elbertson 07/19/2000 10:30 AM 
 Is there an hour or so tomorrow or Friday that Alan and I could claim to discuss the issues we teed up last week? 
 Numbers 2 and 3 still appear to be in the draft section.    Leonardo Pacheco@ENRON 07/19/2000 10:49 AM 
 Rick Buy asked me to chat with Sally Beck about this and apologized for not having consulted with Legal before submitting the report.  He indicated that the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized, at least in connection with legal documentation, as mandates.  Sally has been out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back in and explain the origins of these suggestions.    Peter Keohane 07/19/2000 03:42 PM 
 Our Credit Dept. normally handles the distribution of financial information to counterparties.  Tanya Rohauer has agreed to look into this.    Michelle Cash 07/19/2000 01:53 PM 
 Thanks for all the docs - I'll store that in a folder until they make me clean out all my files again.  What I really need, though is the current North America versions - which have changed since last September.  Does someone down there have a Word version of the current ETA and PA for NA? 
 There have not been any revisions to this version.  If someone else needs to receive/review, please let me or Leslie know. 
 Sorry about the delay.      Janet Place@ENRON 07/20/2000 11:06 AM 
 As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.     EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access. 
 It turns out they're talking about something completely different.  I can fill you in on it next time we get together.    Leslie Hansen 07/20/2000 12:36 PM 
 I think we're talking about a Senior Legal Specialist position.  Do you have the posting that we used last year (when we hired Susan Flynn)?  I think it would have gone out in July or August. 
 You're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other counterparties.  I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can always ask).  I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by someone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.  It seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with rogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders decides to damage the company?  Having said that, I think that even without the last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and don't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they can show they weren't authorized.    Leslie Hansen 07/20/2000 12:25 PM 
 My back office suggestion is that the master user id and password be held by the back office.  The master user has the ability to open and close sub-user (i.e. individual trader) user ids and passwords.  So if a trader leaves, the back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader. They can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 5 days.  I suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is the disgruntled employee.    Leslie Hansen 07/20/2000 02:23 PM 
 I'm not sure who Diana is - do you know if someone has been in contact with the COMEX and has received their permission?    David Forster@ENRON 07/21/2000 07:49 AM 
 The only changes were in the definition of Floating Price - otherwise this is the same as the "no-out" version we prepared last week. 
 Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the master agreement process at all.  She indicated that if she had noticed that she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to that effect now.  The net result is that the only change regarding financial trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk in Calgary to handle derivatives confirmations.  Jeff Sorensen will coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom. 
 I will be leaving at noon on August 4.  Please add to the calendar. 
 Any chance you can help with this? 
 Yes, I think you are right.    Teresa G Bushman 07/20/2000 05:09 PM 
 This message was returned to me - it looks like your name is misspelled in the Performance Management program. 
 It depends on what we need it for - if it is just to get the counterparty's financials, the Credit Group has a form they can send out without legal review.  If there is more to it than that, you may want to check with the paralegals and see what is in the current form bank.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 07/25/2000 09:16 AM 
 As we discussed. 
 How do you feel about this?    Andrea Calo@ENRON 07/25/2000 03:11 PM 
 I believe I approved this yesterday.  If further action is required, please let me know.    Information Risk Management 07/25/2000 05:46 PM 
 Simon:  Sorry about the delay.  I know we subscribe to various information services from Bloomberg and Reuters, but I am not aware of any relationship we have with Thomson Financial - then again that's not too surprising.  I suggest you talk to the people in investor relations and maybe the Info Central people who may have subscribed to such services.  The only way I would have heard about them would be if they were to be used for EnronOnline or in the highly unlikely event that they had consulted me on the subscription contracts.  Please feel free to call if I can be of any other help.  Mark (x37459)    Simon Duff 07/12/2000 07:39 AM 
 Paul:  Here is the FSA letter with my comments inserted in red.  I have tried to make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely "arguable."  The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.  The language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. EnronOnline.  Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC? It is also a Delaware limited liability company.  Are we afraid it may have a  I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.  If this has not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for them.  My position would be that EEFT is a party to that agreement whenever it is necessary in connection with an investment.  Mark

 sorry for the delay 
 I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all go to East Power Trading?

 I'm sorry I've been so hard to get ahold of lately.  Will you be available this afternoon - say around 3:30 or 4:00 (I'm pretty well booked until then). 
 Which makes it hard to call.  If you get this I'm at 713-853-7459 or you can e-mail back your number.  Sorry about that. 
 Justin:  Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.  I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.  Mark 
 Looks fine to me.    Suryan Wirya Simunovic 07/28/2000 06:32 AM 
 Looks good to me - don't forget the ENA Legal offsite 10/5 & 6 (it's usually over by noon on Friday - Travis could probably let you know for sure).    Sara Shackleton 07/31/2000 08:38 AM 
 That works for me.    Patrick Hansen@ENRON 07/31/2000 09:55 AM 
 I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....  Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and just after you're born.  A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in fetuses and newborns.  Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA.  Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and mackerel. 
 It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard of Jerry Peskuchi.    Tana Jones 08/04/2000 09:16 AM 
 Did you get this?  I didn't see your name on the addressee list. 
 Taffy - could you please reply & coordinate with the relevant people. 
 Travis -  In Phase I we had the copyright notice on every page.  Can we get away with having it only on the home page?    Travis McCullough 08/03/2000 05:28 PM 
 Is this OK with you? 
 FYI 
 It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you as much notice as possible.  Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet? 
 Yes - please go ahead and forward a copy to Ed.  I don't think Mark Holsworth needs to be involved in this one.  Unfortunately, I don't know of anything directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time (I guess Justin coordinated that - I don't remember reading it).    Leslie Hansen 08/08/2000 02:20 PM 
 This may be pertinent. 
 Looks like Justin has already contacted S&C. 
 The whole schedule has yet to be determined.  I'm still waiting for final seating charts from the other groups so I can figure out how to most efficiently get people moved into their new homes.  We'll let you know as soon as possible.    Suzanne Adams 08/09/2000 11:08 AM 
 My only concern is the 8 hours out of date reference.  As of when?  It might not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being read?  Would it hurt to say something to the effect of "By the time you read this" as a lead in?  Are we sure that even this is accurate?  How long from press run til the first copy hits the street?

 I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.  I reiterated that we have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.   She confirmed that ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.  The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our "Phil Graham card", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength for us and we should not play the card until we need to.  Stacey agreed with a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill. Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the process - possibly mid September.    Mark E Haedicke@ECT 08/11/2000 09:30 AM

 Thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.  Yes we are all very sad about Jim's baby.  Many years ago my sister had a child who was born two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they couldn't save him.   I know how painful that was for them.   And I have to admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly for you guys that first few days.  I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't received the replacements yet but will ask.  Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this stage.  We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical stuff.  We'll look forward to seeing you soon.

 Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had heard back from outside counsel. 
 John - In case you need this right away, I've made a few changes below and this is probably adequate.  If you have a little more time, I can polish it up a bit tomorrow.  Just let me know.    John Peyton 08/14/2000 04:30 PM 
 Please remove me from your distribution list. 
 My comments are included (in section 1 only) 
 Please add the ENA offsite Oct. 5 & 6. 
 I talked to Kathy, gave her some basic advice to relay on the subject and told her that if Alcoa has further questions they can call me.  One issue for you - do you know whether or not we have a power master of some kind with Alcoa and did we need to send them an override letter? 
 Don't forget my half-day on August 4.    Taffy Milligan 08/16/2000 11:09 AM 
 I had a lengthy conference call with a bunch of Milbank lawyers this afternoon to educate them on the EnronOnline structure.  I received the attached message this evening - just fyi. 
 John:  Thanks for your note.  Brent Hendry is now our primary weather derivatives lawyer and I am forwarding this to him.    John Viverito@ENRON 08/16/2000 04:53 AM 
 FYI 
 The construction team has told us that your new offices will be ready some time next week.  Joya will be in touch to schedule your moves into your new homes! 
 I have reviewed the schedule and have a few questions/comments - nothing major.  I have left a voice-mail for Alicia and will be happy to deal with her directly if you want. 
 My comments marked on the attached. 
 Dennis & Michael:  It looks like this is an EnronCredit.com matter.  Could you please take care of this and coordinate with David Weekes or, in his absence, Gillian Johnson (in Houston).  Thanks for your help!  Mark 
 Elaine:  Please coordinate with the legal department in London on these issues.  They are familiar with arranging for Enron Corp. guaranties.  Mark 
 Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access. Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be limited to Australian entities. 
 Congratulations!  We'll have to chat soon.

 Let's get together & discuss early next week.    Sara Shackleton 08/18/2000 05:47 PM 
 The revised draft looks good to me. 
 I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response. The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant construction site.  I remember hearing that there were times that the construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the protesters.  I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever heard of them?) report.  Mark 
 Congratulations Jeff!  And great pictures - big brother looks a bit happier than the last time I saw him.  Mark 
 We should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so that we can determine appropriate attendees and get it on their calendars. Do you have anything in particular in mind?  Were you thinking legal/regulatory/operations/business/marketing?  Hope you're having a fun weekend!

 Hey guys - welcome home!  At least I assume you're home by now.  How was the trip?  I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have gotten better.  Any hope you took digital pictures?  I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought your wedding was.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.  Magical doesn't seem like too strong a word.  Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.  It's been about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see why you enjoy it so much.  I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.  If you are still interested, we really need to start planning right away.  I tentatively booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a busy travel season.  Just let me know.  Mark 
 This was one of your competitors - at least from the legal side - that we looked at briefly about a year ago.  http://www.legalanywhere.com/legal/index.html 
 Glad to hear the rest of your trip went well.  The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.  In an effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.  Because of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.  You could do a shorter trip, of course, but I never have.  I've gone for longer (we did a 10 day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long trip and certainly not necessary.  Most of the charter fleets are based where there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.  One of the reasons for aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days spent.  I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.  I haven't taken all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that works better for you guys.  My views on when to go:  January - March Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded (harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.  April - May Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.  June - August No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.  September - October See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes (http://www.storm2000.com).  My guess is that people who planned their trips to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got  GREAT deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.  I've chartered during this period several times and had a blast.  One time a tropical storm came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of the stories.  You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat back and let them deal with it).  November - December Hurricane threat drops dramatically.  Crowds pick up around Christmas, everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.  Bottom line:  I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - just let me know what works best for you guys.  Keep in mind that you do have to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make sure you get flights and the boat that you want.  One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to pick someone up.  This is definitely suboptimal.  You learn a lot about the boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain or wherever.  I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.  Mark

 I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.  I'm assuming that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade.    Tana Jones 08/21/2000 04:14 PM 
 Dear John:  So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:  Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly.  Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.  Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).  Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it then becomes a default allowing termination.  Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen?  Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?  Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?  The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents, etc.  Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations (the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back in.  Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it the way it is.  Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about?  Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.  On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra $5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded.  Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.  I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things.  We're looking forward to having you back. 
 Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the day and then reactivates it?

 CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Approved re: monitor.  What is our policy on printers for lawyers?  I know a number of people (including me) have them but I don't know how that happens. 
 John - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is.  With respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit.  It is certainly not necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.    John Viverito@ENRON 08/30/2000 07:49 PM 
 Here is the current list of countries (as per advice received today from UK counsel):  Approved: UK Germany Austria Switzerland Finland Portugal Poland  Approved if prizes are not awarded: Netherlands Norway Sweden Italy  Not Approved under any circumstances: Denmark Spain France 
 I'm not sure why that shouldn't count.  Any trades done can be booked into RMT and then into ECT if necessary to hedge with third parties. 
 Yes, Mary is still in 3807.  Is the printer you mentioned the smallest/cheapest one we can get? 
 It's not looking good for getting back to you today on this - shaping up to be a very bad day and we need to coordinate with Credit for their responses as well.  I have a call in to John Suttle and have forwarded the revised draft to him.  We'll do what we can.  I saw your reply to my previous note.  On this one point:  It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial entities.  I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position.  I understand.  My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is not.  As we both agree, the  issue may be moot depending on what Credit thinks. 
 FYI 
 I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take beginners.  I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier thread.  I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.  The only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't quite ready.  I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I know.  They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.  If you use their provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there right on time.  Having several people (but not too many) around this time is helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.  Of course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done on time.  Check with your charter company about attending the briefings before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may require 2 people from your boat to attend.  As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight on Norman Island.  There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as long as you're not in too late.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine.  There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, there is at least very little ashore to bother you.  The caves are just around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving either that afternoon or first thing the next day.  Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.  My advice running roughly clockwise:  skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless you're clearing customs);  skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your trash on board - there's nowhere to put it);  Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;  Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop and a swim;  don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the channel in is well marked;  if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back;  it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met that way;  the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones reserved for commercial craft;  I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?);  the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there (10 cents a gal.?).  Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be able to see everything).  The only difficulty might be if you need to get the boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back well before noon.  Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - many of them can get quite crowded.  Of course, if you're going anytime between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!  Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.  A few of the islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers either.  But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.  Ask at your chart briefing for the best spots these days.  If you have divers along, don't miss the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.  The cruising guide will have lots of info on all these issues.  Wish I was going - it's always a blast! 
 Yes, thanks - these are mine. 
 The commercial guys have asked me for an update on where we stand with BP. Any news? 
 I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's reply.  I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.  Have you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans soon - that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know. 
 I have no idea since I never read the original - I just thought it was an interesting approach to take when making a modification.    Louise Kitchen 09/05/2000 11:21 AM 
 Congratulations on your promotion!  Well deserved and long overdue. 
 I don't think I have any problems with this presentation - but can you give me an idea of the proposed audience? 
 Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).  Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!  What would you think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?  That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later.  I have a couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger  group.  They're a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors  too!

 We were working on Brazil (Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo was heading it up) but I think they have stopped for now.  I'll look for her latest e-mail and forward it to you.  The others are all new.  Tana can give you the form of local counsel survey we have been using if you want it.    Travis McCullough 09/05/2000 08:06 PM

 Here is the confirm with my revisions: 
 Please discard the version I sent a few minutes ago.  Here is a clean copy with one additional change and a marked copy to show all of the changes from the original: 
 Can you let me know who at BP in London is holding things up?  Larry Gagliardi here in Houston has asked so he can give the name to his counterpart in the US.    Justin Boyd 09/06/2000 06:54 AM 
 Nice try, but no.    Tana Jones 09/06/2000 04:32 PM 
 First choice: New Years if Bill & Amanda can get the first week of 2001 off. Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there. Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving. I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might work if nothing else does.

 Can you check and make sure Hector Ramirez is still with ECT?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it= =20 looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow= =20 and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While = we=20 have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20 master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many= =20 of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20 trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be= =20 helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20 mark-up.  Following are my points responsive to their revisions:  Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the= =20 possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20 example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy= =20 this agreement would be in default).  (g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk= =20 to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a= =20 reason to remove it.  Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells= =20 out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar= e=20 not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we= =20 agree we will put it in the agreement.  Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha= t=20 payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne= t=20 (i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to= =20 make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o= ne=20 payment).  This is not acceptable.  (h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E= NA.  Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20 receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20 provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20 possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be= =20 honored.  (c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same= =20 city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n= ot=20 impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20  (e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no= t=20 have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go= =20 as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20 practice.  (g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t= o=20 multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each= =20 IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never= =20 trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we= =20 will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like= =20 to restrict ourselves that way.  (i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If= =20 there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu= t=20 wholesale deletion is out of the question.  (j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while= =20 maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency= =20 with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is= =20 important to us.  (k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha= t=20 went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. = =20 We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o= ur=20 revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe= r=20 high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i= s=20 more appropriate.  (m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20 protects us both.  (n)  You know more about this than I.  Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20 individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio= ns=20 are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a= =20 significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)= =20 and we need to know now if they object to any of them.  Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  = I=20 hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus= s=20 any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20 IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th= e=20 volume and nature of their comments. 
 Agreed.    Dave Samuels 09/07/2000 08:07 AM 
 Good catch.  NY law should apply throughout the Americas and in Japan.  We used UK law in Europe and Singapore on the theory the counterparties there would be more comfortable with Uk law.  I'm not sure which the Australians would prefer.  What do you think of the following:  16.

 Approved. 
 Is this something you are working on? 
 Go for it.  That is shaping up to be the kind of day we may cancel the group meeting any way - my first day back after vacation and everybody trying to get lots done so we can get away to the Woodlands.

 Welcome Back!  Looks like BP has finally signed.  As I understand it, this should open the way to get them signed up in the U.S. 
 Just FYI, I think the EnronOnline decision was to leave the User ID off of the Password Application as a security measure.  The User ID is sent separately (I think in a security envelope) so that the User ID and password are never written down in the same place.  And of course the system requires that the password be changed the first time the new user logs on so the Enron file copy of the PA won't give access to a user's valid password.

 Amanda,  Thanks for your note.  It looks to me like the schedule breaks down as follows:  Possible Date: October 12 - 15 My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for its great sailing)  Possible Date: November 3 - 8 My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that (makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go  Possible Date: Thanksgiving My Reaction: You guys can't make it  Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the office Mon. 1/8/01) My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet)  Possible Date: Later in 2001 My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long  So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a second choice.  If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 2001 when Bill can go we can do that, too.  What are you guys thinking? Since we won't be going at Thanksgiving, how are you going to talk your mom into dealing with the holiday?  Mark

 I've been to Argentina - what can I tell you about it?  We need to get sailing soon!  Ever get to Houston?  I have a boat here but don't sail too much - just working too hard.  Hope you're well!

 As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the next to be demolished & reconstructed.  While the current timetable is not firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA offsite).  I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could begin the packing process.  Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will schedule the actual move. 
 Your new offices will be ready in a week or so.  We anticipate your moves will take place over the weekend of September 29.  Joy Davis will coordinate your moves and can help with obtaining boxes, etc. 
 Sorry - forgot to cc you on this one.

 Greg,  Here is the ETA version in my directory.  I think a few minor changes may have been made (e.g. EnronOnline LLC is now the Enron party) and the definitive version is on the website.  You can access it there if you have a guest user ID.  If you need an ID, just let me know and we'll have the EOL people issue one for you.  I'm also attaching an early version of the Password Application (current versions also online and accessible even without an ID) since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the ETA.  I usually think of the two pieces as one agreement.  Mark        Greg Johnston 10/17/2000 06:21 PM

 Oops - forgot the attachment: 
 Can you reply to Justin & let him know where we stand? 
 Are you guys around this weekend?  Any particular plans? 
 Initial thoughts -  Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron Japan?  Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word "ordinary" or maybe the entire phrase "in the ordinary course of its business"?  Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or "no action" type of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?  It may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.  If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.  If necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal sanctions issue to Mark H.  (What are the potential sanctions?)     Jane McBride@ENRON 10/20/2000 05:26 AM 
 Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to have access to these products?  The general rule has been to allow complete access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to trade what doesn't seem to enter into it.    Tana Jones 10/20/2000 09:49 AM 
 Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions. 
 Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)   This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar for the offline confirms. 
 I got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the Senator's staff before sending the letter.  It would be embarrassing to suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us.  Re: the letter itself, if you want to make it even stronger, you could point out in your discussion of EnronOnline that we believe that the site could have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill. 
 Here are my revisions.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 You can remove me from the distribution list.

 My answers below in red.    Bob Bowen 10/19/2000 10:39 AM 
 The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.  For instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of trade you are doing.  But I thought you guys had decided to use the first price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire month language attached so this may not be the final version.    Kim Stanley@ENRON 10/25/2000 04:02 PM 
 Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.    Alan Aronowitz 10/25/2000 04:16 PM

 I won't be able to be on the 11:30 call this morning.

If it is a Market Disruption Event the most likely outcome under the contract (since it will last more than 3 days and we presumably will not be able to negotiate an agreed price) is that "the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by ENA, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."  I'm not sure what dealer quotes would get us under these circumstances.  Can dealers quote prices in excess of the price cap?    Richard B Sanders 10/29/2000 09:01 AM 
 Just a few changes below.    David Forster@ENRON 10/23/2000 09:15 AM 
 Janette:  This may be more than you were looking for - let me know if you want me to pare it down a bit.  I assume we will have the opportunity to revise these as time goes on......   The Financial Trading/Net Works Group is responsible for the legal issues relating to the derivatives and agriculture commodities trading of Enron companies in the Americas and serving the legal needs of Enron Net Works LLC.  The derivatives trading includes natural gas, power and other energy commodity derivatives, weather, pulp & paper, interest rate, currency, credit, metals and equity related transactions.  The group drafts form templates for confirmations, drafts and negotiates master agreements with counterparties on a variety of forms and deals with issues raised by customers in connection with specific transaction confirmations.  Enron Net Works issues include the operation of EnronOnline and related trading sites and the various contractual and investment activities of Enron Net Works. The group coordinates the legal approval process for granting customer access to EnronOnline.    Janette Elbertson 10/30/2000 09:08 AM 
 Sorry about the delay.     Andrew Wilson@ENRON 10/25/2000 01:55 PM 
 Please be sure to access the performance review system as soon as possible to select persons to contribute to your review.  While commercial people are particularly helpful, you may select reviewers at any level. 
 Thought you might like this. 
 I will be happy to attend but do have a regular 9:00 meeting on Fridays.    Louise Kitchen 10/31/2000 08:31 AM 
 I want to underscore that moving just the banking stuff to a bill to pass this year is VERY bad and something we should vehemently oppose.    Chris Long@ENRON 10/31/2000 08:05 AM 
 Craig:  Sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier.  I  asked Tana Jones to get you access to our database that keeps track of financial master agreement negotiations so you will always be up to date on where we stand with the process.  If you haven't heard from her, please let me know.  Any word from Justin on which Enron entity we will use for trading in the U.S.?  Mark    Craig Young 10/31/2000 10:09 AM 
 Had a lengthy call with Milbank on Friday and another scheduled for this afternoon at 4:00 to find out how they're doing.    Andy Zipper@ENRON 11/01/2000 08:04 AM 
 I should be around all week - let me know what works for you.    Sami Arap@ENRON 11/01/2000 09:17 AM 
 FYI 
 Looks good to me.  Brent is the only other lawyer out that day.    Sara Shackleton 11/02/2000 05:18 PM 
 Edmund:  Have we submitted these forms for any new companies being formed? 
 Carol:  Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on (EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.  Mark 
 I enjoyed it too - actually it's just as well that I was carted off when I was - I was sound asleep by 8:30 and still feel the affects. 
 It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty should have known it was a mistake).  I'm afraid we've just been lucky that the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is too close to call obvious. 
 Mark Haedicke is on the left, Mark Frevert (Chairman of the wholesale markets subsidiaries) on the right.   Yours truly, et al 
 My changes marked. 
 Please use the PEP system on your computer to suggest reviewers by the end of the day tomorrow at the latest.  It is important that your reviewers have enough time to fill out the reviews and the system closes for that purpose at the end of next week.  If you have any questions or are having trouble accessing the system, please let me know. 
 Here is the MEH e-mail I mentioned 
 My comments are marked on the attached.      Andrew Wilson@ENRON 11/07/2000 02:40 PM 
 Bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that rather than creating a separate GTC for the brokers we refer to the GTCs already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the deal falls through.    RLawrence@milbank.com 11/08/2000 02:07 PM 
 Thanks David - these are fine.    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/08/2000 10:36 PM 
 How about 2:00? 
 Thanks for your concern but please don't worry about it.  I was able to get a lot accomplished since I was already here and the phones weren't ringing so it was a productive morning for me in any event.  I don't think I'm available for any of the remaining Saturdays this year but I'll give it another shot next time.    Charlene Jackson@ENRON 11/08/2000 07:31 PM 
 Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be (i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual matter.  I agree about Tana.  Mark    Greg Johnston 11/06/2000 02:34 PM 
 Yes, I was on the call.    Janette Elbertson 11/10/2000 08:41 AM 
 Nothing has changed - we are looking forward to having you work with us as soon as possible and to the extent possible within your other constraints.    Francisco Pinto Leite@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/09/2000 07:08 PM 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase of the office construction project is almost finished (we have been given a completion date of Monday, November 20).  There is good news and bad news. First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next construction phase which will begin as soon as possible after the current phase is finished.    Now the good:  we have an office for you to sit in until your new office is ready.  Joya Davis has submitted the move request and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move. 
 This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities,=20 interest rates and currencies. The older versions of the policy provided th= at=20 no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyone= =20 other than Enron.  Beyond that, no Enron employee could trade a commodity= =20 which was within their area of responsibility.  For example, I was not=20 permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but, since intere= st=20 rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility, I could trad= e=20 them.  As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more=20 difficult to identify the scope of the company's concern, much less to=20 articulate it.  We did however take a stab at it and the result is below. = =20 This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versio= n=20 of the Policy. =20  For now, I would suggest that the term "security" highlighted below should = be=20 read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered i= n=20 the second numbered clause (i.e. the word "other" refers to items other tha= n=20 those listed in clause (i)).  The result is that an Enron employee who does= =20 not trade financial instruments, securities, financial assets or liabilitie= s=20 for Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account.  To take this= a=20 step further, one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of= =20 energy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his= =20 or her own account but could trade other equities - if it were me, I would= =20 certainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it= . =20 Of course, a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for=20 personal trading - metals, ag commodities, bandwidth, freight, lumber, amon= g=20 many others - for all employees.

 I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by and see it.    Kay Mann@ENRON 11/10/2000 03:07 PM 
 Looks good to me. 
 Unfortunately I'm already booked for breakfast (which is unusual for me). I'm free for lunch though on both days if you are.    EFeo@milbank.com 11/10/2000 12:48 PM 
 The first market disruption fallback (after a 3 day waiting period) is an "Alternative Price Source" which would need to be spelled out in the long description - but that only works if we have an alternative price source to specify.  It's also important to make sure that the feared event is included in the Market Disruption Event definition.  I think this is the relevant language from the GTC:  7.  Market Disruption.  If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market Disruption Event.  If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or has been specified, and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than three Business Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a Floating Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if the parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day following the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by Enron, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes.  "Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to a Floating Price Source, any of the following events (the existence of which shall be determined in good faith by Enron):  (a) the failure of the Floating Price Source to announce or publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material suspension of trading in the relevant futures contract, options contract or commodity on the exchange or market (e.g., NYMEX) acting as the Floating Price Source (the "Exchange"); (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance or unavailability of any relevant Floating Price Source; (d) the temporary or permanent closing of any Exchange acting as the Floating Price Source; (e) the imposition of trading limits by the Exchange such that there are limits on the range within which the price of the relevant commodity may fluctuate in the prompt month and the closing or settlement price of such commodity on such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range; (f) a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price; or (g) a material change in the content, composition or constitution of the relevant commodity.      Greg Johnston 11/10/2000 12:41 PM 
 I'm going to be hard to get next week - Monday & Tuesday I'll be in NYC (speaking at a conference), Wed. a.m. in the office and the rest of the week at the management conference.  If it works for you, any time the following week (20, 21 or 22) would be better for me.  If it is urgent, let me know and I will try to break from my meetings during the day on Mon., Tues. afternoon or maybe Wed. (but since that's the only time I'll be in the office all week it's already pretty full).  Just let me know - my assistant (Taffy x57373) can set something up on my calendar if you have a time you want to reserve. 
 Lunch on Monday would be great - anything in particular in mind?    EFeo@milbank.com 11/10/2000 04:34 PM 
 I'm speaking at a conference in ny again but never got around to making any plans - any chance you're free? 
 Hello from Texas.  It's probably been about six years since we last spoke but I thought I'd drop you a line to see how you were doing.  I saw Pete Datos for brunch when I was in town a couple of years ago and he seemed to be fine but I have been very bad about staying in touch with people.  Ted Bockius & I are still together - he works at an internet start-up company doing their public relations work.  I'm still a corporate lawyer at Enron working on financial contracts and e-commerce stuff.  I get to nyc 3 or 4 times a year so we should get together for a drink or a meal some time and catch up.  Hope you are well.  Mark 
 I'll be at the Peninsula (55th & 5th) (212)956-2888.  I will have my cell phone but no guarantees that the battery will last (713)206-8080.  Either of the places you mentioned would be fine with me - my conference is at the PLI Center (on 7th around 51st or 52nd).  Just tell me when & where! 
 I concur in David's analysis.  Any idea who the target market is in HK?  If we have specific customers in mind, would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available? It's not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted HK residents, just not the public.    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/12/2000 08:14 PM 
 Wednesday morning is the only time I will be in the office all week and is already fully booked.  Will you be in San Antonia later?  Maybe we can meet then.    Michael Guerriero@ENRON 11/13/2000 07:32 AM 
 I'm staying at the Peninsula 956-2888.  I can't stay out late tonight because my talk is in the morning - what about lunch tomorrow? 
 I think I'll try to run this by Michelle Cash real quick - I'll get right back to you. 
 I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved. Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.  Mark 
 The system won't let me connect to approve your reviewers from outside the office.  I'll do it first thing Wednesday morning but since they'll only have 2 days left to fill out the forms at that point, if there are any you particularly want, I suggest you call or e-mail them to let them know it is coming. 
 Unfortunately I am already booked for Wednesday. 
 Taffy - please print this out for the EnronOnline file. 
 What a great poem!  Sorry for the confusion on getting together - I'll try to start earlier next time.

 Bob - These are the only versions I have in Word format - they were probably modified slightly in the online version (e.g. Enron party is now EnronOnline LLC). 
 Thanks for your note - that will make packing easier.  My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.  I don't like to take those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop flight.   It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to lose your luggage. 
 Please send a copy of the Energy Gateway docs to Luis Derrota - EB838. 
 If they've done it, it was without consulting me.  Other than the content stuff (e.g. which provide links to Reuters) I don't think there is anything out there yet.    Travis McCullough 11/20/2000 09:03 PM

 We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in the UK.    Marie Westin 11/20/2000 05:23 AM 
 Here is the first draft. 
 Yes, I'd like the tickets if they're available. 
 I don't know if this will be helpful or not.... 
 Done - sorry for the delay. 
 Glad you liked it.  There is a while series of e-mail symbols people use like smiley faces - they even have a name: emoticons.  They don't often look like you'd expect and most of them are sideways -  only one I know is the smiley face  :-)   Hope you had a nice birthday!  Love , Mark 
 Let me know if this is not what you need.

 I decided I needed the book we discussed so I went online to Amazon.com and ordered it!  While there I found references to a number of books I tought you might be interested in:  the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet") the Ramage series from Dudley Pope Revolution at Sea Trilogy/James L. Nelson Lobscouse & Spotted Dog : Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, Lisa Grossman Thomas 
 I'll be there.

 I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request. Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far in advance we need to schedule the churn.  The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is done) will be put in the cubes we have.  When we run out of cubes we have space to build more.

 Here is the revised BETA - let me know what you think.  The changes are marked in blue. 
 Here is the BETA with our initial comments. 
 As we discussed a couple of weeks ago...... 
 Tammy:  Brent still reports to me and I believe he should be paid from my RC.  Please let me know if this causes a problem.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Can one of you guys handle this in Stacy's absence? 
 Does this raise uncertainty for products offered by non-banks? 
 This looks ok to me.    Melba Lozano 12/06/2000 04:46 PM 
 These look OK to me.    Andrew Wilson@ENRON 12/08/2000 11:11 AM 
 FYI 
 Peter:  Here is our first attempt at EnronOnline Long Description language for the double transaction calendar spread product.  We had to guess at several aspects. Please let me know if we got close.  Mark 
 Thanks so much for the Christmas present.  Everyone is enjoying it very much.  Bob Bruce's first reaction was "Wow -- I hope this isn't in lieu of her ever coming back!" 
 Marc:  In what currency will the proposed DPC hedge be denominated? 
 So now it's clear? 
 I thought I'd send this around just as a reminder of the RMT guidelines.  As far as I know these have not changed since Rhett's memo last year. 
 Approved. 
 Thanks for your notes.  Just so you know, I have the Polo Sport perfume and a Victoria's Secret gift certificate for Emily.  Were there lists for you and Dad?  I can't seem to find them. 
 My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think? 
 Maybe we can chat about this first draft this afternoon. 
 With my revisions. 
 This confirmation should have the regular Omnibus Annex A attached as well as the additional Chilean Annex which Tana forwarded last week.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Mark     Craig Breslau 12/13/2000 01:51 PM 
 In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a slightly revised version.  Also attached is a revised BETA.  The changes marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).  Unfortunately I didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked. 
 Bob:  Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere.  The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]  For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons).  Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot.  Mark    Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM 
 One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties. In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies - most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency regimes.  Just another item for your radar screen. 
 I'll be there! 
 One of the problems with Indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is involved, Reserve Bank of India approval is required in advance of the transaction.  A $US deal would involve foreign exchange from an Indian counterparty's point of view.  Certain transactions have pre-approved status but an ECT commodity swap is not one of them.  I'm still trying to track down whether a commodity deal can be done at all, even with RBI approval.   I've also asked whether, if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ECT, it might  be possible to use an Indian bank or other approved dealer as an intermediary.

 Brent:  Thanks very much for this report - these are VERY helpful in keeping me up to date on what's happening in your part of the world.  Mark 
 Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.  My suggestion would be that we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).  Of course, if he balks, we'll foot the bill. 
 Robert:  I believe that Sylvia Sauseda usually handles these matters.  Please let us both know the date you will be arriving with as much notice as possible so that we can have things ready for you.  We're looking forward to seeing you! 
 Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, insertions in bold).  Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any questions or comments:  A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts. SP:  What's a futures contract? A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a regulated  exchange. SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract? A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts.  The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not. SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery.  I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards? A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.  They are supposed to more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions.  It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract. SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad? A:  That's easy.  Because they look like futures contracts.  They are not intended to go to delivery.  And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC? A:  You've got it.  But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing.  So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option. SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract? A:  What do you mean? SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract? A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the hell out of my office!--  Is this the basic idea and if so,  how much can we blend physical into it to cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?  --Christian  Basically, yes.  A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also the parties' intentions.  If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to settle financially, we have a problem.  The closest thing we have to an exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to deliver.  That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.  We argue that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when there is a failure to make or take delivery.  Unfortunately, in the power world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.  However, each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.  The book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the book-out.  In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery (although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time). 
 I am also admitted in New York which has recently instituted a CLE requirement. 
 FYI 
 Marc,  I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.  Mark 
 Marc,  Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those copied on your note to me.  What do you think?  Marc,  We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.  Mark 
 Debbie:  I think we should probably do a special form for this particular transaction.  I've left a voice-mail to Marc to that effect.  There are several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should be covered in the L/C language.  Mark 
 In light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the field. We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.  It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.  Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung. Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.   You guys around this weekend? 
 We have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's Indian counsel but have not received it yet.  That's the reason I'd like to do a special form of L/C - we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw. 
 Marc - I know Bill well - give me a call (713)853-7459.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Hmmm, interesting question.  Most of the guys I've interviewed have gotten dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so it's hard to tell.  I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.  That department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you have a pretty good excuse.  It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be seeing.  The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is always in a suit & tie.  If you're also talking to him it might make sense to bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview. 
 Sorry for the delay - we won't be able to go with you tomorrow night - hope you have fun anyway!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Dan -  I left you a voice mail about this contract.  Can you let me know who the best person would be to review one of these for Brent?  Thanks,  Mark 
 The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American offices Mon. - Thurs. of next week but am in the office in Houston all of this week.  I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.  I have seen the issue addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.  The bottom line is usually that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the agreement.  Mark 
 Robert:  Actually, I will be out of the office Mon - Wed of next week.  Tana is expecting you and will be able to get you started on the swap training program.  You will probably need to give her name at the receptionist in the lobby - her extension is x33399.  If she isn't around, Jan Dobernecker (x33427) will at least be able to get you in the building.  Your office will be EB3847 and your phone number will be (713)853-6121.  Have a good flight!  Mark 
 Note Chicago - Hong Kong rtn for $475. 
 Nony:  I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you available?), from Buenos Aires.  Will we need to set up a conference call so that both London and B.A. can be connected?  It's also possible that Martin will be back in Oslo by then.  I'm not sure what his plans are re participating.  Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, I'm wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that area.  Since at least one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.  Mark 
 Marc,  According to Houston Sidewalk the game starts at 7:30 p.m.  Why don't we pick you up just before 7:00.  Let me know if that's a problem.  Mark 
 Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor lawyer we use).  Apparently there is some corporate policy against indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.   We'll keep you posted. 
 Marc,  The game starts at 7:30.  Why don't we stop by to pick you up at a little before 7:00.  Let me know if this presents any problems.  Mark 
 FYI 
 Carolina,  I have finally received my tickets.  I will arrive at Ezeiza on United Airlines flight #761 on Sunday, March 14 at 11:15 a.m.  Can you arrange to have a driver meet me at the airport?  I will be staying at the Sheraton. Thank you very much for your help.  Mark 
 I tried dialing 8-9-0-0- and 8-9-0 right after we finished talking and neither one works.  We'll have to keep hoping. 
 Thanks for your help - is Scott is in Houston today?  Maybe I could meet with him here.  Any chance he will be back in BA by Tuesday? (I am scheduled to leave Tuesday night.) 
 1. Jason Rose 2. Jason appeared intelligent and poised.  He was well prepared for his interview. 3. While Jason has some legal-related experience, I wonder if a second year student might not be a better catch for us.  If we don't have that as an option, I think Jason would be fine. 
 Thanks Nony - sounds good to me. 
 Here's the agreement with my changes (I think they show up in blue).  I changed the "permit' language and one date. 
 Justin -  How do we participate in the CEPI?  Are we providing prices to them?  Mark 
 FYI - I found this on the internet today:   =ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off  [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ? Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ]    By Axel Revheim  OSLO (Dow Jones)--Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't take off until certain structural blocks in the power industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB Financial Energy told Dow Jones this week.  ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. (ABBBY).  A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies are effectively hindering the development of free trade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of electricity and controlling the means of transmission, or grids.  Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impractical arrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said.  'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system price. You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot market. I can't see how they're going to solve this in Germany. They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg said.  Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are based on an underlying reference price, often an average of spot price throughout a region or country. There won't be any power derivatives trading in Germany before an acknowledged reference price is established, he said.  A Liberalized Market In Law Only  The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier to trading, Kollberg said. In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for example, independent producers are charged fees for access to grids based on an established point system. Producers pay the same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity is transported.  Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 1998, paves the way for all German consumers to choose who supplies them with electricity. However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a national reference price, few customers have, in reality, been able to move away from their regional supplier.  No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market for electricity sales. The first German electricity bourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or Leipzig. But interested parties such as the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can be introduced.  Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up with Germany's Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to establish a power exchange in Leipzig.  Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to develop a spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model.  There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices in the seven regions which are controlled by Germany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said.  'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said. The question isn't whether Germany will have a functioning spot market, but rather when, he said.  Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key  Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of vertical integration remains. One needs unbundling (between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg said.  According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power transmission lines are owned and controlled by the big German power producers.  As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg.  Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit of German consumers. however, because German producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic market from competition, observers said.  French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of electricity. According to Kollberg, there's an overcapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has an overcapacity of 31 TW. 
 I understand that Robin Jordan has taken care of this in my absence.  If you still need anything from me, please let me know.  Mark 
 I discussed this matter with Brent yesterday and I believe the correct title for Andrea is "Attorney". 
 FYI 
 Hey Bob -  Her name is Kartini Muljadi.  I haven't done a good job of staying in touch but the last numbers I have for her are:  Phone: 62-21-525-6968 Fax: 62-21-525-5561  If those don't work, you might check with Yao who has stayed in touch with one of the other lawyers in that firm.  He has moved over to Enron International where he is responsible for their African legal affairs.  I know he is out of town (in Africa) right now and unfortunately I'm not sure if his e-mail address has changed.  His phone number is the same - maybe his secretary could put you in touch with him.  Good luck!  Mark 
 P.S. - If you do get in touch with Kartini, please send her my regards.  I'm pretty sure she still likes me in spite of the way Skadden's relationship with her ended. 
 Is this something one of your people should look at? 
 Thanks Nony - looks good to me! 
 Scott:  What would you think about the week of April 19 for Tana's visit to London?  Mark 
 What travel dates did you have in mind?  I think you said you wanted to leave NY for London on the evening of the 16th (arriving Saturday morning), but when do you want to go to NY?  Let me know & I'll give Lillie a call. 
 FYI 
 Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate documentation for this transaction.  Sara - you should probably discuss with her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.  Brent may have some information as well.  Thanks,  Mark 
 Hey Marc - any chance you guys might like to join us on a one week sailing vacation in the Caribbean early next year (Feb or March)? 
 Anita:  I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can you refresh my recollection?  Mark 
 That schedule sounds good to me. 
 Looks good to me. 
 The Inn at Little Washington sounds great but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it this time.  However, as the geekiest among I consider it my duty to point out that since the millennium doesn't actually end until December 31, 2000, we do have next year!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Marcus:  I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call me once you get this note to discuss further.  The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the discussion.  I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues. 
 Oops.  Mine didn't go either.  I've now forwarded your message.  Here's Yao's new address:  Yao Apasu/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
 Looks good to me.  There is an airport in Burbank.  All the major airlines go there as well as Southwest. 
 Done 
 The alternatives are a net worth of US$1,000,000 or that all trades be guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements. 
 Is this for you? 
 Mark:  One issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange:  if there is no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions, who bears the liability when a third party defaults?  We certainly need to know if it is the exchange membership.  If not, how is the liability limited and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?  Mark 
 Justin:  The mention of Statoil made me think of Norway.  Alliance doesn't sound like a Norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here, but do you think we should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with Norwegian entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there?  Mark 
 Marcus -  Here is the note I sent on 3/31.  David Mitchell is definitely the right guy.  Mark 
 I have asked Russell to add you both to his distribution list. 
 Attached is a first draft of a statement of our policy concerning the termination of trading contracts on the bankruptcy of a counterparty.  Please give me the benefit of your comments and I will produce a further draft for Mark's review. 
 Buck:  Here's my list of things to do on the boat.  Let me know what you think we= =20 should work on first.  On Deck: Winch maintenance (someday I=01,d like to install a self tailing halyard w= inch) Inspect rig, adjust tension Some system needed to prevent jib sheets chafing on shrouds Check jib sheet cars Brightwork refinishing Cockpit drains should be checked for adequate flow - particularly those under the engine hatch Spreader boot needs to be reinstalled on starboard spreader Windex needs to be straightened/tightened  Electronics: VHF - check Depth Sounder - not reading consistently, odd read-out Wind Speed indicator - not registering Knot Meter - paddle wheel needs to be installed Loran - operating properly? Engine gauges - check ammeter, tach  Fresh Water System: Galley faucet not working (and sink drains very slowly) System should be disinfected Broken hose under sink in head  Check leaks around ports, probably rebed ports  Interior teak oiled  Stereo: Only working on one channel Install CD player 
 Sorry for the delay in getting this back to you.  Give me a call and we can discuss in more detail.  Mark  P.S. - have you been watching the Horatio Hornblower movies on A&E?    Christian Yoder 
 Scott:  I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these CFTC  issues.  I'll let you know how it goes.  I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in Houston.  I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.  Mark 
 Sorry about the previous message (re: bankruptcy legislation).  Please ignore. 
 Heather:  Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:  Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are: a. banks; b. non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and c. foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").  Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.  I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd be happy to send a copy on. 
 I put a call in to Cadwalader this afternoon to see if they had someone following these bills in DC........great minds! 
 Martin:  Mark H. has asked me to participate in another conference call scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Houston time tomorrow which will almost certainly last at least an hour and possibly more.  If you think 30 minutes will be enough, I wonder if we could reschedule our call for 8:30 (3:30 your time)? 
 As discussed. 
 Thank you both for the very quick turn-around.   Yes, I agree and hope that OM will consent to the proposed changes.  Mark T. 
 It worked!  Looking forwad to seeing you later this week.  Mark 
 Becky - I will be out of town on Thurs.  I may be able to participate from NY but my schedule is still up in the air.  Mark    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 It has worked fine for me so far.  I would prefer to continue to receive them by e-mail rather than have to go to the Intranet to get them.  Mark T. 
 Larry:  I'm not sure if you are the keeper of the Contact List, but since I received it from you I thought I should point out a couple of errors in the info. relative to me:  my fax number is 713-646-3490 my email address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com  Thanks  Mark 
 Looks good to me.  Mark 
 Taffy - would you please add these meetings to my calendar.  Thanks  Mark 
 Congratulations and well done to you and all the others who have worked on getting this agreement in place!  I know this was a long and difficult battle.  Mark 
 Hey Jeff:  I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.  I didn't realized you were at Mayer Brown.  I don't even know if we've talked since I left New York (almost 5 years ago).  I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital & Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal issues in derivatives trading here.  I don't get to Chicago often but if they ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!  C., F. & S.,  Mark 
 Dorice,  I was not expecting a letter from Crawford Bayley but I have dealt with them in the past so I suppose it is possible that the letter is intended for me. I have no objection to your opening the letter to determine its contents. You might wan t to wait a few days for the other Mark Taylor's reaction.  Mark 
 Dorice,  Please fax the bill to me at 713-646-3490 and just put the original in the regular interoffice mail.  My RC is 1157  Thanks for your help.  Mark 
 Hey Marc - I was in New Orleans last week, NYC & DC the week before.  Now back home & ready to relax a bit.  Hope you guys came through the storm ok this morning.  Our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled with downed tree branches.  I'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared out.  Ted got a ride from a friend and I took a cab.  Let's get together soon!  Mark 
 No trouble in N.O.  I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!  I just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.  T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out late enough to find out how much fun..... 
 FYI 
 Torrey:  I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX and monitoring our compliance with NYMEX position limits.  Phillipe Travis tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our positions with the option delta factored in.  Thanks very much for your assistance.  Mark 
 Wow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm damage will get me a new car!  How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want - 713-853-7459.  Mark 
 I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work done in Argentina.  Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in Brazil the same way?  I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.  Since it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these things.  Any thoughts? 
 Mark:  I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).  Many of the risks that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were close to meaningless.  If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) the widespread use of multiple "Omnibus" short-form contracts for trades before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign master agreements.  I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side in the contract negotiation/formation process.  That buy-in needs to be at all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from the top.  Mark T. 
 I will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 6:30 or 7:00.  Why don't you give me a call this afternoon - say around 3:00 or 3:30 & we can get together. 
 713-853-7459 
 Looks good to me.  Taffy, please add this to the calendar. 
 Tom:  I saw this on the Internet today:    ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS EDITORS/TECHNOLOGY WRITERS SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAY 11, 1999--ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S [Business Wire ? Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ]    BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN  ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line Trading of Bandwidth Derivatives  Business Editors/Technology Writers  SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the world's leading trading network for telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and options in telecommunications bandwidth later this month.  Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's access-controlled website where buyers and sellers can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening process for credit, documentation and interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, Booth No. 1004.  As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled derivative product that will allow anonymous web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs. Implementation of this product is an extension of Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)).  Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level playing field where even small operators can realize the pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future.  Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers) or speculators.  "Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti, vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. "As a non-proprietary player, we can offer impartial execution for our clients, which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this."  All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999. The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but currently not fully priced by telecommunications players.  "We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and founder, Arbinet. "Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which gives us complete objectivity in trade execution.  "This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom minutes on behalf of international and multinational telecommunications carriers."  For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com.  Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange and switch-based clearing network for global telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for international carriers in 1998, which it estimates represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies including Internet Telephony Service Providers and major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong.

 Sorry for the delay.  Here is a revised version of the certificate.  My proposed changes should show up marked when you open it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mark 
 Suzanne:  Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you know their t-shirt sizes.   Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please give the list to Dan.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know yet.  Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos Aires.  Tana will let you know which people in the London office will be coming. 
 Mark -  I think you are right - this is no doubt the best we can do.  Let's go ahead and take care of execution.  Thanks very much for all your help.  Mark 
 Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.  The guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why they're signing it.  Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?  I'm taking a few people to dinner & you might enjoy it.  Mark 
 What documents do we use for these deals?  Is it the German translation of our Industrial Master?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Scott:  It's great to see a senior commercial person take an interest in our issues! Any chance this can be videotaped so we can see it here?  Mark T. 
 I found this on our intranet site: 
 Just a note to let you know I will have to miss our meeting on Tuesday - I will not be back from New York until around noon. 
 Any chance you can think abot this a bit for our Monday meeting? 
 FYI 
 Janice:  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you - Elizabeth is now working in the power trading area and Sara has been out of town.  I agree with you that the letter seems harmless enough and I wouldn't blame the commercial folks for being upset if it looks like GS is trying to do and end-around on the process.  Yes - let's send it and get an opportunity to participate in offering the products.  Mark 
 Any seats left for the sushi demo?  If so, I'd like to attend. 
 Looks good to me. 
 Hey Buck -  How've you been?  I assume business has been good since I haven't heard from you lately.  Don't forget to send me a bill  for the work you did on the boat last month......  Mark 
 Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first of the year.   A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try to set up dinner again!    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Ken:  I thought you might be interested in the attachment.  Mark 
 Those should be paid like his regular expenses.  Please let me know if someone raises an objection.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 No problem. 
 Yes, I think that's how it's supposed to be.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I approved an access request for this that came through yesterday.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 FYI: One of our legal consultants has mentioned that another of his clients is setting up an internet derivatives trading system.  They are using an outfit called Intuitive Products International based in New York and London to assist with system design.  Tana Jones (x33399) will be setting up a demo by these folks with our legal department needs in mind - if you'd like to attend, we'd be happy to have you and ask them to expand their presentation to include internet trading. 
 I'm looking for an article that appeared on page 12 of the May 17 issue of Investment Dealers' Digest entitled "CFTC contacts Blackbird, which reignites debate." Mark Taylor 413/1157 
 Does the proposed reorg now contemplate that a US entity will act as principal for financial transactions? 
 Christian,  I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada.  The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's  when Nelson "broke the enemy line" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it's somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish. Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.  As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the "Risk Management Policy."  It most definitely covers Portland trading operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.  Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.  I don't have a current version but will ask Ted for one.  Mark    Christian Yoder 
 FYI:  Alex Mashinsky of ARBINET will be speaking on "Commoditising Telecoms: The Development of a Spot Market for International Telecoms Trading" at Risk99 in Boston June 8 & 9. 
 Cynthia:  As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks,  Mark 
 I will be in New York on Jun
