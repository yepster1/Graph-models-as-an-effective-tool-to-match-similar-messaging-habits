 In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:  The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911. These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code." From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code). From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code). I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.  It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.  Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459

 Nobody won on Wednesday so the jackpot is up to $33 million.  I'll get us some tickets for tomorrow's drawing.

 Thanks Sami.  It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.  It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.  Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out. 
 Joel:  Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?  Mark 
 Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.  Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

 David,  Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.  I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.  I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.  Mark 
 OK by me. 
 Do you have time to work on this? 
 I'll be there.  Large/0413/105657 
 Thanks Suzanne.  I'll take care of it and give RBS a call tomorrow.  Mark 
 EOL67313 WELCOME! 
 Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.  Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:  1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow? 2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power? 3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise? 4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements? 5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?  Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!  Mark

 Thanks for taking this one. 
 Sara:  How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.  Sorry for rambling.  Mark 
 FYI  Looks like we may get free passes to the boat show!

 Frank Sayre will be working on this matter while Cheryl is on vacation. 
 Sara:  I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  Scary, hunh?  Mark 
 FYI 
 I hope it was ok to respond to this - because I did. 
 I'm afraid I have a conflict that day. 
 Sure. 
 I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.  If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft. I'll let you know if it gets to that.  Otherwise I think we're under control.  Mark 
 Please arrange this for me. 
 I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.) 
 Since they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.  Tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for. 
 Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market. 
 Can you help Bryant with this?  Mary and Sara are both out tomorrow, Brent is supposed to get the form for the Commodity Logic matters finished and Francisco can't really take anything new until Monday.  I don't think Anne and Barbara have enough ISDA experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly.  If you are swamped, maybe you can get this started (I doubt if they even have credit approval yet) and somebody else can take it over next week. 
 This wasn't on my calendar - were you aware? 
  This one has sound so be careful..... 
 I have forwarded these on to Chris Long (who will get back to me on Monday) and left a message for Ken to let him know I will send it on to him as soon as Chris signs off. 
 Any idea where this stands?

 It appears this was handled by the Calgary office.  Greg Johnston will give you a call. 
 That's what I'm hoping, but if not Barbara said she would work on it. 
 FYI 
 I'm not sure which version this is but you'll no doubt be revising anyway. 
 Anne Koehler is probably the best person to talk to.  She has indicated she will have some time in the morning. 
 We've actually completed this as far as I know -- negotiated the agreement and signed it last week.

 yes 
 Do I have the receipts for these? 
 I have a friend who is an allergist but I'm not sure he's any good. If nobody else comes up with a suggestion I will be happy to give you his name. 
 OK by me. 
 To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, Tana can probably help. 
 I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.

 My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:   Bistro Mezzaluna Armadillo Cafe (Davie) Left Bank Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs) Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)  Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.

 I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.  Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places? 
   Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I was going through some old e-mails and found this one - is this something you have already handled? 
 Hi George.  I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  I was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read.  I'm living in Houston these days.  I was actually in London on 9/11.  My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.  I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.  I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.  Mark K. is in NYC.  I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.  I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.  I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  Hope you guys are doing well.  Mark 
 I agree with Susan that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in NYC and Houston that the ENA ISDA should be used.  Ms. Zivic had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people). 
 I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences. 
 Since I have to attend the Enron Net Works staff meetings Thursdays at noon, might it be possible to pick a different day? 
 Are you still taking care of the Portland guys?  Do you have time to look at this? 
 As long as this remains an internal only document, I do not have any problems with it. 
 Let's get together with Sara and Mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms. 
 I don't see why not. 
 Please see me before responding to Alan.  Thanks,  Mark 
 This is a swap confirm.  Do you have an option? 
 Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex. 
 I got another one. 
 Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours? 
 And another..... 
 Please check your records and make sure your e-mails intended for me are addressed to the correct Mark Taylor.  There are two of us here at Enron and the other Mark is getting some of your EOL approvals e-mails. 
 Stacey,  Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:  1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.) 2.  German Energy Markets 3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms  There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:  Christophe's panel discussion on new markets E-commerce panel  I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda. 
 The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the making of reservations for reward travel. 
 approved 
 Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:  Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?" 
 I spoke with Joe Collins (see below) this morning.  They are definitely thinking about the Commodity Exchange Act implications.  They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.  I gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction.

I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.  Mark

   February/March 2001 Issue  Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadb= and has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditisi= ng this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, p= urchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to= Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts we= re based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liqui= dated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from bei= ng a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from= a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of= contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingha= m, a senior trader at Enron. "When we sell the product to the customer we r= emain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind the= ir position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storag= e market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm del= ivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant develo= pment. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour di= scounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm deli= very," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participa= nts are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment = vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equip= ment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development o= pens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.   =09 
   Broadband Networking News  Mark Holmes 03/27/2001  Enron Hits Back Q= uickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications co= nglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electro= nics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid = to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entert= ain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electro= nics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental t= o Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enro= n after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announ= ced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies= for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yield= ed the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this excit= ing new on-demand service," explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of = Enron Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing,= but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtua= lly complete," notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warb= urg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of it= ems to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving tr= affic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly fr= om the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I woul= d suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggre= ssive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure o= f the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year = agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery= business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron= ," Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tell= s Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two a= nchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Elec= tronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the= importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network.= Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived f= rom its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to pro= vide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, a= llowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom= business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into= most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the conten= t delivery business will be successful," says Ray Niles, a utilities equity= analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The fact of the matter is they did get a= nother deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get = another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earni= ngs forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not ver= y successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast= for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is the= ir competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (f= rom Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yan= nello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It i= s disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other= deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably= the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  Enron, whi= ch produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various business= es, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbust= er deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannell= o says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $2= 5 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has ha= ppened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Block= buster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we= expand that $25 telecom valuation."   =09

 Chris - any chance you can show what the specific changes are? 
 I got your message and the e-mail.  I'll be happy to go pick them up.  Once I have them I'll let you know and we can arrange for you to get them. 
 Is there a call-in number for this meeting?  (I'll be in NYC.) 
 FYI 
 It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much= trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per = hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water go= t so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to= get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It= looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab si= nce some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the d= oor sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in bi= g trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I w= ould have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the seco= nd floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did com= e inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water= inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midni= ght the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no= standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all g= one.  Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the lo= op) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up = to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear = that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. = You missed a big one!

 Just wanted to let you know that I plan on attending the June 25 meeting along with Jonathan Marsh and perhaps one or two others from Enron. 
 I have your travelers Checks.  Are you mobile yet? 
 I have to agree.  It sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation.  If we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here, we should be willing to pay SOME kind of premium, even if it is fairly small. 
 I'm happy to take a look at the proposed language and coordinate with the lawyers in London and Singapore.  The difficulty in making the Long Description language the same around the world is that the underlying GTC's are necessarily different because they are governed by different laws.  We'll see what we can do. 
 Hope you had a good vacation.  Thanks for forwarding all of my mail.  Now that I've been migrated to Outlook it may actually get worse instead of better.  My assistant is trying to see if there isn't something the IT people can do. 
 FYI 
 While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance:  EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - Barbara Gray (x36832) Private e-marketplaces - Anne Koehler (x33488) Commodity Logic and hub issues - Mark Greenberg (x58897)  Tana Jones (x33399) may also be able to answer some questions, particularly relating to EnronOnline counterparty approvals, and is pretty good at tracking down the appropriate lawyer if you can't.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I have inserted my changes below. 
 I have left a lengthy voicemail for you with my comments -- the comments aren't that lengthy, just the voicemail.  Please call if you have any questions:  713-853-7459 - office 713-863-7190 - home 713-206-8080 - cell  or page me at 1-877-855-2081 
 Louise Kitchen has asked to be included and receive copies of our answers. 
 I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."  My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong? 
 I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there.  I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon.  I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them.  Don't worry if that's not possible.  I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock.  Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.? 
 If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers. 
 Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.  We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.  Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.  Mark  P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us. 
 We agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the EOL people to make sure that it works on the system.  I haven't heard back. 
 Dale -  I know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals.  We have asked Stephanie Panus, one of the other paralegals in the group, to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along.  Tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and I am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week.  Mark 
 Yes, I was working with Justin Boyd and Ian Brungs in the legal dept. I think they sent the revisions to Arfan. 
 Since we are not an FCM or an IB, I think we can let this one go. 
 looks fine to me 
 Rats - I thought I had picked a day when we were all going to be here - your day off was not listed on my group calendar.  Sorry! 
 Thanks Chris.  I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.  Bottom line, I don't think we will be advocating the MFA position. 
 Kelly:  Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:  Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.  The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.  I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.  On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!  I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.  Mark 
 I will not be able to attend. 
 We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  Janet Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions. 
 We should talk about this when you have a minute. 
 Requirements for Electronic Trading Facilities for Exempt Commodities  Transactions must be principal to principal (no brokers)  Parties must be Eligible Commercial Entities Same as Eligible Contract Participants ($10 mil. total assets or $1 mil. net worth) except: Must: have demonstrable ability to make or take delivery of the underlying commodity, or incur risks, in addition to price risk, related to the commodity, or be a dealer May not be a(n): investment company commodity pool employee benefit plan individual  The facility must: Register with the CFTC giving: Name, address, person to receive notices Commodity categories to be traded Certifications that: Executives meet certain qualifications The facility will comply with exemption conditions The facility will notify the CFTC of any changes in information provided Identity of any clearing organizations to be used Give the CFTC access to trading protocols and electronic access to the system Provide reports to the CFTC regarding executed transactions as requested by the CFTC Maintain records of all transactions and participants for 5 years and give the CFTC access to the records Publicly disseminate price, trading volume and other trading data as required by the CFTC On special request, deliver to the CFTC such other information as it may request  Transactions on such facilities are subject to the anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation jurisdiction of the CFTC 
 This is fine with me.  In the past, Dave wanted to see all of the ETA and PA amendments that we negotiated with EnronOnline users.  I take it these should go to you now.  If it comes to you from me, Leslie Hansen or Mark Greenberg, you can assume that Legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval.  Let us know if you no longer want to receive these. 
 Could one of you please take a look at the red-lined language in the attachment and let me know if it is ok to approve it.  Thanks! 
 I'm coming to New York this weekend and will be there until Tuesday.  Any chance we could get together for a drink while I'm in town?  Mark 
 FYI 
 Thanks -- I agree. 
 I have the pager with me but don't know if it's working.  Would you mind sending a test message?  Did you set up a lunch for me for tomorrow with David Mitchell?  It isn't on my calendar - or at least not the calendar I can access from the road.  Hope you had a good weekend!  Mark 
 Everyone I've talked to was thoroughly impressed.  I'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from Cheryl on Friday indicating she wanted to talk about it...not sure yet what that means.  I'm out of town today and tomorrow - if you have time to stop by Cheryl's office & ask, that might help.  My only concern with Kim at all is that she probably can't start until September.  Probably worth the wait though. 
 This is a test e-mail page. 
 Here is the list of the counterparties they want to put these agreements in place with and the lawyers that have been assigned to them.  As you can see there are a number that have yet to be assigned.  Would you please pass these out equitably among yourself, Frank, Mary and Francisco -- particularly those in town next week who will have a chance to move them forward.  Kim Theriot is very anxious that we make headway on these.  The counterparties marked with an asterisk are the most urgent.  I will forward the docs I have received from Stacy and Janet as separate e-mails.  Thanks!  Mark    Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I will be happy to attend. 
 I'm afraid I will have to be on the phone for this one. 
 Using your numbers: 1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to. 2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets. 3. Yes 4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules. 
 David -  Apologies for my silence.  I need to check with Mark H. and make sure he is still on board but I think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and schedule something for early September.  Mark 
 FYI 
 No problem. 
 This looks ok to me but I thought I should run it by you first.  Any objections? 
 As per my voice mail. 
 FYI - I will stick my head in today. 
 I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.  The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!  They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 looks good to me - do I need to approve this in the system? 
 Let's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can - that may not be until September but if she can make it sooner that would be great. 
 Here is the first of the no more confirms agreements.  Can you please handle this one?  Even though it came to me over two weeks ago I didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and EOL people called asking for it (entirely my fault) so there is a certain urgency to it.  I also have counterparties for Francisco, Sara and Frank to get started on, but I thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues. 
  Here is the Aquilla no-more-confirms agreement. 
 Have we been officially sanctioned by the LME?  If so, please send me a copy of any official statements of sanction. Depending on exactly what they say, we may have to report the situation to other exchanges here and possibly the CFTC.  Thanks!  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Here is the no-more-confirms document I mentioned. 
  here it is 
 Here is the first of the no-more-confirms agreements.  Power and Gas have already made their changes to the form so now it's our turn.  Sara, Mary and Francisco also have counterparties they are working on.

  FYI 
 Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.  At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.  I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.  The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable. 
 I asked for a return date for you of September 12 which is the day I'm coming back.  But since I will be going to Houston and you will be going to NYC we won't be traveling together anyway.  Would you rather stay an extra day or two? 
 Will you guys be around the first weekend in August?  I have to be in nyc the 1st & 2nd on business - thought I'd check and see what you were up to.  Mark  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Here are my comments: 
 Better check with Stacy to make sure they are done with this one. 
 Your reservations went through on the card you wanted.  I asked for 9/12 as your return date and 9/26 as Amanda's.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 Veronica,  The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.  Mark 
 Let's plan on it.  My only question is whether I'll be able to come on Friday eve. or have to wait until Sat. a.m.  Do you have plans that would make one day better than the other?  I have a 4:00 flight back to Houston on Sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the Newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me. 
 Tom Gros and the Commodity Logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so.  The demos are scheduled for 1:30 to 2:30 and 3:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon in EB5C2.  Please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I already have a meeting scheduled at 11 on Monday. 
  If this doesn't work, I can just send you the three whole presentations.  Let me know.  Mark 
 Unfortunately, it's each one comes from a different presentation -- here are all three: Slide 3 Slide 9 Value Proposition Slide 31 
 Here is the language for the risk control slide.  Sorry I can't send it to you as a slide but what they sent me was actually 31 slides that Ken and I've distilled down to one.   Enron Risk Assessment and Control (RAC)  Market Risk Management Policy approved by Board of Directors Trading Limits Value at Risk daily reports -- stress testing Application of Extreme Value Theory  Credit Risk Management Counterparty credit exposure aggregation and management Counterparty Value at Risk models  Segregation of Duties; Independence of RAC optimizes focus on risk identification and performance measurement 
 I marked my comments on the document and left it in your office.

 ISDA's interview is on Wednesday afternoon.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 How did it go? 
 Our agreements with EnronOnline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties (i.e. non-Enron companies).  We can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products, but can not give the lists to anyone else.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
  FYI 
 We do know which companies use the system.  I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.  My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number. 
 Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get away even close to on time?  Thanks again!  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I'll let you guys decide who takes first crack at this one. 
 A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on. 
 Sure - just send me the numbers -- or maybe a website or two.  We run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time.

 Sorry for the delay.  I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00? 
 Sorry for the delay -- these look fine to me. 
 Can you add yourself to my rolodex? 
 This came from the EOL info web site as it is.  Maybe the PowerPoint experts can go there to get a better version? 
 Do you know anything about this? 
 Joel --  I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you. 
 I've checked with Alan and I think Mike R. is probably the right guy all the way around. 
 Here's another which Janet hasn't seen yet.

 Hi Justin -- I'm afraid I don't really know what this is all about.  It sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing.  Can you fill me in? 
 I think it would be a good idea if you would print these out when you get them and bring them in at some point so we can go over them. 
 Oops.  Sorry, I'll bring them by. 
 That's fine with me - I've booked it.  Just let me know if you need to change the time. 
 Janette -- would you please revise Mark's group list to delete Mark A Taylo= r and add me as Mark E Taylor?  Thanks! 
 Wow -- you must really get in early!  Thanks for forwarding these things.  = I've asked Janette to revise her distribution list.  Mark 
 I think Holly talked the e-mail gods into making the change a month or so a= go.

 Yes, that makes sense to me. 
 Please print these out for me and put them in the Commodity Logic file. 
 Good catch!  I was thinking that Thanksgiving was the 29th -- oops.  I'll get a revised quote.  Any ideas for who wants to go?  This particular boat has three cabins and heads.  If we have another person (Jim?) or couple (the Johns?) we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive.  And if there are even more, we could get a larger boat with four cabins.  We just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved.

 I was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail. All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.  There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.

 I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.  I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:  Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.  Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.  The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:  'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'  If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

 I seem to remember that we talked about you doing Anne's review.  I hope it's not just wishful thinking.  Here is the form for her.    Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services (713)853-7459 
 I would like to attend. 
 Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?  Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?

 This is the current incarnation of project offline.  They are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of EOL for them.  I think Anne has been the point person for them.  It is not related to the back office deal. 
 Marie -- I'm afraid I don't have anything on physical bandwidth at all.  It might make sense to check with the lawyers in EBS -- I would suggest you start with Cynthia Harkness and Robbi Rossi. 
 1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.  3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them. 
 For future reference, please do not send schedules like this to the entire group.  I'd rather these go out one by one.

 We're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.  I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.  I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time." 
 Are you guys working on this already? 
 I have found a couple of other people who are interested in going, but tonight is Ted's last night in town before moving to Ft. Lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game.  Just let me know.

 I'm in London today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in Houston on Thursday.  Since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.  But if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.

 Are we sending drafts by e-mail?  I can imagine we probably are.  If so, let's run a test by sending a real draft to one of us internally to open and see if there is a metadata problem. 
 Create Limit Order Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.  You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.  *Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.   _____  [m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression. [m2]This is the key! - we are changing our price, not showing their price.

 As we discussed. 
 Fertilizers brochure - final text file 2001  [Cover]  FERTILIZERS  It's time to manage your price risk. Logo [Spread 1] Managing Price Risk For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows. Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products. [Spread 2] Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business  The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure. [Spread 3]  SWAPS  Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed. The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party. [Spread 4]  Swap: Producer example  AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target. [chart 1]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread. ?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.  [Spread 5]  Swap: End-user example  FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales. [chart 2]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:  ?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices. ?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia. ?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron. ?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton. ?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.  [Spread 6]  CAPS & FLOORS  Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential. With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements. [Spread 7]  Cap: End-User example  CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay. To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked. The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton. [chart 3]  DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:  ?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices. ?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap. ?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock. ?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap. ?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.  [Spread 8]  Floor: Producer example  AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time. To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton). [chart 4]   EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:  ?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices. ?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor. ?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium. ?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium. ?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

 Can you take a quick look at this? 
 FYI 
 One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that in as a "service"? 
 Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees? 
 I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.  I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.  I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.  I'll be in touch.

 I think he's asking the wrong question.  Can you help him out? 
 Would one of you please give me a call in my office.  I can't get through on Stuart's cell.  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street - EB3892 Houston, Texas 77008 (713)853-7459 (713)646-3490 (fax) 
 These documents need to have the correct directors names added so they can be signed first thing in the morning. 
 Holly said you had been trying to reach me.  I've tried to call several times but still haven't been able to get through to you on the phone. I tired to send this yesterday but it may not have gotten through. 
 These are the good ones. 
 Just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like I'll be able to make it to NY this weekend as previously planned.  I'll let you know if that changes.  Mark 
 Thanks David -- I appreciate that.  I'm thinking when this all calms down, I'll just take a couple of days off and come up to the city for fun -- not wait for a business trip.  I'll give you a ring if anything really interesting comes up. 
 Yes, we might as well get one. 
 John Lavorato, Mark Haedicke and Mike McConnell 
 That's what he goes by. 
 Thanks for the offer.  At this moment, looks like I'm not going to make it at all, much less tonight.  I'll let you know if that changes, I'm proceeding minute to minute here. 
 Thanks for your message.  Is there a number where I can call you?  Mark Taylor Vice President and General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street - EB3892 Houston, Texas 77008 (713)853-7459 (713)646-3490 (fax) 
 Thanks for your note.  We're hanging in there. 
 I can get the NETCO document signed but don't know anything about CGNN.  Who should I give that to? 
 I'm in London.  I had a 2 week vacation planned with Bill in Greece but he is unable to join me so I think we'll do that another time.  Are you in London?  Germany?  If so do you want company?  Call me at 020 7491 7282, suite 18 or 020 7881 500 471 or reply to this e-mail and Mark will get a message to me. 
 I honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed.  I expect these are part of other efforts where I am not on the "need to know" list.  If you know another Enron lawyer involved in those efforts I suggest you try them. 
 Net Works is not a marketing affiliate.  We can make changes if they want us to. 
 Thanks for the note -- not to worry about the music.  I didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway.  Thanks for the thought.  It's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch.  Mark

 Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.  It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.  It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.  Tell Don I said Hi.  Mark 
 I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?  On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.  Mark 
 Please give me a call about this - I'm not sure it makes sense to say that the index varies each day. 
 Thanks for your note.  I am stranded in London and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and I can get a seat.  Looks like that means Sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me, too on Friday night. 
 Sorry about that.  I have been a bit preoccupied.  I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.  It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.  You should have them tomorrow. 
 Here are the documents we discussed.

 I think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for - just be very careful to try and minimize expenses. 
 A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):  1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict? 2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).

 Thanks for that, Tim.  I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the Marshall Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.

 I'm fine.  I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.  Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.  If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.  It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.  Hope you are doing ok through all this.  I'm just sort of numb.  Mark 
 I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.  How do we convince customers to participate? Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.  New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.  Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.   Issues:  Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts. Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate? Might make more sense where no current positions exist.  Contract hurdles:  Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default. Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC. May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).  If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?  It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)  Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

 Adam,  Are you in today or this week?  Mike 
 We had a group meeting this morning.  Pretty interesting! 
 He is looking at it right now.  Oh, by the way, we had a group meeting this morning with George. 
 Maybe we might win then. 
 A few things.  - Mainly next week this floor will not be in high spirits.  The layoffs will be next week.  EGM and EIM will be hit  	  hard - John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks - etc. 
 Paul,  Can we get a breakdown of how much Enron gives to soccer and what does it pay for? 
 Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned "that they are good at being number 2."  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  George did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.  Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM.  Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!

 I think he looked at the preso and maybe 25% of the b-plan.  We did not talk about it, yet.  He said it looked good, but he got bored so he stopped reading.  He may be waiting for you to come back in town to discuss.  I told him you would be back Monday.  That is the latest. 
 I understand.  I am not the one holding you up.  I printed out both documents for him to read.  John doesn't take commands from me.  I will make any revisions he has made on his printed copies tomorrow. 
 I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any. 
 Do you want me to go to this?  I was planning on going.  Lisa called me today. 
 I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  If none are out, I think we should call and tell him. 
 I put it in my original message below.  It is 832-496-0123.  Tom Hartman with San Joaquin Power. I imagine a natural.  Are you going to call him today? 
 Just to keep up good relations.  I told him we would get back with him.  Please let me know if you do not call him. 
 I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting.  The meeting was good. But you will be retired before that program is worth anything as far as a good trading program is concerned.  John, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if John gives me anything to add I will.  I am going home (LA) tomorrow so I might work half a day. 
 John, I got a six hour drive tomorrow, so I was thinking of taking a half day, so I can spend a little more time with my mom.  Any objections?  Your emissions analyst 
 Who says that John Massey is not a nice guy? 
 From what I have heard, this looks pretty good.  But I wonder if paragraph 1(c) is correct.  Is this what was agreed or should this refer to any spread transaction including a NYMEX, COMEX or Platt's price and another price (whether one of those 3 or not)?  And finally, I don't understand the penultimate paragraph at all but since you guys are closer to the discussions it may make sense to you.  Can you guys confirm this with the traders and report our comments and/or agreement to ISDA?  Thanks!  Mark 
 I am doing her thing on Saturday in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Kind of a compromise.  My thing Thursday.  John told me to take off as early as I want tomorrow for the drive.  So I think I shall.  I called my boy at San Joaquin. 
 I told him those ERCs on website were being sold.  We are looking into another deal (bullshit)so we will keep in touch if something comes up.  Price was not brought up. 
 Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

 While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.  I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.  If so, you may care about this.  My impression is that the Houston commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let Sara Shackleton or Barbara Gray know as soon as possible. 
 I put your $500 check on your bed.  Nice ZERO points this week.  Do you not want the $630?  I only pulled a 5.  Really hurts me.  But mathematical I still have a chance.

 Mary or Lisa,  How does the agreement with EEA work?  Do we pay there a specified amount each month or do they charge per hour?  Please advise.  Thanks, Mike 
 Trevor,  This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago.  Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.  Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?    Mike Taylor 
 FYI . . .  Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA  >> Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be calculated right now because they will depend on how many banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are pretty much in that range. <<
