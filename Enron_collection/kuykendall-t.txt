 october preliminary invoice: 
 Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted every time the word "Topock" appears.  We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would also have to change the description of the original index product as well.  I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

 so sorry to hear about your loss.  our thoughts will be with you. 
 without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can. 
 please add Astra Power LLC to the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products.  thank you. 
 hey kristi -- the bunko is going to be on april 9th at my house.  hope to see you there. 
 hey sheri -- i forgot my logon and password for dynegy direct -- we havent looked at it in so long but now we want to again. 
 SORRY - I was out when i normally do this and i forgot about it. 
 hey heath -- sorry it took so long to get back to you -- we plan on at least going to dinner -- dont know how long we'll stay out after that -- i'll do my best.  See you there. 
 Here is the resume we talked about:    - Resume 2.doc 
 here are the two new index descriptions that we need:  For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top   Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."  We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help. 
 hey girl -- havent talked to you in a while.  just wanted to catch up and see whats new. 
 i will be attending 
 nasdaq is scary!  you think we could lose another 30% of what we have in there??  should we just leave it in for the long term and wear all the pain now? 
 you should see me try to play golf right now - it is downright comical. 
 i still cannot see the blanco physical index restricted products on the web. my ID is ADM44643.  can you please get me access as soon as possible. thanks. 
 i got ahold of them and they are going to stop by the house tomorrow and look at everything and give us an estimate 
 here's the right email address.  talk to you soon. 
 hey jack -- sorry i missed your call the other night -- i've either been out or exhausted every night.  this whole pregnancy thing is really tiring. anyway, i just wanted to get back to you - i'll try to call soon -- didnt want you to think i was ignoring you. 
 I have a friend who is possibly interested in the trading positions that we have open, but I wanted to find out exactly what types of trading positions they are.  CAn you give me some more details?  thanks.

 hey - looks like feb 23 would be my preference if thats available.  thanks so much . 
 I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume. He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off myself.  Thanks again. 
 Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks! 
 i show -.05 in my notes as well as on the paper ticket 
 I'm glad everything worked out for you.  Hope you have a great time! 
 Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there. 
 The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help. 
 We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away. Please let me know what I need to do. 
 I need to add some more people to our restricted list for our blanco product, but i need someone from eol to send me an update of the current list.  Can I get this today?  Thanks. 
 i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love you!  tori 
 I'm so glad you wrote back.  Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?  I have been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet? How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years? That makes me feel old!  I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought! Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call first - my number is 281-578-9135.  P.S. -- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest friends and she says "HI." 
 Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see what's going on with you.  Write back if you can. 
 I'd like a swatch of Seaside Baby.  My mailing address is  4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX 77450 
 Oh - i forgot to mention - John Perdew wants your body. 
 Hi Amber.  I have misplaced my truequote ID and password and I would like to start looking at the system (finally).  Is there any way you could send me my info again?  Thanks, Tori. 
 WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March. I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun planning the wedding! 
 hey - just wanted to see hoe your trip went - i dont even know if you're back yet. 
 Hey Sean!  I just thought about you yesterday because I remembered your birthday was coming up.  I have no idea if this is the correct email address for you, so I won't write too much.  Write back if you can - I have alot to tell you. 
 hey fletch - i was wondering if you had any access to bbq cookoff tickets for the enron tent this weekend.  i have a friend coming in from new york and he really wants to swing by there.  let me know.  thanks 
 hey jake - we arent going to be able to make it tonight, but thanks for the invite.  had fun sat night!  see ya soon. 
 phillip is a buyer of calpine - CPN - you wanna check into that? 
 that sounds awesome - dont catch any dangerous diseases.  do you know scott thompson at southern?  if you do, i heard he has connections in south africa.  i probably wont talk to you again before you leave so - have a great time.  i wanna hear all about it when you get back.  take care. 
 well - sounds like you had a great birthday!  whats your next stop?  still florida?? 
 hey - just wanted to say happy birthday!  and, find out how you're doing - perfect i'm sure.  you would totally laugh if you saw me right now - i'm starting to look pretty darn preggo.  anyway - i may try to call you later today.  take care. 
 maybe - what do you think? 
 I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status of the printer?  Thanks. 
 we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon 
 we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and they will be reinvoicing us. 
 hey brook - i was wondering if you sent that check - because if you did - i didnt get it- no big deal - just checking 
 thats awesome!  i'm so happy for him! - what day is your actual birthday - i always forget the exact date. 
 hey girl - you guys doing anything tonight? 
 just confirmed with mike - we are still good with that offer. 
 just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby - due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her. anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing back from ya. 
 I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay? 
 these charges are not valid  - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a constrained point.  several people on the desk discussed this potential problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not intend on paying any penalty charges.  this deal was done on a gtc - spot contract, not on their firm agreement. 
 thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco restricted product.  i am still getting complaints from people who should have access, but they are telling me that they do not.  thank you.

 We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as possible.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for having the league.  I'd definitely do it again next year.  Here's my address -        4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX  77450

 Here you go!  Happy New Year! 
 the current bid for jan-june for the west texas pool gas would be HSC-.06. this bid should be right on the market according to what i have found. please feel free to check around if you'd like, but i will need an answer today if you want be to start pulling gas on the 4th.  thanks. 
 I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address is: 4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX 77450 I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the next email! Take Care and Happy Holidays!   Love, Tori 
 I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori (Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me an email - let's catch up. 
 can you also add :National Fuel Marketing Company.  thanks. 
 hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe $145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for making the semi-finals?

 hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born -- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so "hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.

 i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan before we actually lock this thing up.  we are still going to do it, but we both feel better about having both names on the documents.  can you tell me exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working? 
 still on for lunch today?? 
 Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past. This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 oh - ok --  she hasnt said anything but that doesnt surprise me -- she is actually the manager of the group and she usually doesnt talk much about her interviews -- i'll see what i can find out. 
 i talked to steve and he liked you alot -- who else did you talk to?? 
 thanks so much - i am going to write her in addition to sending the invitation since it looks like she wont be in town anyway. 
 hey there.  i was wondering if you have nicole's address.  i wanted to get terra to send her a baby shower invitation just in case she might be coming into town, or at least it will serve as an announcement anyway.  thanks.

 do you not have instant messenger at work anymore?? 
 river trip sounded like a blast!  the pool is going well - next step is the deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 weeks.  pat got a job  - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be working downtown at waste management.  it was a pretty good offer -- good benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he had at bank united.  we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care center -- that was a big relief.  so -- things continue to fall into place -- we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues... 
 hey there - i was just talking about you with my mom - she said she talked to you again today and i was laughing that she's talked to you alot more than i have lately!  dinner friday sounds great.  what else have you been up to?? did you already have the river trip??  we havent been out at all -- just too tiring for me to do anything but dinner right now.  we're just trying to get everything ready -- it's pretty exhausting.  well - i better get back to work -- talk to you soon and see you friday! 
 for deal 694859 -- it should be 4.48  for deal 697646 -- for the 30-31 it should be 4.50 
 we all have the same address but different work station locations - let me get them for you --  our street address is 1400 Smith Houston, TX 77002  here are the work locations:  Tori  EB3208C Randy  EB3208D Patti  EB3208E Kelli  EB3235B  Hope that helps. 
 thursday sounds great -- and around 1130 would be good if you can make it -- we can go to bourays, ny pizzeria, allen center -- whatever you want. 
 just seeing if you were back from your trip.  maybe we can go for lunch sometime this week. let me know when you're free. 
 looks good 
 we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.         Tori,  Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.  Their address is now correct.  As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades detailed below.   Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.   Trades to Cancel: ----------------- Confirm Date  Agent Buyer Agent Seller Therms ------- ----- ----- ---- ------ ------- 4/25/01 2640 A116 2527 2527  445,730 4/25/01 2640 A116 2587 2587  444,270    To confirm that you agree to cancel, then please forward this to him at gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree.   (You can also hit "REPLY ALL" since I cc'd on this email).   I will call you and let you know what the new downstream contract will be.   Thanks  Parks Wesson Astra Power, LLC pwesson@astraoil.com 
 hey there.  just wanted to see how the bike ride went.  also wanted to let you know that pat got a job. thank goodness.  anyway, write back or call when you get a chance. 
 hey there.  just wanted to see how the bike ride went.  also wanted to let you know that pat got a job. thank goodness.  anyway, write back or call when you get a chance. 
 We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks. 
 lets start on the 30th -- monday -- that way we can start it for may 1st trades. 
 the trader over there is JB Smith.  if you would like - you can send me a copy of the invoice, and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached - and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the issure to be resolved. 
 wow - thats awesome - have a great time -- bring pictures to the baby shower -- you should be getting an invitation soon -- i think my friend jennifer is sending them out early next week.  i cant believe i only have 7 weeks left! 
 damn  - we eat really early here - they bring lunch at 11 oclock if you can believe it.  maybe i will come meet you anyway and not eat - it's dead here today.  when and where were you planning on going?? 
 i am not in risk - can you get with anne bike and explain what you need her to do?  thanks. 
 Hi.  I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the new day care center.  I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether or not we have been accepted.  I know the center doesn't open until September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line something up if I do not get in.  Also , do you know an exact date for the scheduled opening?  Thanks for your help. 
 i need to send jennifer a shower invitation and i have your address but i lost the zip code - duh.  can you forward me your zip code?? 
 hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted products?  let me know... 
 can you just let me know one way or the other if his background would be compatible with anything that might come up?  thanks. 
 thanks 
 hey dan - it's tori from the good ole west gas desk.  i was talking to the klapper the other day and he said that i might be able to forward my hubby's resume to you to see if you knew of any good fits for his experience in your arena.  his background is in ecommerce account management/development and other IT consulting and auditing.  i'm gonna go ahead and attach his resume. please let me know if you think there's anything here for him - i would greatly appreciate the help.    thanks,  tori 
 hope everyone is okay with this -- i talked to the people that were here and we all agreed. 
 not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple. 
 hey - thats funny about john - he definitely remembers him - i'll call pat and let him know - we are coming on saturday - i just havent had a chance to call you guys back --  looking forward to it -- i probably need the directions again though 
 i will be here all this week and really any time after about 10 am is fine to stop by 
 Looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current product and create a new one also 
 Hello - I was the one who asked about your high chair covers at Fuzzy's pizza the other night.  I was wondering if i could get more information on patterns and cost.  Thank you. 
 i never heard back on this request -- was it done?? 
 you are so sweet to think of me.  i dont know why you would ever be in houston, but if you are, we definitely need to get together.  talk to you soon. 
 what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the drinks.  i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we will need at least one extra person.  it looks like everyone that was there last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming. we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all the kids. 
 hey there!  hope everything is going great with you.  things are still going pretty smoothly with me - thank goodness.  my actual due date is 6/11 so i only have about 2 months left.  i'm starting to realize why people are always miserable in the last couple of months.  anyway - my address is 4419 Stackstone Ln.     Katy, TX 77450.  Talk to you soon. 
 hey beverly -- do you have phone numbers for any of the people that werent there last time?? 
 This is just to remind everyone that bunko is at my house on Monday April 9th.  Please let me know as soon as you can if you are not going to be able to make it.  Thanks and I look forward to seeing all of you there. 
 scott and i talked and we cannot say definitively that triad called us first every single day -- there may have been some days when we called them.  we can call you if you need further explanation. 
  Hey Keith.  It was great catching up last night.  In response to our conversation, although I have already sent me resume there through a head hunter, I thought I would also forward it to you directly.  I'd love to have lunch with you in the near future to talk about the prospects. 
 so far - i guess its a good thing you didnt get on here after all 
 if everyone wants to go - we definitely have to bring the baby -- be we are open to that for sure 
 we have a meeting at 3 today -- cnbc is doing a report at 3:50 -- i will let you know 
 we would also like to keep all files under g:\west desk\gas reports and matt lenhart needs to keep a file on his h: drive called "matt-pl" 
 so - here's the synopsis - everything is business as usual - we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100% - we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours - it's going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company. 
 ok - let me know when you guys can try to come up with a solution.  also, mike would like to know if eol can work on a new functionality that would allow a trader to create a fixed price physical product that could link to price, basis, and index i
