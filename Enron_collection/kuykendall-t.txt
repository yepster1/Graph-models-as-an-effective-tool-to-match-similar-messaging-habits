 october preliminary invoice: 
 Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted every time the word "Topock" appears.  We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would also have to change the description of the original index product as well.  I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

 so sorry to hear about your loss.  our thoughts will be with you. 
 without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can. 
 please add Astra Power LLC to the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products.  thank you. 
 hey kristi -- the bunko is going to be on april 9th at my house.  hope to see you there. 
 hey sheri -- i forgot my logon and password for dynegy direct -- we havent looked at it in so long but now we want to again. 
 SORRY - I was out when i normally do this and i forgot about it. 
 hey heath -- sorry it took so long to get back to you -- we plan on at least going to dinner -- dont know how long we'll stay out after that -- i'll do my best.  See you there. 
 Here is the resume we talked about:    - Resume 2.doc 
 here are the two new index descriptions that we need:  For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top   Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."  We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help. 
 hey girl -- havent talked to you in a while.  just wanted to catch up and see whats new. 
 i will be attending 
 nasdaq is scary!  you think we could lose another 30% of what we have in there??  should we just leave it in for the long term and wear all the pain now? 
 you should see me try to play golf right now - it is downright comical. 
 i still cannot see the blanco physical index restricted products on the web. my ID is ADM44643.  can you please get me access as soon as possible. thanks. 
 i got ahold of them and they are going to stop by the house tomorrow and look at everything and give us an estimate 
 here's the right email address.  talk to you soon. 
 hey jack -- sorry i missed your call the other night -- i've either been out or exhausted every night.  this whole pregnancy thing is really tiring. anyway, i just wanted to get back to you - i'll try to call soon -- didnt want you to think i was ignoring you. 
 I have a friend who is possibly interested in the trading positions that we have open, but I wanted to find out exactly what types of trading positions they are.  CAn you give me some more details?  thanks.

 hey - looks like feb 23 would be my preference if thats available.  thanks so much . 
 I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume. He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off myself.  Thanks again. 
 Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks! 
 i show -.05 in my notes as well as on the paper ticket 
 I'm glad everything worked out for you.  Hope you have a great time! 
 Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there. 
 The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help. 
 We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away. Please let me know what I need to do. 
 I need to add some more people to our restricted list for our blanco product, but i need someone from eol to send me an update of the current list.  Can I get this today?  Thanks. 
 i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love you!  tori 
 I'm so glad you wrote back.  Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?  I have been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet? How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years? That makes me feel old!  I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought! Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call first - my number is 281-578-9135.  P.S. -- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest friends and she says "HI." 
 Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see what's going on with you.  Write back if you can. 
 I'd like a swatch of Seaside Baby.  My mailing address is  4419 Stackstone Ln. Katy, TX 77450 
 Oh - i forgot to mention - John Perdew wants your body. 
 Hi Amber.  I have misplaced my truequote ID and password and I would like to start looking at the system (finally).  Is there any way you could send me my info again?  Thanks, Tori. 
 WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March. I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun planning the wedding! 
 hey - just wanted to see hoe your trip went - i dont even know if you're back yet. 
 Hey Sean!  I just thought about you yesterday because I remembered your birthday was coming up.  I have no idea if this is the correct email address for you, so I won't write too much.  Write back if you can - I have alot to tell you. 
 hey fletch - i was wondering if you had any access to bbq cookoff tickets for the enron tent this weekend.  i have a friend coming in from new york and he really wants to swing by there.  let me know.  thanks 
 hey jake - we arent going to be able to make it tonight, but thanks for the invite.  had fun sat night!  see ya soon. 
 phillip is a buyer of calpine - CPN - you wanna check into that? 
 that sounds awesome - dont catch any dangerous diseases.  do you know scott thompson at southern?  if you do, i heard he has connections in south africa.  i probably wont talk to you again before you leave so - have a great time.  i wanna hear all about it when you get back.  take care. 
 well - sounds like you had a great birthday!  whats your next stop?  still florida?? 
 hey - just wanted to say happy birthday!  and, find out how you're doing - perfect i'm sure.  you would totally laugh if you saw me right now - i'm starting to look pretty darn preggo.  anyway - i may try to call you later today.  take care. 
 maybe - what do you think? 
 I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status of the printer?  Thanks. 
 we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon 
 we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and they will be reinvoicing us. 
 hey brook - i was wondering if you sent that check - because if you did - i didnt get it- no big deal - just checking 
 thats awesome!  i'm so happy for him! - what day is your actual birthday - i always forget the exact date. 
 hey girl - you guys doing anything tonight? 
 just confirmed with mike - we are still good with that offer. 
 just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby - due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her. anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing back from ya. 
 I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay? 
 these charges are not valid  - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a constrained point.  several people on the desk discussed this potential problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not intend on paying any penalty charges.  this deal was done on a gtc - spot contract, not on their firm agreement. 
 thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco restricted product.  i am still getting complaints from people who should have access, but they are telling me that they do not.  thank you.
