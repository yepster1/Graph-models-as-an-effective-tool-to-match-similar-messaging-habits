 You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.  I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of November.  -Eric

 He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.  If not, he is applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.  I think he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am waiting to hear about that.

 Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical.      Enron North America Corp. 
 Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.  Eric    Enron North America Corp.

 Thanks for your help.  There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.

 Dan,  I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language? Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones.  I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.   Thanks in advance.  Sincerely,  Eric Bass x3-0977

 no i haven't driven by yet.  i would like to see the mandell house again before putting a contract in on it.  -e 
 I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low ball contract). This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.  Let me know when you are available to see more houses.  I am free whenever, except for Saturday after around 4 pm.  L, E

 too complicated    Enron Capital Management 
 So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 4:30 - 5).  Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else. 
 i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is actually better than them.  see below 
 i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.  get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same next year.  lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.  but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team. 
 Oh yeah, and by the way here are the rankings . . .  http://louisianastate.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=40&p=58&sp=1

 I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help.  -E  To whom it may concern:  I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time. It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight. I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.  For your research I provide the following data: Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna Husser, and Donnita Franklin.  Final Itinerary (after all changes) - Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM  Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM  Sincerely,  Eric Bass 
 Do you have the original flight information on our flight out of houston?  Thanks

 Hey Mom,  Can you send me the flight numbers for the America West debacle we just experienced?  Thanks 
 Mike,  I haven't heard anything, so I am assuming that the tourney is off. I do, however, still have the money that I collected for UT.  I would still like to turn the money in.  Who should I direct it to.  Thanks,  Eric

 Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off. Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we will be playing for the National Championship next year.  How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?  Later-  Eric

 Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.  I am excited because I haven't experienced real winter like conditions for 3 years. Have you been skiing before?  -Eric

 Updated plays.  I have copied both sheets on 1 page (front and back). 
 I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.   What do you think?

 Hey Paul,  I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game (2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are more open. you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.  what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow? 
 Hey Dad,  Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery.  What is the skinny?  Is this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed?  How are things otherwise?  Love,  -e

 I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs. I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).  Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let me know.  Let me know what you think.  Hook 'Em! -Eric

 here is a template for some plays - it might be helpful to have a list of plays to show during the game

 A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much does the quality of the high end amp matter?  Thanks 
 SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip." So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:  1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12. 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10. 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. 7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook. 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. 10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T." 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not say, Eat me" 12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry," 13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. 14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.   The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money. Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.

 Hey Michael,  I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on that team.  Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the championship.  Hook 'em.  Eric x3-0977 
 To whom it may concern:  In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.  My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament?   Thanks in advance,   Eric Bass x3-0977

 Gary,  We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target.
