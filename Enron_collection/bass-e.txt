 You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.  I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of November.  -Eric

 He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.  If not, he is applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.  I think he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am waiting to hear about that.

 Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical.      Enron North America Corp. 
 Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.  Eric    Enron North America Corp.

 Thanks for your help.  There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.

 Dan,  I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language? Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones.  I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.   Thanks in advance.  Sincerely,  Eric Bass x3-0977

 no i haven't driven by yet.  i would like to see the mandell house again before putting a contract in on it.  -e 
 I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low ball contract). This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.  Let me know when you are available to see more houses.  I am free whenever, except for Saturday after around 4 pm.  L, E

 too complicated    Enron Capital Management 
 So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 4:30 - 5).  Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else. 
 i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is actually better than them.  see below 
 i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.  get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same next year.  lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.  but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team. 
 Oh yeah, and by the way here are the rankings . . .  http://louisianastate.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=40&p=58&sp=1

 I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help.  -E  To whom it may concern:  I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time. It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight. I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.  For your research I provide the following data: Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna Husser, and Donnita Franklin.  Final Itinerary (after all changes) - Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM  Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM  Sincerely,  Eric Bass

 Hey Mom,  Can you send me the flight numbers for the America West debacle we just experienced?  Thanks

 Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off. Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we will be playing for the National Championship next year.  How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?  Later-  Eric

 Hey Paul,  I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game (2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are more open. you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.  what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow?

 I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs. I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).  Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let me know.  Let me know what you think.  Hook 'Em! -Eric

 A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp.

 SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip." So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:  1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12. 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10. 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. 7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook. 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. 10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T." 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not say, Eat me" 12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry," 13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. 14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.   The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money. Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.

 To whom it may concern:  In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.  My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament?   Thanks in advance,   Eric Bass x3-0977

 Gary,  We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target.

 What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.  -E

 I found something that New Orleans has to offer that Houston doesn't . . .  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/09/26/school.shooting.03/index.html 
 and i will throw in beasley 
 you never responded to my last offer - Taylor and Anderson or Watters for Garner and Freeman? 
 Horn for M. Anderson  You are short WRs 
 no, sorry 
 $0 bid for darrell jackson 
 yeah, try to be there on time - preferably 6:30 - b/c we only have eight people 
 Our game tonight is at 7:00.  Please try to make it by 6:30.  As of now we have eight people.  Tim - can you see if Micah can play again?

 Are you going to make tomorrow? 
 our game is at 7:00 tomorrow - can you make it? 
 your choice of anderson or watters   and  taylor 
 touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good all year. My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.  Let me know 
 alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring back in the league) will still be there. 
 George has no value after last weeks games - I will give you garner and toomer for taylor 
 Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez? 
 Matt has a win and Harry a loss.  They tied but the win goes to the one with the most reserve points. 
 yeah, just come by my desk.  i have it for you. 
 Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.  Do you want to go?  -Eric 
 Alright, you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him? 
 here, woman! 
 Let me know whether or not you can make it to the game on Wednesday @7. 
 Anyone up for half price pizza tonight, say around 7:45?  And yes, I am a fat ass!  Let me know.

 If you want to pick up a player - you need to let me know by today - b/c I will be on vacation tomorrow. 
 Did we ever decide on the whether to change to the owner's club or not? 
 that bid won't be there next week :( 
 have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!  Let me know 
 walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.  now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters, anderson or george?  I need to know fairly quickly 
 alright then anderson rather than watters 
 what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters? 
 Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack? 
 713-853-0977 
 yeah i will be there  who all is going to sierra and what time? 
 see the bottom for directions 
 just to let you know - s. davis is worth much more than taylor and m. robinson is worth much more than george (even if george is starting).  garner and toomer for taylor 
 that's great! what do you want for taylor? 
 what do you want for taylor? 
 $2 bid for Marcus Pollard 
 please take me out of my bid for kennison 
  Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback Sept. 19, 2000 By Len Pasquarelli SportsLine.com Senior Writer     Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed.  "If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."   Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP)  In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games.  A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change.  One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis.  The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 yards per catch this season.  But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter.  "There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else." 
 i think i can scrounge one up    Enron North America Corp. 
 By the way, wear your grey "HEAT" jerseys to the game and bring a blue t-shirt as an extra. 
 we have at least 8 
 can you make reservations for 7:00 at beef and bird?  thanks, e 
 I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop. Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of pride. 
 We have a game tonight at 7:00.  Please try to make it to the field by 6:30.   -Eric 
 $1 bid for Bjornson $0 bid for greg clark

 that is fine, as long as you know how to find it.  did you make reservations for dinner yet? 
 Come on man- you need help?  I am willing to talk receiver and RB swaps 
 Hey Gillette,  The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to supply you with some of the guidelines.  -Bass

 Hey Aunt Bonnie,  I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.  Love,  Eric 
 Do you know if you are going to make it yet? 
 Thanks Harry.  I appreciate the recognition.  Eric

 Brett,  Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare time on your hands. Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times (lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking. Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  Where are you currently stationed?  Drop me a line next time you come to houston?  -out 
 So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better way).  Let me know  -E

So, if you want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.  Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.  Let me know 
 I just though you would be interested in knowing that the UT game that you are going to will be at 6 pm.  http://www.texassports.com/fbo/fbc/2000schedule.html

 you have to like garcia against carolina over brunell against balt or bledsoe against njy ...  don't you? 
 How about Garcia and Bettis for Brunell? 
 So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made to me on October 18th, 2001).

 alright, no williams  can i interest you in a receiver and say lamar smith for robert smith or ron dayne 
 so basically what you are saying is that had you had the 3rd pick in the draft you would have taken r williams    Enron Capital Management 
 just out of curiousity, would you do stephen davis for ricky williams straight up?    Enron Capital Management 
 did she try your patience?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Stephen Davis, Terry Glenn and Bill Schroeder for Williams, Moss, and Travis Taylor? 
 are you irritated?    Enron North America Corp. 
 beside - stephen davis is better than terrell 
 i dont have dillon any more 
 that is all i wanted to hear 
 you don't even have a 3rd receiver, johnson is out with a bum hamstring 
 your receivers are terrible - i am trying to help you out! 
 Garner and Glenn for T.D. ? 
 Would you take Terry Glenn and Charlie Garner for Fred Taylor? 
 Terry Glenn and Charlie Garner for Eddie George? 
 Charlie Garner, Terry Glenn, and Donovan Mcnabb for Marshall Faulk 
 that is pretty gay 
 that is fine with me, but what about shanna, she might be a little uncomfortable with just the 3 of us

 thats really bad! 
 what are you trying to show me?  this just sends me to the ap website 
 Mother,  I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.  Both you and Dad replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious and there was no timeframe on its completion.  You know that I love you and Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your implication with your last comment).  If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to remember that my brother and I are different people.  You cannot neccessarily associate his actions with mine.  Please take that into consideration.  I love you very much,  Eric 
 you tell me that you are cheating on me . . . .  interesting    Enron North America Corp. 
 I sent that file to you in error. Please disregard.   Thanks,  Eric 
 check this out on my offer of schroeder and harris for engram 
 some people are idiots 
 i am still willing to do that side bet if you want 
 ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package?  how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade that i think is fair for my team  let me know what you think 
 didnt i just make you an offer for connell?  you are not going to get both dillon and davis  so if you have to have both of them tell me so i can back out now  but the trade i offered you is fair 
 alright i would do davis,schroeder, and harris, for faulk and connell 
 jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent , they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got suspended.  if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.  so let me know 
 faulk and mccaffrey for lamar smith, davis and chrebet or schroeder  you desperately need depth at rb - lamar smith is solid 
 i took the vote down, we will only vote on trades later in the year 
 i could do wayne chrebet, stephen davis, and raymont harris for faulk and mccaffrey 
 we had said we were going to vote on trades. we have had our first trade. some people have come to me requesting a vote   please go to the website and vote on the trade between the the Lie Downs and the Rounders 
 Raymont Harris, bill schroeder and wayne chrebet for smith 
 counter then 
 corey dillon, raymont harris, and bill schroeder for faulk,  let me know what you think or if you have a counter 
 some people are dumb asses 
 i will give you schroeder and raymont harris.  that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb.  by the way engram was drafted in the eight round, so was harris, and schroeder was drafted in the 10th  that is an 8 and a 10 for 8 
 check this out  another example of how ridiculous people are 
 engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i might add) for a backup WR.  the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have a pretty good year.  by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.  so don't give me any of that 
 your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th best rb for the 30th receiver? 
 oh, because i was going to offer up stephen davis, but never mind ... 
 What do you want for Fred Taylor? 
 for Kevin Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, and Bill Schroeder? 
 What Do you want for Engram? 
 Hey Mom,   The x-rays were negative, and i haven't heard about the review yet.  how is everything on your front?  love,  e 
 Hear anything on Engram? 
 What is your offer on marcus robinson? 
 Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne Chrebet?   Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play week 1 and maybe 2).  Let me know 
 What do you want for Fred Taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 weeks? 
 Please take time to answer a new poll on the website! 
 Alright,  I think this is a good deal for you! You get Depth at Receiver and Depth at Running Back.  Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith  FOR  Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith  What do you think?    Enron Capital Management 
 any counter?    Enron Capital Management 
 What do you think?  chrebet,dillon 
 How about Raymont, Bill Schroeder and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman? 
 we will make it effective today so that, you can't stockpile players 
 Your running backs suck.  I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman. 
 I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for free agents until the start of the season.  If you disagree, let me know.  The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have no more than 17 players on your roster at any time. 
 since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better record than you this year 
 i thought we decided that was during the season - up until the season starts it is free. 
 your team is so bad 
 so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo 
 What do you want for Randy Moss? 
 i repeat, uou have no offer? 
 so, there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for, i find that hard to believe 
 i will give you walls and terrence wilkins 
 What do you want for tony gonzalez?

 By popular vote, we will not redraw.  Our draft will take place, this Sunday at 11:45 am at BW-3 in Rice Village.

 Matt told me he is going to draft an lsu player with the first pick - Eddie Kennison 
 alright, no more memos about bw3 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative. matt, you won't be there, so your input is worthless bryan, two rows isn't conducive to big groups, so pick some place else. 
 by popular vote, the draft will take place at noon on 8/20 at BW-3 in rice village. 
 We are going to have the draft on 8/20.  However, we still need to decide where and at what time.  I would prefer to have the draft around noon.  We can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the internet).  Please let me know ASAP.  -Eric

 Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board off of a nearby fence, wedges it down the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving his friend's life.  A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL" he starts writing in his notebook.  "But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies. "Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed you were."  The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."  The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."  "Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."  The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."  The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."  "Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you root for?" the reporter asked.  "Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.  The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20 representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h= e=20 wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20 matter how well-meaning the fans might be.  "I don't want to be rude," he said last week. "I just wish they'd stop=20 asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ..."  Got the picture.  OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu= le.  Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba= ck=20 Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20 Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we= ek  This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu= t=20 from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen= =20 Hardin.  Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.  Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range= =20 when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.= =20 During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20 sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few= =20 football games are played under water.

"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20 because he wanted to be challenged," Hardin said. "It was a challenge to co= me=20 up with things to challenge him."  "The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm= =20 up," Applewhite said. "I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo= r=20 six minutes instead of five."  After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based= =20 more on conventional wisdom than necessity.  "I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it," he said. "I don't= =20 have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason."  In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of= =20 which being a renewed appreciation for the game.  "So what if I'm tired?" he said. "I can rest when I die."

"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that= =20 it felt like my arm was run ragged," he said.  Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20 takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,= =20 will take a little longer.  Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?  "I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris," Hardin said of his=20 occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational= =20 ploy. "But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever."  "It's remarkable the way he's come back," said sophomore cornerback Roderic= k=20 Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the= =20 speediest receivers in workouts. "In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight."  Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,= =20 Babers said, "I think (Simms) has the advantage.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback= =20 duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a= =20 month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no= t=20 competing against Simms, just against himself.  "The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20 have," Applewhite said.

"To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20 sport. There's nothing you can do about it."

 you realize that who plove takes is irrelevant b/c your are going to take the best player available at either slot.  It is what you think you can make up with the additional picks.  besides, both of us are at equal risk to who plove picks 
 My 1,4,and 6 for your 1, 5,7 
 My 1,4,and 6 for your 1, 5,7 
 So, what you got? 
 Am I going to be able to get these out on the website today?  Eric 
 I offered you my 1 and 3 for your 1 and 4.  I can throw in my 5 for your 6.  Let me know.  Eric 
 hey mom,  things are going well.  not much new though.  how are you?  i am planning on moving but probably to an apartment in the river oaks area.  -e 
 I would like to trade for your 2nd pick in the draft.  I can offer you a 2nd round pick and a 9th round pick.  What do you think?  Eric 
 I will give you my 3rd and 9th round picks for your 2nd.  Let me know. 
 You're right. We cheated by trying to screw everyone who isn't fortunate enough to work at Enron.  Give it a rest.  The order was determined by an impartial 3rd party. 
 1st, and 10th 
 Here it is.  1. Dave Baumbach 2. Matt Lenhart 3. Bryan Hull 4. Mick Walters 5. O'neal Winfree 6. Hector/Lenny/Brian 7. Eric Bass 8. Harry Bucalo 9. Jason Bass 10. Phillip Love 11. Ramiro 12. Gary Lamphier 
 it will probably be today sometime 
 By unanimous vote we will pre-determine the draft order.  So, if nobidy has any objections, I will pick the draft order here at work under the scrutinhy of several other players ( Dave B, O. Winfree, M. Lenhart, M. Walters).  Also, by majority vote, will have a required tight end posn.  Meaning the starting lineups will include 1QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def.   Please e-mail back if you are ok with me picking the draft order.  Eric 
 Here is the analysis that I completed.  Let me know if you have questions.  Eric     Enron North America Corp. 
 Just in case you were interested.  Here is some of the correspondence that is going on. 
 Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?  Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior to the draft.  I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan and trade your picks.  Let me know.  Eric 
 Check out this link, and then read the story below. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=000625542412043&rtmo=aq4CTWTJ&atmo=99999999&p g=/et/00/4/20/nmar20.html    WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION  Where We're Headed By Robert A. Waters ****************************************************************  You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door.  Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers. At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way.  With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.  In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a weapon--it looks like a crowbar.  When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor. One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside.  As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless. Yours was never registered.  Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died. They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm.  When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter. "What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask. "Only ten-to-twelve years," he replies, as if that's nothing. "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."  The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous times. But the next day's headline says it all: "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die." The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type pranksters.  As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media picks it up, then the international media.  The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.  The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you've been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.  A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man.  It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.  The judge sentences you to life in prison.  __________________________________________  This case really happened.  *********************************** On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England, killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term.  How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the once-great British Empire?  It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns. Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.  Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead.  The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle.)  Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school.  For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns. The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens.  During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We cannot have people take the law into their own hands."  All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars.  When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities. Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn't comply.  Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns from private citizens.  How did the authorities know who had handguns?  The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.  Sound familiar?

 By popular vote, we will have a draft instead of an auction and the draft will take place on 8/20.  Rules to follow.  Eric 
 We have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for acquiring players.  Please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links to the auction ( I think it is Auctions A-Z) and let me know which option you think is better. 
 i told you so! 
 The new draft date is 8/20 by overwhelming majority.  Stay tuned for further details. 
 Hector,  I invitate you touch my big, beautiful, American breasts! 
 There are some conflicts with the draft date, so we will probably need to have it on a different date.  Please tell me if you prefer 9/2 ( the day before the season starts) or 8/20.  We could also do it during the week, but it will probably takle 3 or 4 hrs.  Let me know suggestions. 
 what day is good for you? 
 don't worry about it 
 im thinking perfect storm 
 It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.  Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, too early, too late. If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year. You all do not stand a chance!  -Eric 
 i think this is a call for help.  maybe you should provide with some service tonight? 
 by the way we are going to see either the patriot or the perfect storm tonight - so decide! 
 hey, long time no hear! how have you been? how was the trip?  i had fantastic time on my cruise. unfortunately, i got back on sunday and it was straight to work on monday.  i'm assuming you didn't take up permanent residence in Belize, so, if you didn't, drop me a line.   -e

 Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.  I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this PRC?  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Eric Bass x3-0977

 I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation. The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important. The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., natural gas, coal, etc.)  Do you have this information?  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977

 You're done,  Hale is starting on Sat.  LSU doesn't stand a chance! http://www.ncaabaseball.com/news/bbo/bbc/2000/06/08/960520710439.html 
 you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about the EES bullshit.  if it bothers you that much then say something about it. as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.  i know that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.  i was just trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's lead.  and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought up the cfa.  i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.  so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat. 
 You had to hit below the belt.  We were having a friendly shit talking contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.  What's up with that? 
 I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.  I would hate to have to come to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.  I guess I just had this opportunity fall in my lap because I never have added the kind of value that you did while in risk or EES.  I guess that is why I got offered a promotion to stay and you were sent packing to Enron Siberia.  P.S. Shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend, maybe you can hook up! 
 It may not be rocket science, but not everyone can hack it.  Isn't that why you left the wholesale side of the business?  Besides somebody has to take up the slack for EES.  Let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your loss for the quarter, I'm sure I can spare some out of my book! 
 I don't need to talk shit about the game.  I will let the Longhorns do the talking for me on Saturday.  By the way,  you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now. 
 let me know if you want me to bring something.  love e 
 we will make but won't be there till around 6:30 ish

By Andy Katz ESPN.com  With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.  NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several projections we'll have on ESPN.com.  A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing in Chicago.  The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.  Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what happens.  ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.     Chris Mihm  Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.  1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.  2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.  3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward (which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door open for a return.  4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.  5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.  6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard.  7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.  8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.  9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.  10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season.  11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much different.  12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in Chicago -- if he shows.  13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness.  14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.  15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the Pacers.  16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind Cleaves.  17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.  18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.  19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.  20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first round, regardless of where he's being picked.  21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural pick for the Raptors.  22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.  23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first round.  24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the Bulls some versatility on the floor.  25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.  26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.  27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers have a history of going younger in the draft.  28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many miles left in his legs.  29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.  Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN.com.  ?

 Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month ( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)  In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you check into this and get back to him?  Thanks,  Eric     Enron Capital Management

 I really just need historical throughput, especially third party, to the major market areas.  I am going to analyze this data from a temperature correlation perspective to see if we can use weather derivatives to hedge throughput exposure.

 We need these locations set up to trade financial products for now.  We will be trading physical at Carthage but firmness is not a problem there.  Agua Dulce firmness may be a problem for physical, but as of now we are only going to trade it financially.     Dale Neuner   05/01/2000 09:43 AM 
 Dale,  On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC.   In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.  Thanks for your help.

 i bet you score over 200! 
 Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

 Thanks for the information.  We are using it to try to get a sense of the increase in demand created by this new generation.  I have cross referenced some of your info with some info from the power desk.  this info is attached.  In addition, it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you mentioned below.

 Melissa,  As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly "accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.  January-  Total Accrual Value = $266,504  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid = $105,000 Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000) Total Value =                                   $148,750  February-  Total Accrual Value = $289,305  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid = $100,000 Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000) Total Value =                                   $177,000  March -  Total Accrual Value = $292,145  Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid = $106,000 Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000) Total Value =                                   $172,000  Let me know if you have any questions.

 What I am really looking for is a way to save monthly production data by county for the entire state for all of the data.  Unfortunately, saving the data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time.  Thanks for your help.  Eric Bass

Eric  Enron North America Corp. 
 No.  I went last year and it was more packed than on a regular day. 
 We have a game tonight at 6:45.  Please try to be there by 6:30.  Let me know whether or not you will be at the game.  Eric 
 I don't think 5:15 is a great time for us, but don't let us keep you from going to the show.  If you want to go to the early show, we won't be offended.  We can do something another time.  We would love to do something with you if you decide against the 5:15 show. 
 Melissa,  Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo. I will follow up with these specific details.   Eric 
 Melissa,  Here are the accrual values for Q1.  More details to follow.  Jan - $266,504 Feb- $289,305 Mar - $292,145  Eric    Enron North America Corp. 
 That sounds good.  We will be there! 
 There is not enough data on it to make an educated decision.  It looks like they have the backing of an I-bank to place some more stock so that is somewhat encouraging.  You are going to have to make your own call on this one.  If you like the idea and you think they can execute, then go for it. 
 Jill,  I was wondering if I could get some information on the Costilla deal, specifically the repurchase option.  I need to know the term, locations, volume and strike price of the call.   Thanks,   Eric x3-0977 
 i will go 
 What do I look like - a key map?  Take Allen Parkway to Shepherd.  Make a right on Shepherd and a quick left on Memorial.  Follow Memorial all the way to the park.  I don't know which side you will play on b/c both sides have fields. 
 Hey,  I tried to call you.  I need Brandi's Work #, Home # and Social Security #.  E 
 Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value. 60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.  For example:  Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.  This means that:  Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000  Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)  Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been previously recognized. Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.   Call with questions.  Eric x3-0977 
 Did you make your reservation? 
 The new product will be a day product like our current Katy and HSC Pool products, so it will be a fixed price product for next day gas delivered at the Corpus location.   Call with questions.  x3-0977   Dale Neuner   04/03/2000 04:35 PM 
 what's up with the migraines? that is two weekends in a row!  the concert was good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear black ballon and name - so i was happy.   i felt sick this weekend too - so mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.  I did get to go to a game at my new field (Enron).  It is a great place to see a ballgame.  You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and the Astrodome.  I left early on Friday b/c I am a shooter :)  The Fam is great and Jason has not found a new job yet.  Phew! I think I got all of them (the questions, that is).  -e 
 I don't know.  I haven't heard anything.  You might want to talk to superfan ( aka  Chad) 
 Dale,  The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.  We already have a baseload Index Corpus product.  We need to create a DAY Corpus product with the same parameters as this baseload product.   Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?  Thanks,  Eric 
 Tonight's game has been cancelled 
 Hey  I just got your msg from friday.  I left at around three.  How was your weekend?  Did you make it to earth day?  Talk to you later. 
 I don't know the YMCA's policy on rain outs so  I will assume that we still have a game tonight.  Our game is at 7:45 tonight.  Please let me know if you will be there.   Eric 
 Thought you might find this interesting! 
 I will play if the street thug doesn't 
 It doen't matter to me. 
 I would like to sign up for the lottery for all four days.   Thanks,  Eric    Enron North America Corp. 
 sorry 
 FYI 
 Dale,  Ed Gottlob would like to set up a meeting with all of the necessary counterparties in order to discuss this product.  Can you find out when a good time would be?   Thanks,  Eric   Dale Neuner   03/28/2000 10:56 AM 
 Dale,  Have you heard anything more on the 5 X 24s?  We would like to get this product out ASAP.   Thanks,  Eric 
 no, we are fine 
 FYI 
 Our first flag football game is tonight! Are you in? 
 Please try to make it tonight by 7:45 to go over some things. 
 The game is at 8:45 at the Post Oak YMCA.  The Post Oak YMCA is outside the loop at the corner of San Felipe and Augusta.  We have eight as of now, so make sure and let me know if you can't make it for any reason. 
 We have seven as of now.  If you want to play, you will play the whole game.  Let me know. 
 Will you be able to make it to the game tonight?  It is at 8:45 at the Post Oak YMCA.  Let me know.   Eric 
 The game is at 8:45 on Monday@ the Post Oak YMCA.  Let me know if you can make it. 
 Our first game of the new season will be Monday night.  I do not have the time yet, but will let you know.  Please let me know if you are still interested in playing and whether you will be available Monday or not.   Thanks,  Eric 
 last again... 
 Hey Lisa,  Long time no hear!  I guess you are too cool for all of us little people now.  Brenda is looking for someone to fill Bryan Hull's spot in risk when he leaves.  I know that you are looking for a rotation, so I was wondering if you have an interest.  Let me know.   Eric 
 Yea.  I will be there.  What time again? 
 i'm getting really freaking tired of being last on your e-mail lists! 
 What the fuck is up with that? 
 aren't we presumptious.  of course i want to see you tonight.  but i have to work out before coming over!  what are you making me for dinner?  and do you want me to bring over a movie?  and, by the way, you have my permission to go to your little crawfish boil on sat. e 
 Have you heard anything on the sitara issues?  Thanks,   Eric 
 Luis,  I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in early April.  So, I will try to schedule a practice.  Let me know when you are back.  Eric 
 i will go if you want me to - does that sound familiar? 
 do you want me to go? 
 Dolores,  I have signed up for the CFA exam in June.  Who do I need to talk to to get a reimbursement?   Thanks,  Eric 
 what sounds good. next week or thurs? 
 I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.  I don't think you can make a case that you were smart for betting me without the points.  That's like me saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am confident that it is going to 90.  That's real smart.  No wonder EES loses money!    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sorry about the headache.  I hear that slamming your head against the wall is good for getting rid of migraines.  Oh wait that's what I do at work to help me think about something other than losing lots of money - never mind.  Thurs is probably best then - if not then maybe next week. e 
 i  have his marathon pictures up as wallpaper on my computer.  he is so sexy with his shirt off.  did you have a good weekend?  do you still want to get togehter after work sometime this week?  lemme know 
 how was the well this weekend?    Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI.  There might be some back office issues with this. 
 Everything is working.  Thanks for the help.   Eric 
 Market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in the wellhead portfolio.  I do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead portfolio.  However, I do not see a problem with the market deals unless they were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders).  -EB    Enron North America Corp. 
 Here is my bracket.  I will bring the money down around 10:30. 
 When is graduation?  And, of course I will show up.  Although, if I recall, you didn't show up for mine! You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006. I haven't heard of the advertising firm.  What kind of projects do they work on?   I am going to Earth Day. Are you?  Are you bringing Rebecca again this year? We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. Patty's day.  What about you?  e 
 Things are going well here.  I have been pretty busy losing lots of money at work. Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the month, but I can't go because of work.  It doesn't bother me that much though.   I will probably try to take a trip over there in May.  On top of that I am thinking about a cruise this summer some time. Brian and I are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the Park at Midtown.  Brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony, so we are going to move to an interior apartment.  Of course, I wouldn't expect you to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment.  Oh well, I guess you have your priorities.  Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  How are things with you and the fam?  e 
 Phil,  Can you provide me with the most recent Entex Deferral Balance?   Thanks

 brutal! 
 I guess that feeling is similar to the one you get whenever you are around me.  You just don't know what to say. 
 we won both games, of course.  i was 3-6 with a double off the fence - and you missed it!  One guy on our team hit a home run in back-back at bats.

 Hey Brett,  Not too much going on in H-town.  I just recently started trading Natural Gas Futures.  I have had three heart attacks, a stroke, and have bitten off all of my fingers in a week.

 whatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do. but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!! so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....

 supposedly i have "reversible airway disease" which is not asthma but similar.  they have given me an inhaler and some claritin (for allergies).   i haven't been able to find anything on the internet about it though. 
 what do you want for eddie? 
 moulds for alstott? 
 Rika,  Here are the user names that you requested for the ERCOT website:  dbaumba, ebass, vweldon, tmartin, molsen2, gbryan, mlarubb.    Thanks,  Eric 
 alright what do you want for warrick dunn? 
 ok alstott and troy brown for holt? 
 not my fault - like i knew that jamal was going to blow out his knee - i didn't offer terrell davis.  what do you want for torry? 
 torry holt? 
 that sounds great.  i am always interested in a free meal.  friday night is probably better for us if you guys want to come into town.  if not, then saturday is fine.  -e 
 no . . . you are going to go dancing with me! 
 hey sheila, thanks for the invite. my mom's b-day is this friday as well.  i still don't know if we are taking her out on friday or saturday.  so we will try to make it.  we stayed at the marriot at the capital last year in austin.  -eric 
 hey mom, thanks for the info. tough break for rush.  i was sorry to hear about that.  things are going well.  just kind of slow.  i have my asthma test today - it is called a pulmonary function test.  what do you want to do for your birthday.  do you want ot get together on friday or saturday and where?  let me know  L - Eric 
 sorry no tkts. it was a good game though 
 he told me that he wasn't sure if he would be in town.  i guess there is no need to have two. so i won't have one then

 Happy B-day punk!  How old are you now? 30?  Oh well, I guess we will see ya tonight.  I don't think you are at work today but if you are shoot me a line.   -Eric

 hey dad,  austin was fun.  michael ballases and i went up for the day and met up with his family b/c it was parent's weekend.  it was good to see them again.  i am anxious to see how we play against OU.  i am starting to have a good feeling about this team. they looked really sharp on saturday - especially the offense.  shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday. i don't know what time yet but it should be around 6:30.  see ya then

 Here is our detail for October.  Unfortunately we are unable to provide you with blanket counterparty level detail on our transactions due to legal issues.  However, just as last month, if you have specific questions on any location or transaction, we can examine those on a case by case basis.  Thank you. 
 When does the next league start and who is it run by (i.e. city, YMCA, etc.)?  Thanks,  Eric

 what do you want for antonio freeman? 
 right now i guess we have 6 - i have not heard back from boone.  val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then.  i didn't have mitch's e-mail so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull.  i guess we could have about 10 people.  what do you think? 
 good call guys.  i am not sure but i believe that i signed contract with you guys that double indemnified me from loss - prior to payment  let me know when i can pickup my check for $8000.

 tom brady - bishop was cut a long time ago 
 they think bledaoe will be back in 2-3 three weeks.  no injuries to internal organs ( that is what they were concerned about) 
 did you get a chance to look at anything last night? 
 volumes are still down - i have no clue on the merger. you hear something new each day 
 do you have any big 12 tkts? 
 i am just kidding - just giving you a hard time.  i think i am going to sit this one out anyways.  that was a tough loss for you guys 
 <http://www.har.com/search/condo/indexdetail.cfm?MLNUM=518049>  this one has 4.5% financing 
 hey. long time no hear. how is everything going with you? how is the family doing?  Eric 
 my family is doing really well.  jason is getting married in february in fairfield.  he seems very happy.  things are a little sketchy at enron right now with the debacle that has occured, but everything should work out for the best.  don't worry about all of that stuff, you can do what you please with it.  eric 
 i thought you were back in houston for good as of the last time we talked (8 mos. ago)?  did you leave after that?  where are you working now?  i will relay your msg to jason  eric 
 where are you working now - i know you worked for that motorcycle company - do you still work there?  jason's fiancee (sorry no fancy accent) had been a friend of his for awhile. They started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 6-7 months ago.  She is very nice and we get along just fine. Thanksgiving was good - I stayed out at the the parents house for a couple of days and went up to college station on friday for the game.  How about you? Glad to hear that Lucky is well. 
 Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know. 
 that sounds good 9 it is.  we will go for beers regardless 
 Hey Brett, What's been happening?  I hope you didn't buy any enron!  It is looking good for the Horns.  It seems like fate is on their side.  Every week we get closer to a Rose Bowl berth.  If we get to the Rose Bowl I will have a ticket with your name on it if you can get away.  Are you going to be able to catch the game this weekend?  BTW, are you still in Hawaii?  Hope all is well.  Your Pal,  Eric 
 what is your commission? 
 then you are done 
 sounds like a good job. i am glad you are enjoying it.  i haven't taken any big vacations lately, mostly to austin.  i did go to new orleans for a wedding recently but other than that nothing.  the girls sound like they are well.  tell them i said "hi".  good talking to you -e 
 I was thinking of having a get together at my place but I wanted to gauge interest first.  Let me know if you are interested.  I will send out another e-mail if I get enough responses.   -Eric 
 go ahead and buy on that news.  you know its going to be bullish!!! 
 whatever you think - just let me know 
 thought you might enjoy 
 Also, in bankruptcy, who is the first to be paid? Specifically, are employees first in line?  Thanks 
 http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/pages/releases/006/112701_02.html 
 thanks for the offer.  i think some guys at work are going to get drinks today.  you are welcome to join if you like.  if not, i will take a rain check on your offer. 
 Tom (my boss) does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus, but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down.  He did, however, tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by Enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company.  What do you think?  _Eric 
 Hey Brett,  Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at Enron.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money. Oh well, things will work out.  As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the Rose Bowl this year).  The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).  If either one loses (Miami at Virginia Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.  Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.  This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.  Good luck on the proposal.  You are about to venture to the Dark Side.  Telluride should be fun.  We went there last year for a ski trip (again).  I might be venturing down that path soon.  I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).  Take Care.  Eric 
 I don't have your work #.  What is it? 
 hey dad, baxter was the ceo of enron north america at one time.  he was regarded as one of the founders of the wholesale trading business.  he resigned in may. whenever i see the media a say no comment to them.  about dinner on saturday,  we already have plans to see a musical but we are free tonight.  would you like to move dinner up to tonight?  let me know.  -eric 
 You are invited to join in the excitement of Texas in the Big XII Championship game this Saturday at 7 PM at my apartment.  We will provide the food.  Let me know if you guys are interested.  My apartment is at 4848 Pin Oak Pk.  #1503  Houston 77081.  goto mapquest.com for directions.  -Eric

 I got the cashiers check for the full amount and deposited it at Fidelity.  I am just waiting for it to post to my account now.  -E 
 A friend and I were debating about payroll in a bankruptcy type situation.  I said that there were no guarantees with regards to payroll until the courts approve it.  He said that payroll was an administrative expense and therefore should be guaranteed?  What do you think?  -E 
 you are an asshole ! 
 and where did you see that? 
 i doubt they will show 
 sure.  have you decided on what you would like us to bring? 
 that is nice to hear.  i will look forward to speaking with her. 
 what do you think? 
 I like issey miyake and acqua di gio.  -e 
 Hey,  How are things going with you guys?  We really enjoyed Saturday night out at the house.  We should get together more often.  How is Mr. Hamilton doing ? I was thinking of sending some flowers to either the hospital (if he is out of ICU) or the house.  Can you give me the address of either?  Love, E 
 Harry,  Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  Things are so bad at work right now. I have nothing to do whasoever.  I get in to work around 9 am and leave around 12:30 every day.  I hope all is going well in the job search.  I saw your add/drop request for the Pats. If you want me to add the Steelers as well just let me know.  Also, you might want to practice, "Would you like to SuperSize that?"  -Eric

 we need a fourth again 
 I am ok with tomorrow.  Sorry I haven't been able to set lunch up. These crossword puzzles have really kept me busy.  -Eric 
 I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  Sorry guys 
 Hi Amy,  My numbers are home: 713-661-2601 and cell: 713-628-3104.  Call me if you have questions about the offer letter.   -Eric Bass 
 Any news?  Which night do you want to get together?  -e 
 sounds good - i will make the reservations for sat.  is 7 o'clock ok? 
 the card was though  :0) 
 7 o'clock it is - see you then.  -e 
 redwood grill! 
 that is good to hear.  i was driving through west u last night and saw quite a few.  i hit a couple of kids so i figure that netted me a few points.  i look forward to seeing you on saturday  love, e 
 Anybody up for happy hour after work?  I was thinking Kenneally's at around 5.  Let me know 
 thought you might be interested 
 For some reason your e-mail to Shanna and I was quarantined by enron b/c of virus issues.  What did you send?  It looked like links to Fairfield and Waco weather.  Let me know.  -Eric 
 no problem - thanks for joining us.  we enjoy spending time with you guys.  love, e 
 tkts are hard to come by but its looking like we can get in to the game - sect 144 row 25 
 I am taking friday off - Do you want to together for some golf? 
 that's fine ditch me for another tourney.  but i undsertand you have to find alternative forms of income with enron's recent performance. the greatest football team in college history plays kansas on saturday -e 
 I got your card.  Thanks for joining us on Saturday night.  Shanna and I always enjoy your company.  Love, E 
 no special occassion really, just burning vacation.  i have 12 days left.  whats going on in your world? 
 that sounds good -  i am taking that friday off. the mood is pretty somber around here today.  love, e 
 i agree with your comments about managament.  it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights.  i have bought some more shares today.  my view is that the company will not fold.  the worst case scenario is a buyout. so, it seems like we should bottom out shortly.  right?  good news on uncle george 
 what is your logon and password for the-university - i am having some problems with mine  thanks,  eric 
 Is this the old enron building or the new one?  Eric Bass 
 i'm fine nothing new to report other than the stuff in the news.  i think everything will work out  L, e 
 Anybody up for happy hour at Ruggles Enron Field after work? 
 i thought it was ruggles DY-ENRON Field 
 so now that we have had this witty banter back and forth - is anyone coming to happy hour? 
 what is jason's phone # at work and at home? 
 we are going to happy hour at Ruggles Enron - dynegy  Field after work. any interest? 
 we'll be there all night 
 you are welcome to invite chance and anyone else down there 
 change of plans.  we are going to front porch.  so meet up if you can/want 
 everyone else paid up front 
 what do you think? 
 you don't care 
 Brian.   Things are pretty hectic right now.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.  Dynegy acquired Enron (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.  Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.  I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.  Of course, now that Enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.  Good luck on finals and keep in touch.  Your Pal,  Eric 
 i like it - how much? 
 he should have been 
 you are weird 
 what's up?  things are pretty hectic here.  you lucked out by getting out of dodge.   are you still coming to see the 2001-2002 nat'l champs on T+1?  -eric 
 i think things will be ok at enron.  it is pretty depressing right now though.  how is school for you?  just to let you know - i got seats on the 40 yd line for the game.  right now it is going to be  me, you, matt lenhart, and my dad.  i will be out of the office next tuesday and wednesday.  so give me call at work before then or you can call me on my cell (713)-628-3104 or at home (713)661-2601.  let me know  -e 
 that sounds good.  i will see you then -eric 
 It will just be the two of us on Sunday.  Thought you might like to know.  L, E

 interesting . .  thanks for the update 
 If wanted to play golf at sugar creek next wed, can I get on without you and how much does it cost?  -e 
 we would love for you to join us.  -eric 
 I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.  So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.  Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.   -Eric 
 i will just come out tomorrow and we will celebrate.  we will get together some other time with shanna 
 they won't be playing but they will be tied up to a post for our enjoyment 
 hey dave - we are on for noon tomorrow.  i will try to make it out to your house tomorrow. i have to go pick up the clubs at the parents house.  so give me directions.  by the way, my dad offered to buy us all lunch at sugar creek so, lets try to meet up a little early.  -eric 
 That sounds great.  I will be able to make it.  Thanks,  Eric 
 but you will only go if charlie goes? 
 you are one sick fuck 
 You owe $80 for fantasy football.  When can you pay? 
 FYI- since you didn't take care of business 
 surprising . . . 
 How about we all go to dinner at Mark's on Sunday night?  How does that sound?  -Eric 
 as we talked about yesterday, i am still at enron.  while i have a job, i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments.  i am living off of newcastle and 59 in the Gables Pin Oak.  it is very nice - especially since i don't have a roommate any more. glad to hear that the family is doing well what are you doing at your new job?  accounting? what about the firls - what are they doing? 
 are you telling me that you want me to buy and you will pay me back? 
 so bob hebert's finance committee more important? 
 thats fine just let me know what i owe 
 Who should I contact with questions about my 2001 W-2?  I think that mine is misstated.   Thanks,  Eric Bass x3-0977 
 why can't dad make it? 
 Hi Aunt Bonnie,  It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.  On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?  It was nice to hear from you.  Love,  Eric 
 OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.  We will meet at 5 pm SHARP at Cinemark Theaters on Richmond and Sam Houston Parkway (Beltway 8).  This is the movie theater across the street from Jason's apartment.  You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.  Let me know if you have questions.  -Eric 
 can you send the e-mail about the mexican resorts to dominator128@hotmail.com <mailto:dominator128@hotmail.com>?  Thanks,  E 
 Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.  We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?  Let me know.  -Eric 
 There will be 8 total.  It should be fun.  See ya then 
 8 - one person is not on the e-mail 
 I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.  Let me know if you have any questions.  -Eric

 well i know that charlie was promoted and he hasn't done jack 
 I think you gave me a bad e-mail address for tom so can you find out if he is coming or not? 
 Are you coming? You are the last one to RSVP.  I need to know so I can make= the reservation.  -Eric 
 Are you coming? You are the last one to RSVP.  I need to know so I can make the reservation.  -Eric 
 Hey Brian,  The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: Bryan Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  Matt Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; Tim Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; Chad got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to India to teach English to young Indians (how crazy is she?); and Shanna still has a job at Enron in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.  I think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to Lenny and know his situation.  How is Hector holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.  BTW, Jason (my bro) get married in February.  Keep in touch- Eric 
 We are still wating on Bankruptcy court to decide our future.  The Dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago.  My division (trading ops) will most likely be sold to either UBS or Citigroup.  Keep in touch.  Eric 
 did he tell you if he was coming or not? 
 I haven't heard back form Tom yet, but everyone else is going. Can you get in touch with him? 
 Hey Dad,  Did you get the link I sent on the Def Ann?  If so, what do you think?  Is there anything I missed?  I am still waiting on a couple of RSVPs for the bachelor party so I will let you know on the transport.  How are things otherwise? -E 
 Mom said you needed it:  2210 W. Dallas St., #212 Houston, Texas, 77019 
 Alright last e-mail:  We got clarification on the rooms.  The Pkg deal stays the same but if you want to get just the room with 2 breakfasts each day it is $79/night - if you want the Premium Room ( the only difference is that the Premium room has jets in the tub) then it is $103/night with no breakfast $115/night with breakfast. 
 no i am just hearing that most everyone got promoted 
 I forgot to mention that if you do not buy the pkg then lift tickets are about $55/person per day. I think we will probably just book the room and worry about the lift tickets ourselves. 
 Here is the info:  Mar 10-14  Caesars Tahoe Pkg rate is $300 for the first two nights and $172 for each additional night so - $644 total for 4 nights. The Pkg includes two lift tickets per day (3 total per person), voucher for the use of the spa daily, 2 daily brucnh buffets This is for the Regular Room  Regular rate for regular room is $79/night  Regular Rate for Jacuzzi Room is $89/night Sun through Tues and $145 for Wed  the regular rates do not include anything but the room   Airfare Continental offer nonstop for $370/person - flight time is 3.5 hours Other airlines offer 1 stop service for $275/person - flight time is 7 hours    Let me know when you decide  -Eric 
 I have not heard back from tommybomb or scott re: your bachelor party.  Maybe you would like to try them to see if they are going. I need to book the cruise ASAP though.  So let me know.  -E 
 Do you want to go to dinner on Friday with us and some friends.  Lil' Papasitos on Kirby. 
 Hey Mom,  Things are going well.  I heard you guys had a good time at the shower. I don't know Michael's address but I will get it.  When are we going to get together?  -Eric 
 We are going to Lil' Papasito's with some friends on Friday.  Just wanted to know if you wanted to join us.  -eric 
  I still haven't heard from you guys regarding the Bachelor Party. Let me know 
 Hey Brian,  Long time no hear.  How are things at Harvard?  I trust you had a good holiday period.  Are you still in Kentucky or back in Boston? How was the first round of finals?  Things are good down here.  I stayed in Houston for the holidays.  I still have a job.  The big date for us (in the trading group) is this Friday. That is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group.  Hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that.  I really have done now work for the past 2 months.  Mostly just sitting around and researching mutual funds and doing crossword puzzles.  I have been coming in to work around 9 and leaving at about 2 everyday.  What oral surgeon did you go to to get your wisdom teeth out? Tim needs to get his out and was wondering if you recommended the surgeon that did yours?  Drop me a line when you get a chance.  -Eric 
 actually- i forgot to take the $40 out- so $184.50 
 Hey Harry,  How are things?  Have you found a job yet?  I trust the holidays went well for you.  Anyways,  I have a check for $74 for FFL - where can I send it?  -Eric 
 just wondering - mainly i was wondering if matt smith is a manager now? 
 your net payout is $224.50  how do you want me to get the check to you? 
 you owe $80 for the league.  $120 for dues minus $40 for winning the league pool one week. do you agree? 
 hey brian, the holidays were good.  it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work.  how were your's? and how is the job search going? i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league.  i think that you get 25% of the pot for 2nd place. the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.  how do you think they will be next year?   oh well, i hope things are going well.  lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon.  -eric 
 i haven't really thought of that yet.  i guess i will wait on the response that i get.  L, e 
   The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party.  The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.  The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.  Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.  -Eric 
 you need to forward the invite to your buddy that you didn't provide me with e-mail

 new orleans was fun.  the wedding was nice and it was good to get away for the weekend.  how was your weekend? as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.  i think in the short term we will definately see the teens. -e 
 sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.  as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.  i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.  i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.  i might just sell now and look to buy back lower.  let me know what you think  -e

 Brett,  Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare time on your hands. Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times (lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking. Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  Where are you currently stationed?  Drop me a line next time you come to houston?  -out 
 Hey Gillette,  The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.

 shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow, so she will not be alone. tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year when i first started.  he had been dating his fiancee during college but they had broken up about a year ago.  he had been trying to get back together but i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.  i guess he had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went well over christmas he went ahead.  have a fun and safe weekend.

 Now I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A designated IR player cannot play.

 too complicated    Enron Capital Management 
 So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 4:30 - 5).  Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else. 
 i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is actually better than them.  see below 
 i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.  get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same next year.  lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.  but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team. 
 ... or we could go to keneally's and really be fat asses (golden tee) 
 Oh yeah, and by the way here are the rankings . . .  http://louisianastate.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=40&p=58&sp=1 
 Wilkerson is the number 3 prospect in the country at lineman behind Johnathon Scott a commitment of guess who - Texas.  http://louisianastate.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=40&p=3&sp=1&pl=-13604 Wilkerson http://longhornlink.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=798&p=3&sp=1&pl=-12695 Scott 
 unfortunately i don't think tha louise would appreciate that too much considering she is in town and will be attending. so how about kenneally's or sherlock's 
 in    Enron North America Corp.

 great game . . . terrible result.  i can't really be dissappointed the play of simms or the WRs (dropped passes). the defense was very dissappointing

 customer service on the website 
 I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help.  -E  To whom it may concern:  I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time. It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight. I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.  For your research I provide the following data: Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna Husser, and Donnita Franklin.  Final Itinerary (after all changes) - Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM  Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM  Sincerely,  Eric Bass

 To whom it may concern:  In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.  My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament?   Thanks in advance,   Eric Bass x3-0977

 Gary,  We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target.

 Are we really going to stay at the shithole hotel in Vegas or are you going to get rooms at the Bellagio? 
 Dan,  I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language? Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones.  I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.   Thanks in advance.  Sincerely,  Eric Bass x3-0977

 Can you lower my bid to $26 for A. Denson? 
 We need a couple of extra players tonight.  Luis - do you have a friend that can play?  Brian - can you ask Lenny to play? 
 Are you up for a little Golden Tee on Friday?

 $52 bid for D. Autry 
 what is your home phone #? 
 the most pitiful excuse for a football game that I have ever seen.  Greg Davis needs to be fired and the young players need to play, i.e. Roy Williams and BJ need to play more than just on third downs.

 What, you tear down the goal posts because you beat the #11 team in the country? 
 I have not verified your math but "championships" prior to the associated press do not count b/c there was no governing authority that conferred national titles before the AP ( as you will notice the retroactive declaration of national champions prior to the early 1930's). 
 We can postpone until the ticker sytem is available.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Eric

 Hey Allison,  Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?  How are things in your world? You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you again?  Eric

 $0 for centers 
 What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.  -E 
 congrats on the new position - I just heard    Enron North America Corp. 
 do you want to go beat the crap out of some OU fans in Dallas this weekend?

 I need to place a $0 bid for Steve Christie and a $0 bid for Wade Richey.  Thanks 
 Jason seemed excited about the concert.  I think  this is one of his favorite bands.  I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest sibling.

 Hi Mom - I got your e-mail yesterday.  Shanna wasn't offended by your poignant political comments, she just knows, in no uncerain terms, that your are Republican and are going to vote for Bush.  Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.  I will pay the late fee the next time I rent a movie.  How are things otherwise?  -E 
 yes, it will be there all season 
 I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate this), Applewhite should play.  I think if Applewhite plays and we have a decent running game, we can blow them out.  Our defense is good enough to shut pretty much anyone down.  When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there? 
 yep 
 our football game is at 7 - sorry 
 Our game is at 7:00 this week.  We play the other Enron team.  Please let me know whether or not you will attend. 
 that was pretty stupid    Enron North America Corp. 
 can't do it - for one I don't have curtis martin and for two fred taylor has no value right now - propose something for someone I have 
 I forgot, I offered you Toomer and Garner for Terrell and Jackson - if you still want to do that then that is fine - if not look at the deal below. 
 My deal on the other side fell through - so what do you think about Garner, Toomer, and Schroeder for Terrell and Rice 
 Is this some scam foundation that you have set up so that you can retire early... I know how these things work, I've been around the block.  Seriously though, I will be happy to contribute.  -Eric

 remember these temps are at lower elevations so we can expect colder 
 yeah, try to be there on time - preferably 6:30 - b/c we only have eight people

 yep

 Are you going to make tomorrow? 
 our game is at 7:00 tomorrow - can you make it? 
 your choice of anderson or watters   and  taylor 
 touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good all year. My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.  Let me know 
 alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring back in the league) will still be there. 
 George has no value after last weeks games - I will give you garner and toomer for taylor 
 . . . in the US in the last five years and we will be in the mountains to enjoy it.  Should be fun!!!   :-)    http://www.weather.com/weather/cities/us_co_telluride.html 
 Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez? 
 Matt has a win and Harry a loss.  They tied but the win goes to the one with the most reserve points. 
 yeah, just come by my desk.  i have it for you. 
 Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.  Do you want to go?  -Eric 
 Alright, you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him? 
 here, woman! 
 Let me know whether or not you can make it to the game on Wednesday @7.

 walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.  now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters, anderson or george?  I need to know fairly quickly 
 alright then anderson rather than watters 
 what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters? 
 Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack? 
 Have you bought any new DVD's recently?  If so, which ones?

  Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback Sept. 19, 2000 By Len Pasquarelli SportsLine.com Senior Writer     Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed.  "If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."   Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP)  In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games.  A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change.  One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis.  The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 yards per catch this season.  But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter.  "There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else." 
 i think i can scrounge one up    Enron North America Corp. 
 yeah, just talk to chris gaskill    Enron Capital Management 
 By the way, wear your grey "HEAT" jerseys to the game and bring a blue t-shirt as an extra. 
 we have at least 8 
 I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop. Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of pride. 
 We have a game tonight at 7:00.  Please try to make it to the field by 6:30.   -Eric

 Gary,  What is the market for IAH Jan-Mar HDD swaps (we are looking to BUY)?  How does this compare to the 30 yr avg?  Thanks for your help.   Eric x3-0977 
 Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to see how you fare against a top 5 team.  Maybe we will see you next year.  Of course, you will have to make it to the Rose Bowl.  Good luck in Dallas!  Hook 'Em Texas Longhorns - 2001 National Champs

 Remember - all pickup requests must now be sent through Pat Ryder at pryder@enron.com. 
 alright, no williams  can i interest you in a receiver and say lamar smith for robert smith or ron dayne 
 so basically what you are saying is that had you had the 3rd pick in the draft you would have taken r williams    Enron Capital Management 
 just out of curiousity, would you do stephen davis for ricky williams straight up?    Enron Capital Management 
 did she try your patience?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Stephen Davis, Terry Glenn and Bill Schroeder for Williams, Moss, and Travis Taylor? 
 are you irritated?    Enron North America Corp. 
 beside - stephen davis is better than terrell 
 Have you heard anything about the reschedule date? 
 i dont have dillon any more 
 that is all i wanted to hear 
 you don't even have a 3rd receiver, johnson is out with a bum hamstring 
 your receivers are terrible - i am trying to help you out! 
 Garner and Glenn for T.D. ? 
 Would you take Terry Glenn and Charlie Garner for Fred Taylor? 
 Terry Glenn and Charlie Garner for Eddie George? 
 Charlie Garner, Terry Glenn, and Donovan Mcnabb for Marshall Faulk 
 that is pretty gay 
 that is fine with me, but what about shanna, she might be a little uncomfortable with just the 3 of us 
 no poblem - i enjoyed it as well.  let's do it again sometime    Enron Capital Management 
 Remember:  The free add/drop period will end on Wednesday Aug30 at noon.  After that point, we will submit add/drop bids to Pat at pryder@enron.com.

 i'm interested in WRs not QBs  come back with robinson in there 
 thats really bad! 
 what are you trying to show me?  this just sends me to the ap website 
 Mother,  I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.  Both you and Dad replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious and there was no timeframe on its completion.  You know that I love you and Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your implication with your last comment).  If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to remember that my brother and I are different people.  You cannot neccessarily associate his actions with mine.  Please take that into consideration.  I love you very much,  Eric 
 you tell me that you are cheating on me . . . .  interesting    Enron North America Corp. 
 I sent that file to you in error. Please disregard.   Thanks,  Eric 
 check this out on my offer of schroeder and harris for engram 
 some people are idiots 
 i am still willing to do that side bet if you want 
 ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package?  how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade that i think is fair for my team  let me know what you think 
 didnt i just make you an offer for connell?  you are not going to get both dillon and davis  so if you have to have both of them tell me so i can back out now  but the trade i offered you is fair 
 alright i would do davis,schroeder, and harris, for faulk and connell 
 jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent , they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got suspended.  if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.  so let me know 
 faulk and mccaffrey for lamar smith, davis and chrebet or schroeder  you desperately need depth at rb - lamar smith is solid 
 i took the vote down, we will only vote on trades later in the year 
 i could do wayne chrebet, stephen davis, and raymont harris for faulk and mccaffrey 
 we had said we were going to vote on trades. we have had our first trade. some people have come to me requesting a vote   please go to the website and vote on the trade between the the Lie Downs and the Rounders 
 Raymont Harris, bill schroeder and wayne chrebet for smith 
 Rob,  I need to get a new gas daily product created.  This product will be settled daily against the Katy Plant Tailgate under the East-Houston-Katy subheading in Gas Daily.   Call with questions.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 counter then 
 corey dillon, raymont harris, and bill schroeder for faulk,  let me know what you think or if you have a counter 
 some people are dumb asses 
 i will give you schroeder and raymont harris.  that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb.  by the way engram was drafted in the eight round, so was harris, and schroeder was drafted in the 10th  that is an 8 and a 10 for 8 
 check this out  another example of how ridiculous people are 
 engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i might add) for a backup WR.  the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have a pretty good year.  by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.  so don't give me any of that 
 your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th best rb for the 30th receiver? 
 oh, because i was going to offer up stephen davis, but never mind ... 
 What do you want for Fred Taylor? 
 for Kevin Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, and Bill Schroeder? 
 http://www.rsn.com/cams/telluride/ 
 What Do you want for Engram? 
 Hey Mom,   The x-rays were negative, and i haven't heard about the review yet.  how is everything on your front?  love,  e 
 Hear anything on Engram? 
 What is your offer on marcus robinson? 
 Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne Chrebet?   Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play week 1 and maybe 2).  Let me know 
 What do you want for Fred Taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 weeks? 
 Please take time to answer a new poll on the website! 
 Alright,  I think this is a good deal for you! You get Depth at Receiver and Depth at Running Back.  Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith  FOR  Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith  What do you think?    Enron Capital Management 
 any counter?    Enron Capital Management 
 What do you think?  chrebet,dillon 
 $0 bid for the Redskins D 
 How about Raymont, Bill Schroeder and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman? 
 we will make it effective today so that, you can't stockpile players 
 Your running backs suck.  I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman. 
 I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for free agents until the start of the season.  If you disagree, let me know.  The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have no more than 17 players on your roster at any time. 
 since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better record than you this year 
 i thought we decided that was during the season - up until the season starts it is free. 
 your team is so bad 
 so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo 
 What do you want for Randy Moss? 
 i repeat, uou have no offer? 
 so, there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for, i find that hard to believe 
 i will give you walls and terrence wilkins 
 What do you want for tony gonzalez?

 i am going to get x-rays on friday or saturday, so you can stop worrying. things are sucking right now on the market, so i can't say that i am enjoying my job, but i am looking forward to the fantasy football draft on sunday. shann started her new job today. she is a little stressed about the increase in workload.  she is going to visit the family this weekend, so i have a weekend on my own.  maybe i can come out this weekend to visit ( if you can fit me in).  i had a great time last saturday.  how are things in your world?  L, -e

 what do you want for your 4th round pick 
 the other side backed out 
 i have to swing the other side of it , i'll let you know 
 its called bargaining,  how is me giving up a 2 and a 3 good for me?  Its not, I am trying to figure out what you are willing to take 
 plove, you might  as well cut your losses.  you are not going to get over on someone as badly as matt got over on you.  so you might as well bite the bullet and make a trade that actually is good for your team 
 how about the final pick in the 2nd and my third for your 2nd and your 4th 
 i'm not a big prince fan - she might want to though 
 my 2 and 11 
 what do you want for it? 
 How do I go about getting my logon id and password?  I seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out.   Thanks,   Eric Bass x30977 
 How do I go about getting my logon id and password?  I seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out.   Thanks,   Eric Bass x30977 
 can't do it , but i am willing to do my 4 and 7 for your 2 
 alright, how about my 4 and 7 for your 2 
 no ican't do that.  how about my 4 and 7 for your 2 
 I will be at the dinner on Thursday.  Thanks,  Eric 
 in order to counter offer, you must have had an offer.  if you remember, you offered me a lesser trade than that already   my counter offer is 4,7,10 for your 2, 8 
 By popular vote, we will not redraw.  Our draft will take place, this Sunday at 11:45 am at BW-3 in Rice Village. 
 This is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to downtown and near greenville - another bar area).  Might be a little more expensive but probably worth it.  http://www.hilton.com/doubletree/hotels/DFWCNDT/index.html?show=all 
 he probably doesn't want to redraw because he knows he can't possibly rip you off any more than he already has! 
 did you buy enron this morning? 
 I am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order.  Some, have said that it is not fair for Steve to be handed the 6th slot.  Let me know what you think.   -Eric 
 thanks, again, for calling me back last night! 
 Brian, Hector, and Lenny have dropped out (what a shocker).  Steve Venturatos has graciously offered to take their place.  Thanks Steve. 
 here is our website    http://football69.commissioner.com/mp/join?league=kourn&owner=&random=3598&  the rules are on the site at the bottom of the page  we will start  1 QB 2 RB 3 WR 1 TE 1 K 1 Def/st   our draft is next sunday at noon at BW-3 in rice 
 i was going to watch the saints game with some friends at 7. 
 actually, i was thinking about an early dinner, like 4-4:30?  let me know 
 17 players on the roster 
 what about smu area? 
 Starting Lineups for the league will include  1 QB 2 RB 3 WR 1 TE 1 K 1 Def  for hector, lenny and brian  1 Quarterback (he throws the ball) 2 Running Backs (they run the ball) 3 Wide Receivers (they catch ball) 1 Tight End (they catch and block) 1 Kicker 1 Defensive team 
 dinner is fine too.  is jason going to make it? 
 i think we should be able to make it out on saturday for lunch.  maybe around 11-12? i don't have any news on toni, she is still on a respirator but is responsive.  i'll keep you posted.  e 
 what's up with the biz? is he an associate? 
 you know that both o'neal and matt are out? 
 i have not gotten a good response so i think shanna and i are going to stay in town.  the weather is going to be fine, hector was just blowing smoke. 
 by the way, buy it now b/c it is going to 100 by year end. 
 i am doing great.  i am going to get my neck checked out again today ( i can't beilieve you gave me those faulty genes).  i am sure you know that toni woke up yesterday, she is cognizant and responsive but still can't speak or move.  i will keep you updated.  how are you?  love,  e 
 As Enron reaches new highs (82), I hope you took my advice to buy it at 74. Did you?  -E 
 http://www.hyatt.com/usa/dallas/hotels/hotel_dfwrd.html  my bro says this place is nice but don't know how expensive 
 Matt told me he is going to draft an lsu player with the first pick - Eddie Kennison 
 alright, no more memos about bw3 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative. matt, you won't be there, so your input is worthless bryan, two rows isn't conducive to big groups, so pick some place else. 
 by popular vote, the draft will take place at noon on 8/20 at BW-3 in rice village. 
 We are going to have the draft on 8/20.  However, we still need to decide where and at what time.  I would prefer to have the draft around noon.  We can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the internet).  Please let me know ASAP.  -Eric 
 it doesn't look good for austin, how is your aunt?

 Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board off of a nearby fence, wedges it down the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving his friend's life.  A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL" he starts writing in his notebook.  "But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies. "Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed you were."  The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."  The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."  "Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."  The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."  The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."  "Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you root for?" the reporter asked.  "Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.  The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."

"I don't want to be rude," he said last week. "I just wish they'd stop=20 asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ..."  Got the picture.  OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu= le.  Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba= ck=20 Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20 Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we= ek  This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu= t=20 from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen= =20 Hardin.  Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.  Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range= =20 when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.= =20 During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20 sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few= =20 football games are played under water.

"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20 because he wanted to be challenged," Hardin said. "It was a challenge to co= me=20 up with things to challenge him."  "The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm= =20 up," Applewhite said. "I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo= r=20 six minutes instead of five."  After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based= =20 more on conventional wisdom than necessity.  "I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it," he said.

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of= =20 which being a renewed appreciation for the game.  "So what if I'm tired?" he said. "I can rest when I die."

"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that= =20 it felt like my arm was run ragged," he said.  Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20 takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,= =20 will take a little longer.  Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?  "I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris," Hardin said of his=20 occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational= =20 ploy. "But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever."  "It's remarkable the way he's come back," said sophomore cornerback Roderic= k=20 Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the= =20 speediest receivers in workouts. "In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight."  Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,= =20 Babers said, "I think (Simms) has the advantage.

 you realize that who plove takes is irrelevant b/c your are going to take the best player available at either slot.  It is what you think you can make up with the additional picks.  besides, both of us are at equal risk to who plove picks 
 My 1,4,and 6 for your 1, 5,7 
 My 1,4,and 6 for your 1, 5,7 
 So, what you got? 
 You cannot pickup players in the playoffs.  That defeats the whole purpose of the playoff system!

 Am I going to be able to get these out on the website today?  Eric 
 I offered you my 1 and 3 for your 1 and 4.  I can throw in my 5 for your 6.  Let me know.  Eric 
 I would like to trade for your 2nd pick in the draft.  I can offer you a 2nd round pick and a 9th round pick.  What do you think?  Eric 
 I will give you my 3rd and 9th round picks for your 2nd.  Let me know. 
 You're right. We cheated by trying to screw everyone who isn't fortunate enough to work at Enron.  Give it a rest.  The order was determined by an impartial 3rd party. 
 1st, and 10th 
 Here it is.  1. Dave Baumbach 2. Matt Lenhart 3. Bryan Hull 4. Mick Walters 5. O'neal Winfree 6. Hector/Lenny/Brian 7. Eric Bass 8. Harry Bucalo 9. Jason Bass 10. Phillip Love 11. Ramiro 12. Gary Lamphier 
 it will probably be today sometime 
 By unanimous vote we will pre-determine the draft order.  So, if nobidy has any objections, I will pick the draft order here at work under the scrutinhy of several other players ( Dave B, O. Winfree, M. Lenhart, M. Walters).  Also, by majority vote, will have a required tight end posn.  Meaning the starting lineups will include 1QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def.   Please e-mail back if you are ok with me picking the draft order.  Eric 
 Here is the analysis that I completed.  Let me know if you have questions.  Eric     Enron North America Corp. 
 Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off. Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we will be playing for the National Championship next year.  How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?  Later-  Eric 
 Just in case you were interested.  Here is some of the correspondence that is going on. 
 Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?  Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior to the draft.  I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan and trade your picks.  Let me know.  Eric

Waters ****************************************************************  You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door.  Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers. At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way.  With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.  In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a weapon--it looks like a crowbar.  When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor. One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside.  As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless. Yours was never registered.  Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died. They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm.  When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter. "What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask. "Only ten-to-twelve years," he replies, as if that's nothing. "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."  The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous times. But the next day's headline says it all: "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die." The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type pranksters.  As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media picks it up, then the international media.  The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.  The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you've been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.  A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man.  It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.  The judge sentences you to life in prison.  __________________________________________  This case really happened.  *********************************** On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England, killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term.  How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the once-great British Empire?  It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns. Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.  Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead.  The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle.)  Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school.  For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns. The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens.  During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We cannot have people take the law into their own hands."  All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars.  When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities. Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn't comply.  Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns from private citizens.  How did the authorities know who had handguns?  The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.  Sound familiar?  WAKE UP AMERICA, THIS IS WHY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION.    - att1.htm

 By popular vote, we will have a draft instead of an auction and the draft will take place on 8/20.  Rules to follow.  Eric 
 We have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for acquiring players.  Please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links to the auction ( I think it is Auctions A-Z) and let me know which option you think is better. 
 i told you so! 
 The new draft date is 8/20 by overwhelming majority.  Stay tuned for further details. 
 Hector,  I invitate you touch my big, beautiful, American breasts! 
 Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.  I am excited because I haven't experienced real winter like conditions for 3 years. Have you been skiing before?  -Eric 
 There are some conflicts with the draft date, so we will probably need to have it on a different date.  Please tell me if you prefer 9/2 ( the day before the season starts) or 8/20.  We could also do it during the week, but it will probably takle 3 or 4 hrs.  Let me know suggestions. 
 what day is good for you? 
 don't worry about it 
 im thinking perfect storm 
 It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.  Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, too early, too late. If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year. You all do not stand a chance!  -Eric 
 i think this is a call for help.  maybe you should provide with some service tonight? 
 by the way we are going to see either the patriot or the perfect storm tonight - so decide! 
 hey, long time no hear! how have you been? how was the trip?  i had fantastic time on my cruise. unfortunately, i got back on sunday and it was straight to work on monday.  i'm assuming you didn't take up permanent residence in Belize, so, if you didn't, drop me a line.   -e

 Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.  I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this PRC?  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Eric Bass x3-0977

 I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation. The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important. The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., natural gas, coal, etc.)  Do you have this information?  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977

 You're done,  Hale is starting on Sat.  LSU doesn't stand a chance! http://www.ncaabaseball.com/news/bbo/bbc/2000/06/08/960520710439.html 
 you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about the EES bullshit.  if it bothers you that much then say something about it. as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.  i know that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.  i was just trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's lead.  and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought up the cfa.  i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.  so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat. 
 You had to hit below the belt.  We were having a friendly shit talking contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.  What's up with that? 
 I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.  I would hate to have to come to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.  I guess I just had this opportunity fall in my lap because I never have added the kind of value that you did while in risk or EES.  I guess that is why I got offered a promotion to stay and you were sent packing to Enron Siberia.  P.S. Shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend, maybe you can hook up! 
 It may not be rocket science, but not everyone can hack it.  Isn't that why you left the wholesale side of the business?  Besides somebody has to take up the slack for EES.  Let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your loss for the quarter, I'm sure I can spare some out of my book! 
 I don't need to talk shit about the game.  I will let the Longhorns do the talking for me on Saturday.  By the way,  you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now. 
 let me know if you want me to bring something.  love e

By Andy Katz ESPN.com  With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.  NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several projections we'll have on ESPN.com.  A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing in Chicago.  The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.  Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what happens.  ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.     Chris Mihm  Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.  1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.  2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.  3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward (which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door open for a return.  4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.  5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.  6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard.  7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.  8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.  9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.  10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season.  11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much different.  12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in Chicago -- if he shows.  13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness.  14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.  15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the Pacers.  16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind Cleaves.  17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.  18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.  19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.  20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first round, regardless of where he's being picked.  21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural pick for the Raptors.  22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.  23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first round.  24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the Bulls some versatility on the floor.  25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.  26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.  27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers have a history of going younger in the draft.  28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many miles left in his legs.  29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.  Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN.com.  ?

 We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek. This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.  Let me know if you have further questions.  Eric

 by the way, i think luis is out of town.  so, if you want, you are the qb.  let me know

 Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month ( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)  In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you check into this and get back to him?  Thanks,  Eric     Enron Capital Management

 Sorry I didn't call you last night.  I didn't get home until 10 and brian was on the phone untill 11, so I figured you were asleep by then.  I'll give you a call later.  e

 Dale/Melba,  I need a gas daily monthly index to be set up for both Carthage Hub and Agua Dulce Hub. We will be trading basis swaps off of this differential.  Call with questions. Thanks, Eric x3-0977 
 I really just need historical throughput, especially third party, to the major market areas.  I am going to analyze this data from a temperature correlation perspective to see if we can use weather derivatives to hedge throughput exposure. Data as far back as can be pulled accurately would be helpful.  Call with questions.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977    Enron North America Corp. 
 Earl,  James McKay referred me to you for information regarding historical throughput numbers on HPL.  Ed Gottlob and I are looking at ways to hedge the pipe and need this data as far back as can accurately be obtained.  Thanks,   Eric

 We will trade this product every day, but we aim to start trading it this bid week, if possible.  Eric   Dale Neuner   05/04/2000 01:41 PM 
 Any news? we would like to trade that this bid week   Thanks,  Eric 
 he forgot  the address  sorry :(  try bankrate.com 
 Here are the numbers   Enron North America Corp. 
 We need these locations set up to trade financial products for now.  We will be trading physical at Carthage but firmness is not a problem there.  Agua Dulce firmness may be a problem for physical, but as of now we are only going to trade it financially.     Dale Neuner   05/01/2000 09:43 AM 
 Dale,  On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC.   In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.  Thanks for your help. 
 We had fun.  Shanna got sick, though, so we left around 1.  You? 
 I'll probably go to the tour and, if weather permits, the game.      Enron Capital Management

 If the weather holds out ...  Let me know whether or not you will be there. Please try to make it by 7:15. 
 No thanks.  I have a bunch from work already.  Are you going to any of it?  E 
 i am going tomorrow 
 No problem.  I didn't go out last night - just had a quiet evening.  I am having a great day - work wise.  Are you going to the shell open? 
 This looks good.  All we need is to get it into production.   Thanks,  Eric   Dale Neuner   04/27/2000 04:05 PM

 Hey Paul,  I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game (2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.  Thanks,  Eric x3-0977 
 i bet you score over 200! 
 Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals. 
 Tom Martin 
 be there on time beaaaaaccccccccchhhhhh    Enron Investment Partners 
 We have a game tonight at 6:45.  Please try to be there by 6:30.  Let me know whether or not you will be at the game.  Eric 
 Thought you might be interested in this! 
 we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are more open. you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.  what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow?
