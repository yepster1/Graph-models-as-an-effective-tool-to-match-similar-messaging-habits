   Here it is: 507086. 
 Attached is the final version of of Transwestern's response to the CPUC's protest in Docket No. RP97-288-017. The attachment was filed with FERC last Wednesday. 
 Thanks, Glen. I'll plan to attend. 
 Iris,  Thanks for the message. If it's not too much trouble, I would very much appreciate a printed report showing how much time I have left. Thanks. 
 Merci! 
 Deborah,  The latest commodity agreement amendments were not yet filed in the binder. (They were signed right before I left.) However, I gave those to Raquel as well, so you should have them. As I mentioned this morning, Maureen Palmer also has copies. 
   Maxine,  I'll be in the office all of next week.   Bill 
  Yes, I already have a call into her. 
   Drew and Greg,  Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  I wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. I would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks. 
 I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule.  An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.  Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".

Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks. 
 Any objections to Mary Kay's suggestion? If not, I'll probably need the help of one of you in contacting Jeff McMahon. 
 Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks. 
 Joel,  Yes, I would start with Michael. He did a calculation a year or so ago when OWC first filed for bankruptcy and should be able to update that. Another source is Maureen Palmer, who (if you haven't met her yet) is the EES business person who is responsible for the OWC/EES relationship. You should probably speak with Maureen in any event to get her input on whether EES really wants to pursue this claim. When I spoke with her about this several months ago, there was apparently a difference of opinion among our business people on this. Good luck. Let me know if I can help on anything else. 
 I have no idea. I have never heard of these swaps. I don't know when these were implemented. Presumably after we signed the original deal, although I don't know. Apparently, the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input. Scary. You may want to check with Jim Keller's/Mike Smith's group to see if anyone there knows anything about this. 
 This is a test. 
 Drew,  Steve Harris and the other Transwestern commercial people are seeking guidance on what limits will be imposed by the new
