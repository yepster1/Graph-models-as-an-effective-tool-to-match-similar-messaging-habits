  When I saw this, I new that the dark Republican years would be over by 2004. Is their anyone more qualified in the areas of foreign policy, energy policy, political economics, or complex social issues than the Rev? We'll finally have the pimpin' leader that we need. 
 How about Skewers? 
 fascinating. I'd like to work at getting a piece 
 Dipak, Seattle/Tacoma is the summation of a large number of meters. The largest residential loads are broken out separately as tabs. The temps are from the research/weather folder. Initially, I am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation. We can refine things a bit later. Jason 
  Jim,  I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount of load in the area, and I was just curious if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of. I appreciate whatever help you can provide. Thanks,  Jason Wolfe Trading Analyst Enron North America 713-853-0568 
 Dave,  What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load. It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet. If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.  Thanks, Jason 
 ok

  did you let everyone know? how about tomorrow? 
 dear God!!!!!! Not....  The TOUR 
 The zone and UNA meter exist in sitara already. Two of the five meters that will be assigned by schedulers need to be set up. As it is, the zone is mapped to Socal curves - but should be PG&E as you said below. Jason 
 It will be mapped to PG&E Topock Index and the PG&E Large Pkgs Gas Daily. 
  Patti, Stacey,  The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as - Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission Zone: Las Vegas Facility: UNA - Las Vegas  It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of - Harry Allen (2-4015) Apex (2-4002) Blue Diamond (2-4016) Pecos (2-4013) Lone Mountain (2-4012)  Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.  The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.  Let me know what you think. Thanks, Jason

 Marvin,  Attached is the list of points. I need the general location and/or zone.  What is the nature of the Southend Balancing point (603)? There is a Northend Balancing, but it has no volume. Is Elmore Delivery M/S (616) a residential load? What is Florida River reciept (599)?  Thanks for your help.  Jason Wolfe Trading Analyst Enron North America 713-853-0568

 I'm up on all that. I was on my way to Portland, so couldn't pick up Canidate. However, it looks like Faulk only has bruised bone and will be back in 1-2 weeks. Shaun Alexander was the big miss, that guy could be a stud. We won again, and are 4th in the league with a good shot to win our next 2. Surprising, considering how shitty Thrash has become.  I will be back from Portland Wed night so I will probably see you at some point. J 
 Well, go find Glen Cook's The Black Company to start a less deep, but still entertaining, series. 
 Keith, I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these respective meters on NWPL:  Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472 Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446 Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227 Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302  Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not nominate through the Cascade LDC? This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.  Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the above plants closed or reduced capacity.  I appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks,  Jason Wolfe Trading Analyst Enron North America 713-853-0568

 You need to have these things at a time when I'm available. I don't get off work before 5:30. 
 I vote for the 25th also. Wait... do I get a vote? Jason 
 Karen, Sorry but lunch will be impossible. That week is bid week; also I will be covering for someone else who somehow got approved for vacation during this busy time. Jason Wolfe 
 That is awesome. You must have been jizzing non-stop since the All-Star break.  The only Big-Unit I recognize is the one from UH:  me. 
 You didn't answer if you would clean more or less boats this year than the last guy.  And yes, I am with Beth.  And yes, I am still a stud-cowboy. 
 I'm always hanging out...   of my pants!  That said, perhaps I can get more casual... It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need some quality time.  Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat. 
 So Tara is definitely returning?  Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job? Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in your position in the history of Triumph Boats?  BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore. 
 So when does Tara have to commit to Big E?  Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of the hull.

 Cards win indeed. I like them for the series. Are you cleaning fishing boats, too? 
 The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending. If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.  But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted). Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to: 2300 W Alabama  Apt 6 Houston, TX 77098  Thanks, Jason 
 I'm sorry, I didn't receive the text of your reply. Jason 
 Ms. Ridinger:  I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United States and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have the Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm the DRNs for the other three. If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks, Jason Wolfe Trading Analyst Enron North America 713-853-0568 
 is this true? 
 Sergei, To avoid duplicates I would prefer to pay for only the 18 Big Stalin Russian Political Posters (1013259638). Thank you very much for your understanding. I am transferring funds to Paypal now in the amount of: $16.50 (item) + $27.50 (shipping) = $44.00 (total)  In 3-4 business days a Paypal transfer will be made to ezyroll@aol.com.  Is this shipping from overseas? If so, perhaps this should be insured. Let me know. My address is:  JASON WOLFE 2300 W ALABAMA  APT 6 HOUSTON, TX 77098  Thanks, Jason 
 Mark, I am transferring funds to Paypal, which will take a couple days. I am including $2 insurance (total 66.85). When you get notice that the payment is available, send product to:  JASON WOLFE 2300 W ALABAMA   APT 6 HOUSTON, TX 77098  Thanks, Jason 
 I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am excited about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in the first set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get any non-duplicates that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these sets?  Thanks for the product. Jason 
 I just got back from checking out the new building. It's sweet. J 
 The Index settles during bid week for the following month (last week of Sep for Oct) and is published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual "index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index. I know it is confusing. Jason 
 A few relevant points: 1) you WILL be attending"Art" 2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but you WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed. 3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacem
