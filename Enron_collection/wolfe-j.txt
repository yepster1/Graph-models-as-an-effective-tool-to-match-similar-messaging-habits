  When I saw this, I new that the dark Republican years would be over by 2004. Is their anyone more qualified in the areas of foreign policy, energy policy, political economics, or complex social issues than the Rev? We'll finally have the pimpin' leader that we need. 
 How about Skewers? 
 fascinating. I'd like to work at getting a piece 
 Dipak, Seattle/Tacoma is the summation of a large number of meters. The largest residential loads are broken out separately as tabs. The temps are from the research/weather folder. Initially, I am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation. We can refine things a bit later. Jason 
  Jim,  I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount of load in the area, and I was just curious if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of. I appreciate whatever help you can provide. Thanks,  Jason Wolfe Trading Analyst Enron North America 713-853-0568 
 Dave,  What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load. It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet. If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.  Thanks, Jason 
 ok

 The zone and UNA meter exist in sitara already. Two of the five meters that will be assigned by schedulers need to be set up. As it is, the zone is mapped to Socal curves - but should be PG&E as you said below. Jason 
 It will be mapped to PG&E Topock Index and the PG&E Large Pkgs Gas Daily. 
  Patti, Stacey,  The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as - Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission Zone: Las Vegas Facility: UNA - Las Vegas  It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of - Harry Allen (2-4015) Apex (2-4002) Blue Diamond (2-4016) Pecos (2-4013) Lone Mountain (2-4012)  Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.  The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.  Let me know what you think. Thanks, Jason
