 You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.  Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.  Behave yourself girl. 
 Did she show you her tatoo?  I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  Your the boss, what do you think? 
 We are looking for a copy of the agency agreements between ENA and CES, and ENA and CEM.  Would you be a sweetie and see if you have copies of the agencies in your files?  And if you do, please fax me a copy.  humbly yours chris 
 Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters?  2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume  Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.  Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this. 
 How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)? 
 Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct? 
 Hey Jeff, we are meeting tomorrow because Molly is out today.  Is that OK? 
 You De Man.  Could you change the spelling from Druckett to Dracut?  I owe you a Chic Fil A  lunch. 
 I will have training class on the East Desk Market Area positions this Wed, June 21st, at 4:00 PM in conference room EB3084.  I will be discussing our operational flexibility with respect to Tenn Z6 and National Fuel. 
 The demand charges match what ENA was billed by the pipeline. 
 Buy or sell at 4.15????? 
 Are you inviting your woman to this?  I may need to extend an invitation to Ingrid.

 Paul Leanza with Clinton may have a market for the Peoples Gas.  Dick wanted me to talk to you to see if it sounds ok.  Give me a call when you get a chance. 
 Cool 
 Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal.  Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

 Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.  The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the sitara.  We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.  thanks 
 Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow. 
 We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, $4.455, and $4.475.  Comment? 
 This is what I see so far for Ogy for May.  We need to buy the imbalance back that was created on the 3rd but we can chat later. 
 I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month.  On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth. On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.  This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000. 
 Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a problem but just in case. 
 I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.  Transco Offers #20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to Algon #20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to Algon  CNG Offers #13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to Leidy  #13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 14661.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
 I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading. 
 Done. 
 Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This affects our demand charges on CGAS. 
 We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.  Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know. 
 I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093.  Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August.  I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. 
 Try 713-646-6344 per the Enron Operator. 
 Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company. 
 John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.  I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price adjusted for dth??  I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563.  I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?  Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.  Let me know if anyone has any questions.  Thanks cg 3-4743

 its a good thing i a good looking stud! 
 I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. My mistake. 
 Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out.  This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.  East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing  CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so.  Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.  National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.  Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.  CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG. 
 I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000.  Deals 165415 and 165423. 
 I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000. The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.  Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow.  Thanks. cg 
 In today's Gas Daily, Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job! 
 Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS, Boss :o) 
 I just mailed you the CES and CEM agency agreements on Transco. 
 I thought the meter numbers were different. 
 Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.  Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq. 
 Hi! 
 I killed deal 233231.  The contract number was incorrect. 
 There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H.

You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H. Dale Rexrode Director, Producer Services & Business Development 
 Scott Goodell will be attending as well.  Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please? 
 May cash $4.00  June Numbers Nymx   $3.78 CNG Basis Bid  $.215 CNG Index Prem (.0075)  Net   $3.9875  actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95%  Fuel Cost at $4.00 = $4.00/(1-.0195) - $4.00 = $.08  Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08) 
 As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount.  In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August. 
 One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket. 
 WOuld you double check my NYMX position.  I bought another 10,000 day of June at 4.255 after 4:00 PM yesterday.  That purchase does not show up in this mornings report.j 
 Hey!!  You still exist!! 
 Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June? 
 We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.  ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES. 
 Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice?? 
 Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!! 
 I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything.  I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow. 
 Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right? 
 Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month.  EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde is going to check around. 
 Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch. 
 Please send copies of the VNG demand charge invoices to Denise Dodson.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. 
 Did Cove Point approve that? 
 New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.  There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.  This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically forget the "work".  If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever. 
 As usual, you are awesome!  Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them.  Thanks

 I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.  We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000  That's all for now. 
 0:/Logistics/Capacity/East/NE/CES/20004strg.xls 
 I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424. 
 Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.    Thanks 
 I agree with the rates below. 
 We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale. Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us. Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000 Type:  EFP Differential: $.235 Point:  Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999  Sitara Deals:  158716/227890   the price in sitara is Tco Index.  Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.  I will gladly give this to David.  Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara. Thanks. 
 We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been addressed? 
 I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.  Thanks 
 we will showing CES a bid today. 
 You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct. 
 FYI 
 Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.  Thanks.  We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more. 
 My girlfriend (and I have many of those) at Tetco told me to tell you to call Aurora at 713-627-5316.  Do you have your own phone yet?? 
 Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions. This is how it will work,  Deal #  Comment 268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume should not change.   The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.  This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.  Thanks 
 I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email. 
 Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's pricing.  TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.  I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it. 
 I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth to 95246 dth.  Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.  Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify which price is correct.  The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct. 
 Do you need a HUG??    :o)

 Kim, I'm at a CNG shipper meeting in Florida next Wed - Fri.     Enron North America Corp. 
 Molly will chat with you about this and Molly just found out about it.  Hi Molly!! 
 That little project has been killed.  I don't think Father needs another animal to take care of. 
 I send it to your work address tonight buddy.   You de Man. 
 I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport split out by East and Marketeast. 
 Just imagine a big smiley face with a tongue sticking out right here   ====> 
 FYI - PSE&G has 72,450 dt of primary capacity from Tenn Rivervale to PSE&G on Transco.

 I have a new toy! 
 This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.  Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money. 
 Deal 125925 has been replaced with deal 231766 and deal 125928 has been replaced with deal 234584.  Angie is all over this one. 
 Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet? 
 I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI   May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 3218, 3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 3213 for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.

 Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.  I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;  Meter 4743 4747 4741 4754 4771 4753 4794 4728 4700 4749 4751 9740 6335 6333 4794 4700 4850 ISRP84 FSRP3 2SRP9   Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions. 
 Steve, I don't think you need to be at our meeting.  We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow. 
 Kim, I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow.  Thanks 
 Hi gang.  I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal.  Around 1:30PM?  Let me know.  thanks 
 I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.  All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy. 
 Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks 
 Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.   Thanks. 
 I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify. 
 I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket?  Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on? 
 I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May.  Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May. 
 Hey, regarding deals 226462 and 258420, should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462? 
 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)? 
 I took the volumes to 0 on the following deals  Deal 257285 CES Exchange Buy and deal 257287 CES sale - term 4/1/2000 - 10/31/2000   Deal 257288  CES buy and deal 257289 CES Exchange sale - term 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Thanks 
 Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound correct to you?  Please let me know. chris 
 Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 1,210,121.  I will try to monitor the deal volume.  Thanks. 
 Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop? 
 We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet.  The deal number is 257878 and the price is $3.4884 ($3.39 + $.0984).

 I think Alicia fixed this last week.  Take a look and let me know. 
 It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working.  Take a look at deal 98243.  I just had to extend the date for May 31, 2000. 
 CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.  thanks 
 FYI 
 Has this been addressed? 
 They are all in really bad shape.  May is looking pretty good though. 
 Do you know if this has been addressed?     Stephanie Sever   03/27/2000 04:51 PM 
 "Moths"  A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making.  The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.  Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you naked?" he asks.  Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you."  "Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."  He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands.  "Who the fuck are you?" the man asks  "I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with."  The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"  The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.  "Those little bastards!" *

 Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301.  thanks 
 Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.  thanks

 You are the GREATEST!!!  Thanks for the book.  I'm going to do something nice for you someday,. 
 Please change the following deals to evergreen. Deals 231754 and 231748.   thanks 
 This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January.  The MDQ is 2300.  Thanks Joanie! 
 Do you guys know which contract this is? 
 Tetco k#892722, deal 207137 was terminated eff 4/1/2000.  FYI 
 Lizy, I don't know how you see these the next morning.  Please check deals 252056 (primary) and 252057, I just set these up in Sitara.  This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara.  Thanks. 
 Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins, Direcotor, Enron North America. 
 I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.  Thanks 
 This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.  Thanks Brenda. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to ENA - Im Market East.  This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 77563)  Thanks.  I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000. 
 We have our CES/Bug contract for May.  The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255. 
 Sorry, I sent this to you by mistake. 
 Just making sure everyone reads their emails.  The term is 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2001. 
 Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should give us 812 day injected for May.  This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May. 
 We have a new Cove Point Storage deal, here are the details; Term: 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2000 MSQ 360,000 MDWQ 36,000 Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April  $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March    $234,000.00/month Contract  FPS1024  The CPR storage injection deal is 246517, the withdrawal ticket is 249409.  I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March,. 
 UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify this information and let us know.

 I don't know a thing, but I think Mr. Goodell is an expert. 
 All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.  Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today.  We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some March) invoices. 
 Each month, Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES.  Please send him the Feb and Mar activity.  His phone number is 703-561-6472, his fax number is 703-561-7317.  You and I may need to chat. 
 I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet.  k#892722 - You De Woman!!!  k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318 k#892085 - deal 143319 k#892590 - deal 245855 - added to CES worksheet. 
 You may not see this deal come through the normal process.  Please set up deal 245855.  Thanks   Brenda, this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me. 
 Hi gang.  Lunch with CES is on Wednesday, that day works better with Jeff. 
 Hey, thats Mr. Turd to you. 
 I love being a MAN!!!  Ain't life great? 
 Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment. Robin called Roman and gave him the info.  thanks Joanie. 
 This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.  Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.  Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give Mark a copy.  Thanks. 
 Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.  Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 Sched Fee  $20,000.00  I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice. 
 Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.  AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that number. 
 Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.  I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What do you guys think? 
 According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?  thanks 
 Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;  Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000? What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? 
 Seen this one? 
 Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4.  I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.  I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge. 
 Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.  Thanks 
 What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price.  Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.  What do you think?? 
 I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.  I should have February to you by next week some time. 
 Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other.  Thanks 
 Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez?  Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached. 
 Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084. 
 FYI 
 The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.  This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals.  Which brings up the following issues; *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility. Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.  * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?  * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals  I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.  Thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please?  Thanks 
 Hey gang.  Joanie is still working on current day activity.  Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447.  I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day. 
 Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday, April 12th around 2:30pm.  thanks 
 OK.  Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume. 
 Don't I always get back to you within 10 min???? 
 uhhh - ok  <=== see no caps. 
 NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. 
 Chewies on the way!!!! 
 Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though. 
 I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.  The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm.   Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will be attending.  I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending. 
 Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1". 
 I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb.  They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.  Give me a call once you get these.  cg 
 Hey Sparky!  FYI. 
 Hey gang.  Dan caught my mistake.  Tenn fuels change in April.    March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.17%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9327 
 Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom. 
 This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.  Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.  2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.  Comments/questions? 
 Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed.  Comments? 
 Not bad.  Went to a John Zurita fish fry.  I rode to John's house with a power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work.  I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.

 How much is this hot date gonna set me back - $2,000??? 
 Here is the transport data for the Cook School Road   March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.28%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9294  Let me know what you come up with.  Thanks 
 Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone number? 
 I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.  Matt, why don't you go in my place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..  However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now. 
 We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 dts and the price is $2.22. I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a wholesale transaction. 
 We parked gas (deal 240072) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out (deal 240073) on the 10th.  ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily balance. 
 This is more CNG fuel waiver stuff.  Thanks 
 FYI, Joann scheduled the intra day. 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow moring.  I expect to be in around lunch time.  Thanks 
 Please unsuspend and bill the following Jan CES deals  Deal  Pipe volume  Amount  Comment 145311  ANR 5071  11992.92 we billed the Trunkline piece of this deal. 145317  ANR 37975  89810.88 145319  ANR 16275  38490.38    Still researching the following deals  Deal  Pipe volume  Amount  Comment 149430  ANR 34248  76030.56 sent email to Tom Donoho to research.   I will be in after lunch.  I may try to send you more deals. 
 I would path the April deal just like we did the previous deals, 102122 and 102121. 
 Present this email at a time of MY convenience and receive 1 free $.50 beverage from the 32 floor pop machine!!  Have we got perks or what! :o) 
 There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you did the deal with?  Thanks. 
 oh it is not.  You Lie! 
 Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;  "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".  If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thanks 
 I've been in you house since then.  I also have a doggie book in the back of my car that belongs to you. 
 C'mon - I want a free lunch.  I could interduce you to a new place, real close to work. 
 You bet.  Don't you think we could send something a little better? 
 I think I might call.  Would you take me our for a free lunch? 
 It looks like I'm missing demand charges on the following CES Transco contracts for January  k# 3.3053 3.3039 3.3109 3.3085 3.3115 2.4899 2.7160 2.8607 
 We received a prior period adjustment (December activity) on the JanuaryTransco invoices for CES.  Its a credit of $6,432.31.  Its releated to the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.  This credit should be passed through to CES.  How is that being handled? 
 As always, they catch me at my most beautiful pose. 
 Thanks. 
 Melissa, am I at liberty to discuss pricing information and to provide my price calculation worksheets (transport capacity and pricing worksheet) with Don Kirkendall? 
 Well, aren't you just full of wisdom! 
 I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.  I'm working fast and furious on March.  I was going to do most of April next week with Molly.  Can I give it to you then?  Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you are ok with that.  Just let me know.  I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins.  I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage.  For now, I will allow the intra day changes. 
 The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over.  Comments/questions? 
 Do we still need to be transporting Bridgeport CNG produciton gas through Coronado to CGAS?  AND if YES, will this gas always need to go through Coronado?  I thought that was just a seasonal thing 
 I think the National Fuel is local production.  I'm don't know how you would swing this volume. 
 I apologize for this.  May I get a copy of all the invoices we sent CES for January please. 
 Hi campers.  Its that time of month again, I need all the transport information for CES for March. 
 I do love chocolate malts though.  i guess that's what us low life forms live on. 
 Brian, I'm Fed Exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the following exceptions:  Transco:  I missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity charges.  I am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and I will be making a billing adjustment this Friday.  I have not review all the invoices I am sending you.  And I have made copies for Don.  I will give him his copies on Friday or Monday.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I've gone through most of the CES stuff for Jan.  I'm missing several demand charge contracts and commodity for CES on Trco.  I think you need to call me. 
 Big Bang??  Are you saying I was born out of the lowest form of life on earth? 
 I'm going through the Jan transport invoices.  I see I need to bill CES for some South Georgia activity.  How did we pay South Georgia, I don't see a matrix in Unify. 
 Actually, cheeseburger and a shake!! 
 I guess you won't be taking me out for a cheeseburger this evening will you ? 
 We can do that.  Brian, would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF invoices for January?  We will take care of everything else.  thanks 
 Hi Anita, my name is Chris Germany and my phone number is 713-853-4743.  My fax number is 713-646-8453.  I believe you and I will be working together. 
 Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday. He is requesting copies of the transport invoices.  Should I give the invoices to him or should I send them to Charlie? 
 I would like to have the following 2 speed dials added to Page 10,  CES DALP 703-561-6469  CES DOUG 703-561-6339   thanks 
 I faxed a copy of the PSNC invoice for March to Brian Perrone.  I show this as a purchase from CES at St 85.  Also, I believe March is the last month CES is taking the gas from CES.  Brian, I'm tossing my copy, let me know if you have questions.  Thanks. 
 Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round  OR  $.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.  The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in. 
 OK this is metered production on CNG.  Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with. The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES production.  After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal in Sitara with a zero volume. 
 If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool). If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production or pool gas on CNG? 
 Hey John, did CES take this gas for Jan, Feb, and Mar?  Wade would like to see this deal in the system. 
 I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April.  Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this. Also, send me your phone number.  I can't find it. 
 Hey dudes, we need someone to attend this.  I'm thinking Scott Goodell should go.  Let's chat. 
 T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.  Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.  CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999. T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.  T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to April 1, 2000.  John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question. 
 This deal has been entered a CNG South Citygate deal and it should be entered and CNG Appalachian production.  Jim Javins said he thought the deal was behind hastings.  Could you guys move it.  I would but Mr. Tengle yelled at me about messing up the risk assignments.

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification. On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines. The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at (304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.  April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00 11:10 am Posted 4/3/00 11:10 am  Dear Pool Operator:  CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in. The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.  Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool.  As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify producers individually.  We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled shut       down will not be until 2002.  If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to contact me at (304) 623-8698.  Sincerely,    Nancy M.

 I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th. Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's.  Thanks 
 Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May. This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to.  Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management group. 
 I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the transport. 
 Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need to address right away.  Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.  Thanks. 
 Hey, you should see us up here.  We are real nice and close.  I was out Friday and we moved from 31 to 32.  The schedulers are up here with us, although we are so far apart, you still need to use the squawk box to chat with 'em. 
 Transco Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed. Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.  Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next Wed.  Tetco We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.  CNG We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around to requesting them.  Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet.  I will be calling in the morining. 
 1.  May Only   $.4300 2.  May/Oct       $.4380 Jun/Oct         $.4400 Just wanted to show the diff between May and the rest of the summer.  Let me know how this looks.    3.  Nov/Mar  no offer 
 Hi Team!  I will be out of the office on Friday, March 31st.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have.  Later 
 Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is $2.40 = $.08.  Everything looks good except the recallable factor.    Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446. I can't get my machine to print out the forms.  Good Luck. 
 Glad to hear things are going well.  talk to you later,. 
 I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached.  I will discuss this with Charlie. 
 FYI 
 thanks 
 We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an "East" desk pipe as oppossed to "Market East".  Please let me know if you think there might be any problems.

 Opps! 
 Hi gang.  I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb.  We will have to look at it next week.  Deal 162283 and 162282.  We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois.  we will chat. 
 You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my capacity. 
 Mr. Monroy entered deal 218918 in Sitara on 3/15/2000 with a Tagg # NC3056. I don't know who this is.  Could you let me know which trader did this deal please.

 Look guys - I suspect these are deal entry problems as opposed to deal valuation problems.  Please take a look.   Should I just enter these deals in Sitara for now (just for April) and let you know what the new deal numbers are? 
 I would like to see the tickets for deals 100093 and 100096.  Thanks 
 Created deal # 231048 to net out against Z6 sales on 527 a day.  Molly 
 I'll be needing a "significant other" for the party.  Do you have any spares? 
 Please review the following discrepancy and let me know what the price should be. 
 Hi Steph.  Are you busy?  Look - work!! 
 I'm there.  I'm out Friday.  Also, Molly will be full time CES starting next week.  Kim, please reserve a room for a conference call for one hour starting at 11:00 am this Thursday. 
 Robin said you are going to be doing some of the Inside Ferc numbers.  I'm out Friday so I'm sending this to you now. 
 I don't remeber, who was taking care of changing the CES counterparties?  Was that someone in Global?

 Hey!!   It worked!  Ankle is ok.   I will start using your stock tips soon. 
 Anytime.  I'll buy you a beverage next time you come down. 
 Hi team.  FYI - I just received the CALP invoice for Feb today in my inbox. I mailed it to Mark just so he could have a non-faxed copy for his files. 
 ID cgerman Pword clg03mar    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have all of you set up in my group profile for CES now. 
 My fault.  I should have sent this out this morning. 
 Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059.  We did this exact setup on several contracts today. 
 All very good questions and NO, we don't have an anwser. 
 Hi team.  I may be inviting you to a chat on Thurs. 
 Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk.   Comments/questions? 
 I executed the Bug capacity for April.  Offer #16219, vol=103,  k#892865, deal numbers 229304/229314  I set it up under MarketEast and East with Market East as primary. 
 i'm all over it. 
 What's the word Mr. Goodell?  I'm thinking there is no demand charge and this acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand. 
 I sure did work hard on this didn't I? 
 You de' Woman!! 
 We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.  ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily balance on the 28th.  This gets confusing because we already have a parking deal from the weekend that comes out in April. 
 Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first? 
 I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other gathering contracts. 
 Hey, I just undid what I did because the deal already exist under ENA - Market East.  Thanks dude! 
 Hi Team!  I just extend CNG deal 116090 through 1/31/2001. 
 Oh it hurts so bad.  Sure wish I had a Diet Coke to take my mind off the intense pain. 
 281-693-7427 
 We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be taking it out during April (deal 225534).  ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt = $1,500.00 in April.  Please let me know if you have questions. 
 Earth day info. 
 Hey Pops!  Here is the deal.  If you can verify that you recieved this message, you can have Jerry's jet ski.   That's right, its FREE!!  Just call me up within 10 days from the receipt of this email and say the word "BULL" and you've got yourself one semi-used jet ski. 
 Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.  I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.  Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct? 
 Them's fightin words!  Ahh my poor ankle.  It's just about time for me to leave I think. 
 I'm thinking about getting a "Hang Glidin" tatto. 
 You know all and see all.  Who can I start sending all these pricing questions to?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Yep.  I'm a wild man now. 
 What do I get if I break the chain? 
 That stuff will just make you fat!  You keep that up and you will never have a slim & trim figure like I do!! 
 Right.  Price for 24th is $2.88 - .005= $2.875 
 I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.  Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas from CES at GD - $.005  Let me know if you have questions. 
 I guess my new address is chris.germany@enron.com 
 Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?  I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in Sitara.  Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara. 
 According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS + .015.  I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001. 
 Yuck!  Some of this looked spooky.  Baseball tickets:  you and your buddy Maureen go to the game on Tuesday, June 6th.  I believe the Astro's play MIN. 
 Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport (at least with the way things work in our systems). 
 I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara (deal 224977) effective 4/1/200 thru 10/31/2000.  Dick, Scott, the sales price is trigger deal priced at  NX1 + $.22. Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the CGAS pool.  My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus (phone 412-394-2953).  David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through Dick's book. 
 This is ok for March. 
 Is Dayton showing the price to be 1.  $2.47 and $2.455  2.  $2.47 +.17 and $2.455 + .17?  To me it looks like options 2.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I need to pull my tapes for Jan 21st.  Would you take care of that please? 
 What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?  The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I entered it in Sitara deal 223022.  Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify. 
 pulled up deal 158501 and added a demand charge for k#66394 
 i added deal 223021, cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara.  what is this capacity for?  its FTS 1 at rate $1.1600 
 Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow but I will call her.  Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next. 
 Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know. 
 That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last day of the month. 
 I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite, Mr. Goodell will be a busy fellow.  I think I visit Tahitti 
 For Jan, the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $200.00    Enron Capital Management 
 I don't think 3rd times a charm.  Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy??? 
 I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.  CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648  I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the worksheet.  Comments/Questions? 
 That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke??? 
 Looks pretty empty so far. 
 Kewel!!! 
 funny.  Oh my poor foot.  Noone cares about me. 
 I always have time for you.  I'm out all day tomorrow. 
 For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.   Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.  1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At today's prices we save:  Savings Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88 ------------ Total Savings $.1151  At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie  2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of $.04 to $.06.   Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer. 
 I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st. Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool (deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.  2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline. 1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.  Price = $2.77 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach .0250  demand charge --------- 2.8995 CGAS price.    Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 9:30 and 10:00 
 It's not in the worksheet. 
 I tried calling you last night but your phone just kept ringing.  AND, John Kinder called me this morning and told me I didn't get my capacity.  He said the winter goes for max rate and I bid $.16, but the goober would not give me a good feel for what it went for. 
 I updated the Transco rates and fuel for April.  It is in the "Offseason Rate" tab in the "2000tran03" file. 
 Done!  What's next? 
 I will assume you de' man on this one. 
 This deal terminates effective 3/31/2000.  FYI - all BUG terminate effective 3/31/200. 
 Hey Buddy, would you change my email address to Chris.Germany@enron.com please.  Thanks 
 Hey Doug, could you change my email address in your system to Chris.Germany@enron.com  thanks 
 I had this filed in the wrong spot.  These are John's citygate production deals. 
 I sold another 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES (Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 221731) . 
 The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of you is it?  I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this. 
 I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices.  Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff.  However, I getting copies as I work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan.  I will make copies an send them to Brian.  Brian, what is your mailing address? 
 I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 6.423 (deal 205687).  I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).  We were billed 6.423 in January.  That's an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50. 
 220903 
 What's your work number?  I'm updating my Lotus Notes Database and I left my day planner at home - too much weight in the backpack. 
 I just set up a new storage contract for Egan Hub Partners.  Deal 205633. 
 Good.  I'll be expecting you. 
 I changed the price on deal 145638.  I show we should make about $19,000.00. Let me know what you see,. 
 Ohh my poor ankle!!  Do you care? 
 Let's try this again.  I now have all the deals.  Today, I took the price to 0 for the following deals 209176 and 209178.  All the other deals do not have any pricing.  I would like to know the economic impact of taking the prices out before Scott see this in the morining report. 
 Nope. 
 Nope. 
 I extended Sitara deal 143323 thru march.  This is a Boston Gas release to CES SS-1 contract.  Should we release this to ENA? 
 I made a mistake the Borrowed deal is 220270 the payback deal is 220254 
 Please set up the following Service Type, Rate Sched combinations.  Pipe Code EGHP Firmness Firm Service Type Storage Rate Sched FSS Term  Term   thanks 
 As you all know I'm handicapped and its not because I'm a agiee.  Borrowed 10,000 dt from CNG Transmission intraday on the 17th, deal 219976. Payback 10,000 dt over the weekend, 18th-20th, deal 219982. ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the ending daily balance.  Please let me know if you have any questions. thanks  3-4743 
 I guess we won't be having dinner for a while, huh? 
 The web site is in the first paragraph.  Have fun! 
 I understand.  I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES.  If we used it to serve CES, I should have called CES to negotiate a price and thats what I don't see in my records. 
 FYI - need an upgrade on the 22nd.  thanks 
 Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.  When you get back, let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes. 
 Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA which is good enough for me.  I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to Sylvia.  Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also, the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way. Let me know if you have questions.  thanks cg 
 I want to make sure Joni sees everyting on CGAS as well. 
 I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several pipelines.  Who should I talk to?  On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and sell the gas to CES on injections.  On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how to do it.  Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage? 
 Would you guys please give the latest CGAS number for CES?  You know, thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA, CALP, and Dayton transport.   Thanks 
 Angie, please send any CNG EBB postings pertaining to Appalachian production to John, Jim, Heidi, Scott, Dick and myself.  I don't think Dick knows what email is but send it to him anyway.  Also, when in doubt about the email, send it anyway.  EES probably sends the same thing to John, Jim and Heidi.  thanks   MARQ CAPACITY AVAILABLE                               Received 3/15/00 3:20 pm Posted 3/15/00 3:20 pm    CNG Transmission will accept bids for the following MARQ capacity, which is available for service commencing April 1, 2000.

 My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing. 
 Nope.  Cove Point is a wholesale asset. 
 Nope.  I think Gloria is though.  I know Victor is but he is out the rest of this week. 
 Robin purchased 8500 dts from Con Ed intra day on the 15th.  These are the changes I made in Transit on contract 3.2067  Activity  Prev Volume New Volume 767169  25000  15000  Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 6571 down by 10000 789154  0  1500  Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 1183 up by 1500 789274  0  8500  ???

 There is only a small chance that I will attend.  Vic, make sure and/or Angie go. 
 AND you are a good cook and you smell good too! 
 Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61. The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell him.   I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport). 
 And modest too. 
 CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur, or Fri.  Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like to meet with CNG.  I may or may not be here.  Thanks 
 I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace else.  The monthly demand charge is $125,000.00. 
 Attached is the storage schedule for CES.  Scott, according to Colleen, this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track. 
 I got it.  Thanks 
 I spoke with Brian at CES .  He does not show this deal in his records.  I don't show it in my records either. 
 Would you research this please?  Thanks 
 Hey, I'm not going to the party tonight.  My William's ticket is yours. 
 I'm so sorry.  I hope things go well for you. 
 I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775  Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that. 
 Hey - whats this "was" stuff???? 
 Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of invoices at one time? 
 Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000.  My contact, Brian Perrone, said he has not seen them. 
 Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files "febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to CES for the month of Feb.  The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual process.  I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.  Thanks. 
 Kim is taking care of that invoice.  Thanks 
 Is your Gain ID "ONX1666"? 
 Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok. 
 How did it go? 
 I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below.  Please call me when you get a chance.  Thanks 
 Nope.  It probably should.  It would also be flashed as a reimbursement. 
 1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.  2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those 3 people.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file. I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with you later today.    Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet. 
 I think we are good to go. 
 Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.  I just entered a volume for the last day of the month.  You don't need to do this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th. Then retrack and balance.  Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.  You should be able to apply the payments to these deals. 
 Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production? 
 Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be somewhere around $16.00. 
 Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this. 
 Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day. Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having. 
 CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.  The request was made by Kim Novesak??  I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.  Thanks 
 I will not be attending. 
 DON'T GIVE IN UNLESS YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT!!  Good luck! 
 Go get 'em Tiger. 
 You D' MAN!! 
 Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each month.  True?   March 10, 2000   SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE  NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:   In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.  If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April.  If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041.  Thank you.   Janice Bailey Manager Transportation Services Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

 I believe Beverly uses this to get the gas from Nat Fuel to Transco.

 Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY" 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".  That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!  What's up with you girl? 
 Same thing on k#65403 And k#65534 - I left this one in red. 
 Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to Sitara. 
 Looks good.   Stephanie Sever   03/08/2000 05:35 PM 
 Hey! 
 Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti.  His phone number is 713-853-6320.  I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek numbers (with Scott Goodell as my backup).  I will forward the bid week numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers. After bidweek, you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and myself for all East Desk issues.  Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

 Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.  For CNG, I would prefer to have the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.  Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are starting April? 
 Opps.  Wrong worksheet 
 This is what I have.  Good luck. 
 How does this deal work - deal 165385? 
 Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path those deals and email Mark when you are done.  Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000. 
 Personally, I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17" wheels.  To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool. 
 Did you get the PSNC invoice?  Can I throw mine away now? 
 I have mixed comments on Dodge's.  I think either of the other vehicles are perfect. 
 Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis? 
 I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot was facing North East.  I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".   He popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.  I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.  What are you looking for in a truck? 
 Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings, Bridgeport ...) 
 Not for me,  I'm injured - I dislocated my ankle on Sunday. 
 Who wuz receiving the bills on contracts 2.6598 and 2.6592 in December?  Wuz it CES or Union Camp?  Thank U 
 Hi.  I will not be able to attend because I'm dislocated my ankle and I'm crutchin it now. 
 I luv trucks.  I was injured on Sunday,  I use crutches now. 
 This is just about my intelluctual speed.    Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. You move like the bass which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'.  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, We two go together like a skunk goes with stank.  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth.  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you.  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

 Just a note.  Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St 85 or the PSNC transport.  This is a new contract each month - we are currently shipping 145 dt's. 
 Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand.  AGL released CES some ESR (offer #18307) and WSR (offer #18210).  The demand portion of these contracts being billed on k#1.3473.  What's up. 
 Just to keep you in the loop.  I have not responed to any of these questions yet. 
 Hey Team!  Ms.  "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now.  Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues.  She will be the one setting this up in Sitara in the future.  Thanks.

 Scott misspelled your name.  I hope I have the right guy.  I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.  Thanks cg 
 I wish I could write such sweet words.  There are starting to be way to many Driscoll's, I think there was a Mark and Mike that I came close to sending this to.    Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. You move like the bass which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'.  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, We two go together like a skunk goes with stank.  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth.  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you.  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor! 
 You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.  1.  Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail. The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.  2.  Contract 3.3509 - ???  I don't understand this one.  Take a look at k#1.3473.  Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand estimated in Sitara?  I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.  Let me know what you find. 
 I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract. We have so many.  Do you have a Sitara deal number? 
 Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.   Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing scenarios." 
 Bryan, it doesn't line up very well but this shows that we received 150 dth at St 85 and delivered 145 to PSNC.   03/01/00                                TRANSCONTINENTAL GAS PIPE LINE CORPORATION                             REPORT NO.: GCS1060B 13:40:11                       DAILY BILLABLE PARTY TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULE QUANTITY REPORT                              PAGE:   16 ALL QUANTITIES IN DTS BILLABLE PARTY:   7973  ENRON NORTH                  GAS DAY: 03/01/00  TIMELY CYCLE     EVENING CYCLE      ID1 CYCLE        ID2 CYCLE  ---------------  ---------------  ---------------  --------------- CNTR NO.

 Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only.  Match deal 211356 with 211359.  thanks 
 I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES (Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 210987).  Who schedules this gas? 
 She's still a porker as of this morning. 
 Joe, it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity.  I'm not touching until you and I chat.  I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon. 
 I'm going to change the sell to CES on Monday for now.  I will chat with my CES counterpart this afternoon about how to treat this. 
 Done.  Deal 210603  I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her voodoo stuff, this deal will show up.  Ms.  Franklin, this might be my last contract to set up (he he he <=== evil snicker!). 
 Do you think Scott should go to this?? 
 I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.  CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.   Comments? 
 Call me if you have questions. 
 Uhhh- you bet! 
 M, these deals should show up in Unify by lunchtime today.  Sherry, you guys should see this after lunch.  Thanks. 
 Meredith, please path deal 209359 with 209371 for Jan 31.  This should capture the meter bounce fee ENA owes Bay State.  Sherry, I don't remember who gave me this invoice.  I will leave it on your desk. 
 nuthing but retail stuff.  Why would anyone do retail stuff?

 Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting.  Example #1  Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of PECO in Z6. What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;  PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?  PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to Z6?   Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.  Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

Subject to the open-access requirements of Parts 161 and 284 of the Commission's regulations, unless mutually agreed otherwise in consideration of relevant operational and market factors, CNG reserves the right to reject any bids at less than its maximum applicable rates.  CNG also reserves the right to reject contingent bids and bids from any party that does not qualify for service in accordance with all applicable provisions of CNG's FERC Gas Tariff.  Bids for this capacity must be submitted to CNG by fax at (304) 623-8530, during the period from 10:00 AM (EST) February 29, 2000, through 10:00 AM (EST) on March 1, 2000.

 February 29, 2000                                       Received 2/29/00 11:30 am Posted 2/29/00  11:30 am  Dear Producers and Shippers,  In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed. Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:  1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,  2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.  We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you. If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.   Sincerely,   H. Dale Rexrode Director, Producer Services and Business Development 
 I love Chic Fe Le. 
 Good news, even better when it happens.  My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.  They still need to reconstruct January.  Billing I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES. I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.  I want to fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the scheduling fee. The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th. 
 Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport. Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.  Also, yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB.

 Did you get you Boston Gas setup taken care of? 
 FYI if you guys are interested. 
 It appears that the volume on the sale to CES-Woodward Marketing is 4000/day for March.  Tammi called Woodward to verify. 
 Please create a new CPR index report and have it sort 1st byPub Code, 2 nd by pipe, 3rd by zone.    Also, please subtotal by Pub Code. 
 We need to add Sonat to our CES retail demand charge sheet.  Let's chat.

 Let's see, got a freebie at the Blue Agave last night (Mexican food), they fed us Curmley's (crossaint sandwiches and tortilla soup) yesterday, breakfast yesterday and today and tomorrow and Monday.  I wonder what's for lunch tomorrow?  And I wonder why I have such a hard time loosing weight. 
 My techy's going to help me buy a computer.  I'm thinking of buying a Dell Pent III 600 Mhz with a bunch of other stuff I know nothing about and an HP8?? color printer.  I was also going to buy a digital camera and start taking a lot more family photo's and save them to disk.  What do you think?  I was also going to try and create a home page and keep track of the stuff I plan on doing.  1st up is Hang Gliding the first weekend in March.  I have not registered yet.  Cool huh?

 Nonono.  That profile is for Natasha - not me. 
 Hey.  It's international  friend week.  I'm sending Natasha an international friend email.  I'll send you the email that I send her.  Here is the profile I have built for her: 29 yr old, Teaches a children's Sunday School class, excellent piano player, believes in recycling, helps little old ladies across the street, loves arts and crafts shows, and bakes cookies!  What do you think.  What's your wife's name?  I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email. 
 Hey!  Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi?  Are you going to work for Enron?  We get discounted deal tickets to Astroworld every April - you don't want to miss that!! 
 CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the month CGAS price.  Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth of deal 159319.  We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on the 24th.  I will let you know if things change. 
 You go girl! 
 Always a pleasure  :o) 
 I didn't have this email when I left yesterday. 
 I knew we would have to address this eventually.  CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into CGAS at Lebanon.  This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer. 
 I sold 7000 to CES at the Allied meter for tomorrow - deal 169576.  Joann, let the Tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at Broad Run. 
 I just created "2000bug03.xls" and "2000tran03.xls".  Joe, we will continue to use the CES Wholesale tab in the 2000tran03 worksheet. 
 My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January.  Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.  We probably will not be able to cover everything at once.  We still have a few items to bill.  I will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them. 
 Does any of this impact the Central Desk? 
 FYI, not the markets I was hoping to see. 
 GET OUT!  No Way?  I think I'll change something in the system. 
 I think its just the demand charge.  Algon only has 2 firm commodities that we have worked with and both are fairly cheap.  Most of the Algon expense is in the demand charge. 
 I included this on my worksheet.  Here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend.  Pager  800-978-1788  does not work at my Dad's house.

 I just sent you and email.  Feel free to mention my name to Ishi.  More names later today! 
 Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.  I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700). Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not make them an offer.  Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.  But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat with.  I get you more scoop later. 
 Bay States will be sending us an invoice for an Algonquin meter bounce fee. I would like to see when it gets here.  It's not in the system, but Meredith and I will take care of after I get the invoice.  Please call me if any of you come accross it.  thanks cg 3-4743 
 When you get a chance would you redraft the CES invoice and call me?  Thanks 3-4743 
 I promise to be a perfect gentleman (or as perfect as an Aggie can be).

 You're probably gone anyway.  I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".   Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars."  Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word.  They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars." 
 Jim asked me to forward this to you.  We should probably discuss this.

 Brian with CES just called me and asked if we could take the cut at Colonial?  Let me know. 
 We bought 8000 (deal 160324) and sold it to CES in CPA 4-25 (deal 160327) for the 2nd. 
 My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd.  Brian, do we need to do anything for the 1st? 
 Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  Please let me know how you sourced the gas. 
 Opps - for gas flow day 2/1/2000. 
 Per my discussion with Joann, it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at meter 80-03 on CGAS. 
 CES was cut 7314 at WGL on CGAS for the 1st.  I sold CES the gas on TRCO for the 1st and the 2nd (deal 159474). 
 Reminder 
 I just updated the transport rate and corrected some of the points. 
 I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor.  The price is $3.06.  Could you get me the meter numbers?  This is what I have so far  COH Mrkt Area Monthly Vol Meter 7 5  700 7 1  1141 7 1  682 7 5  1993 7 5  2881 8 5  5534 9 5  12309 5 2  1577 
 I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you.  Do you have any comments to add?  I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and ask them how they would like for me to handle this.   Do not share any of this with CES.  Thanks. 
 Hi team.  Guess what day it is??!! 
 I just sold CES 8980 day for 1st and 2nd at the CGAS pool for International Paper - deal 159101. 
 We still have CGLF and CGAS contracts showing up as CES and Columbia Market in Navigator.  Scott and I will look at contracts 42789, 63115, and 66278. Please let Scott know if you need any of the remaining contracts moved over to ENRON N A.  Thanks.

 How about we move it to ENA. 
 Has CES global contract  96030669 / 65071 been transferred from CES to ENA? 
 We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal (deal 158112) and sold to EES (deal 158120) for the 29th-31st.  This gas is coming from Allied Signal.  Lee Tippet thought the contract number was 62672.  Joany, would you verify that, thanks. 
 Just wanted to make sure you received this. 
 We have a 2500 dt/day supply from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  This deal is matched with a term sale to FirstEnergy (deal 145648 for Jan and deal 157848 for Feb and Mar).  This is a John Singer deal.  I have no idea what the price is on the sale to FirstEnergy. 
 This is ok.  I sold them 767 for the 27th and 28th.  I told Bryan to make sure he doesn't need the 767 for the 29th - 31st. 
 I just created a deal for TRCO contract 3.3433 (deal 157600).  This is the master contract for all ENA deals on rate schedule FTSR.  We will be doing nominations under this contract. 
 I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost for January, even if we did not get set up as agent, correct? 
 I replaced deal 155238 with 157242 and I fixed the metered volumes for the last day on deal 155244. 
 Bought from CPA (deal 157219) sold to CES (deal 157220) for the 29th-31st.

 I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America now has 3 storage contracts. 
 I hear we are staying at 68 for tomorrow at O&R. 
 where are you? 
 Thanks. 
 Hey!!  Where are you?  I'm about to go get my Dad a chocolate malt.  Today is his long day at the hospital.  He's probably still there. 
 How about Monday, Jan 31st for dinner??

 I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger?? 
 Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down. 
 We bought 4385 from CPA (deal 155237) and sold it to CES (deal 155238).  We bought 1249 from CPA (deal 155240) and sold it to EES (deal 155244).  Do the emails help??  Is this the way you guys want ot see this? 
 We bought 500 from COH (deal 155197) and sold it to CES (deal 155195) for the 26th.  This deal was done without Brian's approval.  He seemed mildly annoyed but I think he will forget about it. 
 We sold Cove Point gas to CES, the volume is 228 dth - deal 155139. 
 I'm forgot, what do you need at Tenn O&R for tomorrow? 
 We will deliver 46 dth to Tenn NYSEG meter 020221on contract 31533 at first of the month prices.  Also, we are selingl you the 600 dth of CNG delivered at $5.00 for the rest of the month.

 Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV. 
 This looks like IT stuff to me. 
 Should this deal be extended? 
 I think we chatted about this the other day.  I'm waiting to see if we actually get the retail deal before I send any notification.  Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb.  I wouldn't tell Steve its not a done deal yet.  Just tell him we are still working things out. 
 You must have put a lot of thought in this.  P 
 Would you send me an amtel at 3:00pm Wed, Jan 26 about my review?  Thanks 
 What did we do about this?  I'm thinking we let it flow. 
 I bet you think I have been ignoring you, right?  Does this mean I don't have to read all those emails you sent me? 
 Kim, please send Victor and myself an amtel message at 11:00am AND at 1:30pm on Feb 1 to attend the meeting below.  Please include the room and time on the amtel.  I think it will be a busy day.  Thanks 
 We should chat about CALP and Dayton Power & Light. Victor, should we invite Joany? 
 Do you mean an ENA sale to Keyspan? 
 Deal 150348.  I have it in Sitara as  833 day for the 15th-31st.  This deal is secondary recallable, which means the gas don't flow if secondary transport gets cut. 
 I'm at work, where are you?? 
 I made a couple of changes.  This worksheet will be your top priority for Friday. 
 Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for that?  The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.  I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this worksheet tomorrow.

 Please check on the actual storage capacity volume on FSS contract 63304. I'm showing 7,503,838 dth and I'm thinking it might be closer to 7,000,000.  Thanks 
 I forgot about this deal. 
 Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails.  Here is what your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct. 
 Sorry it took so long.  I believe this was the last email I sent out. 
 This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, please let me know if this is incorrect.  ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.  Comments/questions?  Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara. 
 Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch.  Supply Deal Market Deal 153071  153057 153096  153135 153109  153109  The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES.  Originally these deals were done for the 21st, I just extended the date and the volumes through the 24th.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 My good buddy Scott set up contract .9047 in Sitara.  Please note:  do  not schedule gas on this contract.  This contract was set up for accounting purposes only. 
 I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco.  I'm assuming you and Ms. Jordan are taking care of everthing on that.  Also, if you ever need to send transport contracts to Houston, its best to send it to Sylvia Campos. She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper.  So send her allllll of your paper.

 I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS. 
 Not yet.  However, the contract is valid because Vickie is using it. 
 deals 136749 & 149838  Thanks Buddy 
 Done - take a look. 
 I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans? Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me). Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.  Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.  Thanks 
 The Equitrans capacity deals exist!! 
 I just created deal 149901, an Equitrans, capacity deal.  I populated all the fields because Sylvia Campos had created the information prior to my creating the deal.  After I released the deal, the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred. 
 No replying this late at night.  Then I don't have an excuse for not doing my job. 
 Email works good.  Do you know which deal I should put that on? 
 This is in Sitara. 
 We know about this don't we Judith!!!

 Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF +.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.  The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

 I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.  Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.  As far as I can tell, ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues. 
 I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES Retail fuel management deal.  ENA has the right to use the capacity and does all the nominations on the CALP contract.  I still need the counterpart set up.  Thanks  Victor,  for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 149776).  We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and unconstrained citygates.  Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.  For January, we will treat this as an exchange.  We need to chat about Feb and March.

 -   Why Exercise???  1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is.  2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again.  3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks. Haven't lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.  4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing.  5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body.  6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.  7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.  8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.  9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.  10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of my glass.

 CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete.  Here are my questions/comments;  1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange. I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC. If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.  2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due.  3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?  4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who should he talk to about that??   Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.  Thanks 
 Please reserve a conference room for the people listed above at 3:00 PM, tomorrow.  Mr. Javins will be present via conference call.  thanks

 CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to FirstEnergy.  Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day. I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.  Comments? 
 What type of IT contract is CES contract #.6187??  The contract description in Transit is Case-Pomeroy & Company, Inc.  Hmmm? 
 I need a new pipeline set up.  CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.  All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.  Name:   Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership Internet Address: http://www.latec.com/covepointlng/ Curve:   Tetco M3   This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on CGAS.  We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st.   Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?  Please let me know what I need to do. 
 Hows your day 
 Done again. 
 I agree, you stay home.  He didn't have any info on the test. He was ready to go., 
 Beavy??  I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up.  I know I need to set up IT contracts in Sitara.  And I think the agencies with other counterparties is at the bottom of the pile.  Comments 
 Pop's just called me.  He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying in the Hotel.  He is going home now, and will drive back tomorrow for the test results. 
 I'm sorry.  I forgot to mention Kathy and I can't find these deals in our system. 
 Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.  1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.  2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.  Do you know anything about these deals? 
 Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format? We may not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).  What do you think? 
 Which pipe? 
 You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is cushy?????? 
 You are wonderful!! 
 Is the TCO capacity from Eagle Point considered Retail or Wholesale? 
 Done, I think. 
 CNG SAbine contact is Alain Diza 713-752-7690. 
 Final Final numbers?? 
 Victor verified that the TCO storage is at 0.  He entered a volume of 1DT and the deal number is 143337. 
 How much of this capacity do we have for the first?

 Hey team, I entered a sale of 10,659 in M3 for the 1st (deal 144104).  This does not include anything that has PECO-PA gas.  Morgan and/or Phil have to help me figure out what that is. 
 I'm thinking about seeing them tomorrow - lettin' em chill.  I'm going to try to make the Thursday 4:00PM appointment. 
 I don't understand the PA gas for Peco comments.  Can you guys clear this up for me? 
 I don't think there are any Central Desk changes. 
 Robert, please check on this with the TCO schedulers and let me know what you find out.  Thanks 
 Please discuss this with Morgan.  I didn't know CGV had a delivery point off Transco. 
 Colleen will be attending via conference call. 
 David, I like to be include on the emails but I believe this will come from your people.  Let me know if I need to do something. 
 Please set up a m
