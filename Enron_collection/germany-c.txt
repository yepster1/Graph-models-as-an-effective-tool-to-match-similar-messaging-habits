 You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.  Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.  Behave yourself girl. 
 Did she show you her tatoo?  I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  Your the boss, what do you think? 
 We are looking for a copy of the agency agreements between ENA and CES, and ENA and CEM.  Would you be a sweetie and see if you have copies of the agencies in your files?  And if you do, please fax me a copy.  humbly yours chris 
 Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters?  2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume  Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.  Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this. 
 How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)? 
 Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct? 
 Hey Jeff, we are meeting tomorrow because Molly is out today.  Is that OK? 
 You De Man.  Could you change the spelling from Druckett to Dracut?  I owe you a Chic Fil A  lunch. 
 I will have training class on the East Desk Market Area positions this Wed, June 21st, at 4:00 PM in conference room EB3084.  I will be discussing our operational flexibility with respect to Tenn Z6 and National Fuel. 
 The demand charges match what ENA was billed by the pipeline. 
 Buy or sell at 4.15????? 
 Are you inviting your woman to this?  I may need to extend an invitation to Ingrid.

 Paul Leanza with Clinton may have a market for the Peoples Gas.  Dick wanted me to talk to you to see if it sounds ok.  Give me a call when you get a chance. 
 Cool 
 Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal.  Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

 Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet.  The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the sitara.  We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.  thanks 
 Let us update the pricing and we will send you a confirm today or tomorrow. 
 We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, $4.455, and $4.475.  Comment? 
 This is what I see so far for Ogy for May.  We need to buy the imbalance back that was created on the 3rd but we can chat later. 
 I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month.  On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth. On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.  This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000. 
 Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a problem but just in case. 
 I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.  Transco Offers #20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to Algon #20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to Algon  CNG Offers #13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to Leidy  #13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 14661.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
 I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading. 
 Done. 
 Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This affects our demand charges on CGAS. 
 We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.  Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know. 
 I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093.  Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August.  I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. 
 Try 713-646-6344 per the Enron Operator. 
 Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their customers to another company. 
 John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG.  I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price adjusted for dth??  I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563.  I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?  Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.  Let me know if anyone has any questions.  Thanks cg 3-4743

 its a good thing i a good looking stud! 
 I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. My mistake. 
 Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out.  This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.  East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing  CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so.  Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.  National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.  Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.  CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG. 
 I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000.  Deals 165415 and 165423. 
 I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000. The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.  Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow.  Thanks. cg 
 In today's Gas Daily, Northern Natural Gas has a help wanted ad - you probably aren't doing your job! 
 Just be nice to me when you become my BOSS, Boss :o) 
 I just mailed you the CES and CEM agency agreements on Transco. 
 I thought the meter numbers were different. 
 Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.  Can you provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq. 
 Hi! 
 I killed deal 233231.  The contract number was incorrect. 
 There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H.

You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.  Sincerely, H. Dale Rexrode Director, Producer Services & Business Development 
 Scott Goodell will be attending as well.  Could you make sure he is covered for lunch please? 
 May cash $4.00  June Numbers Nymx   $3.78 CNG Basis Bid  $.215 CNG Index Prem (.0075)  Net   $3.9875  actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95%  Fuel Cost at $4.00 = $4.00/(1-.0195) - $4.00 = $.08  Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08) 
 As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our "approved" max monthly injection amount.  In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in the month of August. 
 One free soda for you upon request and providing I have $.50 in my pocket. 
 WOuld you double check my NYMX position.  I bought another 10,000 day of June at 4.255 after 4:00 PM yesterday.  That purchase does not show up in this mornings report.j 
 Hey!!  You still exist!! 
 Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June? 
 We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.  ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES. 
 Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice?? 
 Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!! 
 I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything.  I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow. 
 Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right? 
 Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month.  EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde is going to check around. 
 Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I'm always willing to drive for a free lunch. 
 Please send copies of the VNG demand charge invoices to Denise Dodson.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. 
 Did Cove Point approve that? 
 New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.  There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.  This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically forget the "work".  If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever. 
 As usual, you are awesome!  Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you get them.  Thanks

 I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.  We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000  That's all for now. 
 0:/Logistics/Capacity/East/NE/CES/20004strg.xls 
 I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424. 
 Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.    Thanks 
 I agree with the rates below. 
 We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale. Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us. Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000 Type:  EFP Differential: $.235 Point:  Tco Pool Trans Date: 5/6/1999  Sitara Deals:  158716/227890   the price in sitara is Tco Index.  Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.  I will gladly give this to David.  Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara. Thanks. 
 We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been addressed? 
 I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.  Thanks 
 we will showing CES a bid today. 
 You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct. 
 FYI 
 Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.  Thanks.  We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more. 
 My girlfriend (and I have many of those) at Tetco told me to tell you to call Aurora at 713-627-5316.  Do you have your own phone yet?? 
 Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions. This is how it will work,  Deal #  Comment 268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume should not change.   The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.  This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.  Thanks 
 I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home to show a photo email. 
 Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's pricing.  TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.  I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it. 
 I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth to 95246 dth.  Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.  Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify which price is correct.  The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct. 
 Do you need a HUG??    :o)

 Kim, I'm at a CNG shipper meeting in Florida next Wed - Fri.     Enron North America Corp. 
 Molly will chat with you about this and Molly just found out about it.  Hi Molly!! 
 That little project has been killed.  I don't think Father needs another animal to take care of. 
 I send it to your work address tonight buddy.   You de Man. 
 I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport split out by East and Marketeast. 
 Just imagine a big smiley face with a tongue sticking out right here   ====> 
 FYI - PSE&G has 72,450 dt of primary capacity from Tenn Rivervale to PSE&G on Transco.

 I have a new toy! 
 This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.  Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money. 
 Deal 125925 has been replaced with deal 231766 and deal 125928 has been replaced with deal 234584.  Angie is all over this one. 
 Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet? 
 I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI   May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 3218, 3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 3213 for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.  I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.

 Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.  I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;  Meter 4743 4747 4741 4754 4771 4753 4794 4728 4700 4749 4751 9740 6335 6333 4794 4700 4850 ISRP84 FSRP3 2SRP9   Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions. 
 Steve, I don't think you need to be at our meeting.  We have room 3125B at 1:30 PM tomorrow. 
 Kim, I need a room from 1:30pm to 2:30pm tomorrow.  Thanks 
 Hi gang.  I want to meet tomorrow regarding the CES storage deal.  Around 1:30PM?  Let me know.  thanks 
 I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.  All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy. 
 Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks 
 Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.   Thanks. 
 I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on setting these contracts up for Unify. 
 I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket?  Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on? 
 I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May.  Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May. 
 Hey, regarding deals 226462 and 258420, should we take the volumes to 0 on deal 226462? 
 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)? 
 I took the volumes to 0 on the following deals  Deal 257285 CES Exchange Buy and deal 257287 CES sale - term 4/1/2000 - 10/31/2000   Deal 257288  CES buy and deal 257289 CES Exchange sale - term 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Thanks 
 Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound correct to you?  Please let me know. chris 
 Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 1,210,121.  I will try to monitor the deal volume.  Thanks. 
 Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop? 
 We sold 870/day starting 5/2 - 5/31 to CES for Timet.  The deal number is 257878 and the price is $3.4884 ($3.39 + $.0984).

 I think Alicia fixed this last week.  Take a look and let me know. 
 It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not working.  Take a look at deal 98243.  I just had to extend the date for May 31, 2000. 
 CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.  thanks 
 FYI 
 Has this been addressed? 
 They are all in really bad shape.  May is looking pretty good though. 
 Do you know if this has been addressed?     Stephanie Sever   03/27/2000 04:51 PM 
 "Moths"  A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in passionate love making.  The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.  Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you naked?" he asks.  Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here and get ready to recieve you."  "Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."  He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a naked man standing there clapping his hands.  "Who the fuck are you?" the man asks  "I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid of the moths you are having problems with."  The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"  The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.  "Those little bastards!" *

 Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301.  thanks 
 Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.  thanks

 You are the GREATEST!!!  Thanks for the book.  I'm going to do something nice for you someday,. 
 Please change the following deals to evergreen. Deals 231754 and 231748.   thanks 
 This capacity is in ENA's name and we have been billing CES the demand charge since January.  The MDQ is 2300.  Thanks Joanie! 
 Do you guys know which contract this is? 
 Tetco k#892722, deal 207137 was terminated eff 4/1/2000.  FYI 
 Lizy, I don't know how you see these the next morning.  Please check deals 252056 (primary) and 252057, I just set these up in Sitara.  This is a Tetco contract I forgot to set up in Sitara.  Thanks. 
 Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like. 
 Thanks for the reminder.  I just faxed a confirmation for Dick Jenkins, Direcotor, Enron North America. 
 I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.  Thanks 
 This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.  Thanks Brenda. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to ENA - Im Market East.  This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 77563)  Thanks.  I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000. 
 We have our CES/Bug contract for May.  The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract number is 893255. 
 Sorry, I sent this to you by mistake. 
 Just making sure everyone reads their emails.  The term is 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2001. 
 Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should give us 812 day injected for May.  This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May. 
 We have a new Cove Point Storage deal, here are the details; Term: 4/15/2000 - 3/31/2000 MSQ 360,000 MDWQ 36,000 Demand $.65 Demand Charge for April  $117,000.00 Demand Charge for May - March    $234,000.00/month Contract  FPS1024  The CPR storage injection deal is 246517, the withdrawal ticket is 249409.  I entered all the withdrawal volumes to come out of storage the last 10 days of March,. 
 UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify this information and let us know.

 I don't know a thing, but I think Mr. Goodell is an expert. 
 All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.  Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch with Don and Ernie today.  We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some March) invoices. 
 Each month, Ed Glaum with CES in Herndon needs an invoice copy of the BUG release to CES.  Please send him the Feb and Mar activity.  His phone number is 703-561-6472, his fax number is 703-561-7317.  You and I may need to chat. 
 I added all of these demand charges as "Actual" expense items to the 2000ces03 worksheet.  k#892722 - You De Woman!!!  k#892069 - added to deal 143316 k#892066 - added to deal 143315 k#892084 - added to deal 143318 k#892085 - deal 143319 k#892590 - deal 245855 - added to CES worksheet. 
 You may not see this deal come through the normal process.  Please set up deal 245855.  Thanks   Brenda, this is for Tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me. 
 Hi gang.  Lunch with CES is on Wednesday, that day works better with Jeff. 
 Hey, thats Mr. Turd to you. 
 I love being a MAN!!!  Ain't life great? 
 Joanie found the email from CALP stating they did receive the wire payment. Robin called Roman and gave him the info.  thanks Joanie. 
 This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.  Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.  Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give Mark a copy.  Thanks. 
 Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.  Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 Sched Fee  $20,000.00  I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice. 
 Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.  AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that number. 
 Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.  I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What do you guys think? 
 According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?  thanks 
 Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;  Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000? What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? 
 Seen this one? 
 Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4.  I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.  I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge. 
 Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.  Thanks 
 What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price.  Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.  What do you think?? 
 I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.  I should have February to you by next week some time. 
 Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other.  Thanks 
 Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez?  Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached. 
 Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084. 
 FYI 
 The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.  This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals.  Which brings up the following issues; *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility. Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.  * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?  * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals  I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.  Thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 Could you get Terry authorization to path in Unify please?  Thanks 
 Hey gang.  Joanie is still working on current day activity.  Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447.  I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day. 
 Please reserve a conference room for up to 7 people for 1 hour on Wednesday, April 12th around 2:30pm.  thanks 
 OK.  Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in Unify with a zero volume. 
 Don't I always get back to you within 10 min???? 
 uhhh - ok  <=== see no caps. 
 NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. 
 Chewies on the way!!!! 
 Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though. 
 I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.  The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm.   Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will be attending.  I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending. 
 Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes are on "Sheet 1". 
 I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb.  They have a little comment on their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.  Give me a call once you get these.  cg 
 Hey Sparky!  FYI. 
 Hey gang.  Dan caught my mistake.  Tenn fuels change in April.    March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.17%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9327 
 Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom. 
 This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.  Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.  2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.  Comments/questions? 
 Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever addressed.  Comments? 
 Not bad.  Went to a John Zurita fish fry.  I rode to John's house with a power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle brace and tennis shoes to work.  I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.

 How much is this hot date gonna set me back - $2,000??? 
 Here is the transport data for the Cook School Road   March  April CNG Index $2.79  $3.06  Demand $.1000  $.0400 Comm  $.0521  $.0521 Fuel  1.28%  1.28%  Receipt Price $2.6029  $2.9294  Let me know what you come up with.  Thanks 
 Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone number? 
 I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.  Matt, why don't you go in my place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..  However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller cubes now. 
 We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 dts and the price is $2.22. I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a wholesale transaction. 
 We parked gas (deal 240072) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out (deal 240073) on the 10th.  ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily balance. 
 This is more CNG fuel waiver stuff.  Thanks 
 FYI, Joann scheduled the intra day. 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow moring.  I expect to be in around lunch time.  Thanks 
 Please unsuspend and bill the following Jan CES deals  Deal  Pipe volume  Amount  Comment 145311  ANR 5071  11992.92 we billed the Trunkline piece of this deal. 145317  ANR 37975  89810.88 145319  ANR 16275  38490.38    Still researching the following deals  Deal  Pipe volume  Amount  Comment 149430  ANR 34248  76030.56 sent email to Tom Donoho to research.   I will be in after lunch.  I may try to send you more deals. 
 I would path the April deal just like we did the previous deals, 102122 and 102121. 
 Present this email at a time of MY convenience and receive 1 free $.50 beverage from the 32 floor pop machine!!  Have we got perks or what! :o) 
 There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you did the deal with?  Thanks. 
 oh it is not.  You Lie! 
 Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;  "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".  If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  Let me know if you have any questions.  thanks 
 I've been in you house since then.  I also have a doggie book in the back of my car that belongs to you. 
 C'mon - I want a free lunch.  I could interduce you to a new place, real close to work. 
 You bet.  Don't you think we could send something a little better? 
 I think I might call.  Would you take me our for a free lunch? 
 It looks like I'm missing demand charges on the following CES Transco contracts for January  k# 3.3053 3.3039 3.3109 3.3085 3.3115 2.4899 2.7160 2.8607 
 We received a prior period adjustment (December activity) on the JanuaryTransco invoices for CES.  Its a credit of $6,432.31.  Its releated to the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.  This credit should be passed through to CES.  How is that being handled? 
 As always, they catch me at my most beautiful pose. 
 Thanks. 
 Melissa, am I at liberty to discuss pricing information and to provide my price calculation worksheets (transport capacity and pricing worksheet) with Don Kirkendall? 
 Well, aren't you just full of wisdom! 
 I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.  I'm working fast and furious on March.  I was going to do most of April next week with Molly.  Can I give it to you then?  Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you are ok with that.  Just let me know.  I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins.  I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage.  For now, I will allow the intra day changes. 
 The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over.  Comments/questions? 
 Do we still need to be transporting Bridgeport CNG produciton gas through Coronado to CGAS?  AND if YES, will this gas always need to go through Coronado?  I thought that was just a seasonal thing 
 I think the National Fuel is local production.  I'm don't know how you would swing this volume. 
 I apologize for this.  May I get a copy of all the invoices we sent CES for January please. 
 Hi campers.  Its that time of month again, I need all the transport information for CES for March. 
 I do love chocolate malts though.  i guess that's what us low life forms live on. 
 Brian, I'm Fed Exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the following exceptions:  Transco:  I missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity charges.  I am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and I will be making a billing adjustment this Friday.  I have not review all the invoices I am sending you.  And I have made copies for Don.  I will give him his copies on Friday or Monday.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I've gone through most of the CES stuff for Jan.  I'm missing several demand charge contracts and commodity for CES on Trco.  I think you need to call me. 
 Big Bang??  Are you saying I was born out of the lowest form of life on earth? 
 I'm going through the Jan transport invoices.  I see I need to bill CES for some South Georgia activity.  How did we pay South Georgia, I don't see a matrix in Unify. 
 Actually, cheeseburger and a shake!! 
 I guess you won't be taking me out for a cheeseburger this evening will you ? 
 We can do that.  Brian, would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF invoices for January?  We will take care of everything else.  thanks 
 Hi Anita, my name is Chris Germany and my phone number is 713-853-4743.  My fax number is 713-646-8453.  I believe you and I will be working together. 
 Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday. He is requesting copies of the transport invoices.  Should I give the invoices to him or should I send them to Charlie? 
 I would like to have the following 2 speed dials added to Page 10,  CES DALP 703-561-6469  CES DOUG 703-561-6339   thanks 
 I faxed a copy of the PSNC invoice for March to Brian Perrone.  I show this as a purchase from CES at St 85.  Also, I believe March is the last month CES is taking the gas from CES.  Brian, I'm tossing my copy, let me know if you have questions.  Thanks. 
 Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round  OR  $.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.  The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in. 
 OK this is metered production on CNG.  Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with. The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES production.  After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal in Sitara with a zero volume. 
 If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool). If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production or pool gas on CNG? 
 Hey John, did CES take this gas for Jan, Feb, and Mar?  Wade would like to see this deal in the system. 
 I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April.  Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this. Also, send me your phone number.  I can't find it. 
 Hey dudes, we need someone to attend this.  I'm thinking Scott Goodell should go.  Let's chat. 
 T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.  Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.  CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999. T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.  T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to April 1, 2000.  John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question. 
 This deal has been entered a CNG South Citygate deal and it should be entered and CNG Appalachian production.  Jim Javins said he thought the deal was behind hastings.  Could you guys move it.  I would but Mr. Tengle yelled at me about messing up the risk assignments.

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification. On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines. The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at (304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.  April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00 11:10 am Posted 4/3/00 11:10 am  Dear Pool Operator:  CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in. The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.  Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool.  As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify producers individually.  We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled shut       down will not be until 2002.  If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to contact me at (304) 623-8698.  Sincerely,    Nancy M.

 I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th. Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's.  Thanks 
 Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May. This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to.  Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management group. 
 I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the transport. 
 Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need to address right away.  Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.  Thanks. 
 Hey, you should see us up here.  We are real nice and close.  I was out Friday and we moved from 31 to 32.  The schedulers are up here with us, although we are so far apart, you still need to use the squawk box to chat with 'em. 
 Transco Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed. Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.  Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next Wed.  Tetco We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.  CNG We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around to requesting them.  Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet.  I will be calling in the morining. 
 1.  May Only   $.4300 2.  May/Oct       $.4380 Jun/Oct         $.4400 Just wanted to show the diff between May and the rest of the summer.  Let me know how this looks.    3.  Nov/Mar  no offer 
 Hi Team!  I will be out of the office on Friday, March 31st.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have.  Later 
 Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is $2.40 = $.08.  Everything looks good except the recallable factor.    Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446. I can't get my machine to print out the forms.  Good Luck. 
 Glad to hear things are going well.  talk to you later,. 
 I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached.  I will discuss this with Charlie. 
 FYI 
 thanks 
 We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an "East" desk pipe as oppossed to "Market East".  Please let me know if you think there might be any problems.

 Opps! 
 Hi gang.  I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb.  We will have to look at it next week.  Deal 162283 and 162282.  We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois.  we will chat. 
 You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my capacity. 
 Mr. Monroy entered deal 218918 in Sitara on 3/15/2000 with a Tagg # NC3056. I don't know who this is.  Could you let me know which trader did this deal please.

 Look guys - I suspect these are deal entry problems as opposed to deal valuation problems.  Please take a look.   Should I just enter these deals in Sitara for now (just for April) and let you know what the new deal numbers are? 
 I would like to see the tickets for deals 100093 and 100096.  Thanks 
 Created deal # 231048 to net out against Z6 sales on 527 a day.  Molly 
 I'll be needing a "significant other" for the party.  Do you have any spares? 
 Please review the following discrepancy and let me know what the price should be. 
 Hi Steph.  Are you busy?  Look - work!! 
 I'm there.  I'm out Friday.  Also, Molly will be full time CES starting next week.  Kim, please reserve a room for a conference call for one hour starting at 11:00 am this Thursday. 
 Robin said you are going to be doing some of the Inside Ferc numbers.  I'm out Friday so I'm sending this to you now. 
 I don't remeber, who was taking care of changing the CES counterparties?  Was that someone in Global?

 Hey!!   It worked!  Ankle is ok.   I will start using your stock tips soon. 
 Anytime.  I'll buy you a beverage next time you come down. 
 Hi team.  FYI - I just received the CALP invoice for Feb today in my inbox. I mailed it to Mark just so he could have a non-faxed copy for his files. 
 ID cgerman Pword clg03mar    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have all of you set up in my group profile for CES now. 
 My fault.  I should have sent this out this morning. 
 Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059.  We did this exact setup on several contracts today. 
 All very good questions and NO, we don't have an anwser. 
 Hi team.  I may be inviting you to a chat on Thurs. 
 Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk.   Comments/questions? 
 I executed the Bug capacity for April.  Offer #16219, vol=103,  k#892865, deal numbers 229304/229314  I set it up under MarketEast and East with Market East as primary. 
 i'm all over it. 
 What's the word Mr. Goodell?  I'm thinking there is no demand charge and this acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand. 
 I sure did work hard on this didn't I? 
 You de' Woman!! 
 We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.  ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily balance on the 28th.  This gets confusing because we already have a parking deal from the weekend that comes out in April. 
 Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first? 
 I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other gathering contracts. 
 Hey, I just undid what I did because the deal already exist under ENA - Market East.  Thanks dude! 
 Hi Team!  I just extend CNG deal 116090 through 1/31/2001. 
 Oh it hurts so bad.  Sure wish I had a Diet Coke to take my mind off the intense pain. 
 281-693-7427 
 We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be taking it out during April (deal 225534).  ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt = $1,500.00 in April.  Please let me know if you have questions. 
 Earth day info. 
 Hey Pops!  Here is the deal.  If you can verify that you recieved this message, you can have Jerry's jet ski.   That's right, its FREE!!  Just call me up within 10 days from the receipt of this email and say the word "BULL" and you've got yourself one semi-used jet ski. 
 Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.  I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.  Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct? 
 Them's fightin words!  Ahh my poor ankle.  It's just about time for me to leave I think. 
 I'm thinking about getting a "Hang Glidin" tatto. 
 You know all and see all.  Who can I start sending all these pricing questions to?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Yep.  I'm a wild man now. 
 What do I get if I break the chain? 
 That stuff will just make you fat!  You keep that up and you will never have a slim & trim figure like I do!! 
 Right.  Price for 24th is $2.88 - .005= $2.875 
 I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.  Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas from CES at GD - $.005  Let me know if you have questions. 
 I guess my new address is chris.germany@enron.com 
 Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?  I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in Sitara.  Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara. 
 According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS + .015.  I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001. 
 Yuck!  Some of this looked spooky.  Baseball tickets:  you and your buddy Maureen go to the game on Tuesday, June 6th.  I believe the Astro's play MIN. 
 Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport (at least with the way things work in our systems). 
 I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara (deal 224977) effective 4/1/200 thru 10/31/2000.  Dick, Scott, the sales price is trigger deal priced at  NX1 + $.22. Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the CGAS pool.  My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus (phone 412-394-2953).  David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through Dick's book. 
 This is ok for March. 
 Is Dayton showing the price to be 1.  $2.47 and $2.455  2.  $2.47 +.17 and $2.455 + .17?  To me it looks like options 2.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I need to pull my tapes for Jan 21st.  Would you take care of that please? 
 What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?  The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I entered it in Sitara deal 223022.  Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify. 
 pulled up deal 158501 and added a demand charge for k#66394 
 i added deal 223021, cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara.  what is this capacity for?  its FTS 1 at rate $1.1600 
 Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow but I will call her.  Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next. 
 Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know. 
 That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last day of the month. 
 I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite, Mr. Goodell will be a busy fellow.  I think I visit Tahitti 
 For Jan, the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $200.00    Enron Capital Management 
 I don't think 3rd times a charm.  Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy??? 
 I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.  CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648  I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the worksheet.  Comments/Questions? 
 That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke??? 
 Looks pretty empty so far. 
 Kewel!!! 
 funny.  Oh my poor foot.  Noone cares about me. 
 I always have time for you.  I'm out all day tomorrow. 
 For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.   Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.  1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At today's prices we save:  Savings Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88 ------------ Total Savings $.1151  At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie  2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of $.04 to $.06.   Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer. 
 I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st. Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool (deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.  2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline. 1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.  Price = $2.77 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach .0250  demand charge --------- 2.8995 CGAS price.    Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 9:30 and 10:00 
 It's not in the worksheet. 
 I tried calling you last night but your phone just kept ringing.  AND, John Kinder called me this morning and told me I didn't get my capacity.  He said the winter goes for max rate and I bid $.16, but the goober would not give me a good feel for what it went for. 
 I updated the Transco rates and fuel for April.  It is in the "Offseason Rate" tab in the "2000tran03" file. 
 Done!  What's next? 
 I will assume you de' man on this one. 
 This deal terminates effective 3/31/2000.  FYI - all BUG terminate effective 3/31/200. 
 Hey Buddy, would you change my email address to Chris.Germany@enron.com please.  Thanks 
 Hey Doug, could you change my email address in your system to Chris.Germany@enron.com  thanks 
 I had this filed in the wrong spot.  These are John's citygate production deals. 
 I sold another 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES (Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 221731) . 
 The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of you is it?  I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this. 
 I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices.  Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff.  However, I getting copies as I work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan.  I will make copies an send them to Brian.  Brian, what is your mailing address? 
 I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 6.423 (deal 205687).  I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).  We were billed 6.423 in January.  That's an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50. 
 220903 
 What's your work number?  I'm updating my Lotus Notes Database and I left my day planner at home - too much weight in the backpack. 
 I just set up a new storage contract for Egan Hub Partners.  Deal 205633. 
 Good.  I'll be expecting you. 
 I changed the price on deal 145638.  I show we should make about $19,000.00. Let me know what you see,. 
 Ohh my poor ankle!!  Do you care? 
 Let's try this again.  I now have all the deals.  Today, I took the price to 0 for the following deals 209176 and 209178.  All the other deals do not have any pricing.  I would like to know the economic impact of taking the prices out before Scott see this in the morining report. 
 Nope. 
 Nope. 
 I extended Sitara deal 143323 thru march.  This is a Boston Gas release to CES SS-1 contract.  Should we release this to ENA? 
 I made a mistake the Borrowed deal is 220270 the payback deal is 220254 
 Please set up the following Service Type, Rate Sched combinations.  Pipe Code EGHP Firmness Firm Service Type Storage Rate Sched FSS Term  Term   thanks 
 As you all know I'm handicapped and its not because I'm a agiee.  Borrowed 10,000 dt from CNG Transmission intraday on the 17th, deal 219976. Payback 10,000 dt over the weekend, 18th-20th, deal 219982. ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the ending daily balance.  Please let me know if you have any questions. thanks  3-4743 
 I guess we won't be having dinner for a while, huh? 
 The web site is in the first paragraph.  Have fun! 
 I understand.  I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES.  If we used it to serve CES, I should have called CES to negotiate a price and thats what I don't see in my records. 
 FYI - need an upgrade on the 22nd.  thanks 
 Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.  When you get back, let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes. 
 Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA which is good enough for me.  I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to Sylvia.  Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also, the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way. Let me know if you have questions.  thanks cg 
 I want to make sure Joni sees everyting on CGAS as well. 
 I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several pipelines.  Who should I talk to?  On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and sell the gas to CES on injections.  On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how to do it.  Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage? 
 Would you guys please give the latest CGAS number for CES?  You know, thats where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA, CALP, and Dayton transport.   Thanks 
 Angie, please send any CNG EBB postings pertaining to Appalachian production to John, Jim, Heidi, Scott, Dick and myself.  I don't think Dick knows what email is but send it to him anyway.  Also, when in doubt about the email, send it anyway.  EES probably sends the same thing to John, Jim and Heidi.  thanks   MARQ CAPACITY AVAILABLE                               Received 3/15/00 3:20 pm Posted 3/15/00 3:20 pm    CNG Transmission will accept bids for the following MARQ capacity, which is available for service commencing April 1, 2000.

 My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing. 
 Nope.  Cove Point is a wholesale asset. 
 Nope.  I think Gloria is though.  I know Victor is but he is out the rest of this week. 
 Robin purchased 8500 dts from Con Ed intra day on the 15th.  These are the changes I made in Transit on contract 3.2067  Activity  Prev Volume New Volume 767169  25000  15000  Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 6571 down by 10000 789154  0  1500  Adjusted sale to Con Ed at meter 1183 up by 1500 789274  0  8500  ???

 There is only a small chance that I will attend.  Vic, make sure and/or Angie go. 
 AND you are a good cook and you smell good too! 
 Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61. The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell him.   I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport). 
 And modest too. 
 CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur, or Fri.  Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like to meet with CNG.  I may or may not be here.  Thanks 
 I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace else.  The monthly demand charge is $125,000.00. 
 Attached is the storage schedule for CES.  Scott, according to Colleen, this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track. 
 I got it.  Thanks 
 I spoke with Brian at CES .  He does not show this deal in his records.  I don't show it in my records either. 
 Would you research this please?  Thanks 
 Hey, I'm not going to the party tonight.  My William's ticket is yours. 
 I'm so sorry.  I hope things go well for you. 
 I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775  Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that. 
 Hey - whats this "was" stuff???? 
 Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of invoices at one time? 
 Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000.  My contact, Brian Perrone, said he has not seen them. 
 Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files "febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to CES for the month of Feb.  The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual process.  I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.  Thanks. 
 Kim is taking care of that invoice.  Thanks 
 Is your Gain ID "ONX1666"? 
 Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok. 
 How did it go? 
 I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below.  Please call me when you get a chance.  Thanks 
 Nope.  It probably should.  It would also be flashed as a reimbursement. 
 1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.  2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those 3 people.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file. I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with you later today.    Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet. 
 I think we are good to go. 
 Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.  I just entered a volume for the last day of the month.  You don't need to do this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th. Then retrack and balance.  Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.  You should be able to apply the payments to these deals. 
 Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production? 
 Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be somewhere around $16.00. 
 Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this. 
 Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day. Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having. 
 CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.  The request was made by Kim Novesak??  I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.  Thanks 
 I will not be attending. 
 DON'T GIVE IN UNLESS YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT!!  Good luck! 
 Go get 'em Tiger. 
 You D' MAN!! 
 Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each month.  True?   March 10, 2000   SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE  NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:   In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.  If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April.  If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041.  Thank you.   Janice Bailey Manager Transportation Services Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

 I believe Beverly uses this to get the gas from Nat Fuel to Transco.

 Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY" 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".  That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!  What's up with you girl? 
 Same thing on k#65403 And k#65534 - I left this one in red. 
 Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to Sitara. 
 Looks good.   Stephanie Sever   03/08/2000 05:35 PM 
 Hey! 
 Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti.  His phone number is 713-853-6320.  I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek numbers (with Scott Goodell as my backup).  I will forward the bid week numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers. After bidweek, you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and myself for all East Desk issues.  Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

 Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.  For CNG, I would prefer to have the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.  Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are starting April? 
 Opps.  Wrong worksheet 
 This is what I have.  Good luck. 
 How does this deal work - deal 165385? 
 Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path those deals and email Mark when you are done.  Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000. 
 Personally, I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17" wheels.  To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool. 
 Did you get the PSNC invoice?  Can I throw mine away now? 
 I have mixed comments on Dodge's.  I think either of the other vehicles are perfect. 
 Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis? 
 I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot was facing North East.  I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".   He popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.  I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.  What are you looking for in a truck? 
 Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings, Bridgeport ...) 
 Not for me,  I'm injured - I dislocated my ankle on Sunday. 
 Who wuz receiving the bills on contracts 2.6598 and 2.6592 in December?  Wuz it CES or Union Camp?  Thank U 
 Hi.  I will not be able to attend because I'm dislocated my ankle and I'm crutchin it now. 
 I luv trucks.  I was injured on Sunday,  I use crutches now. 
 This is just about my intelluctual speed.    Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. You move like the bass which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'.  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, We two go together like a skunk goes with stank.  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth.  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you.  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

 Just a note.  Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St 85 or the PSNC transport.  This is a new contract each month - we are currently shipping 145 dt's. 
 Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand.  AGL released CES some ESR (offer #18307) and WSR (offer #18210).  The demand portion of these contracts being billed on k#1.3473.  What's up. 
 Just to keep you in the loop.  I have not responed to any of these questions yet. 
 Hey Team!  Ms.  "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now.  Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues.  She will be the one setting this up in Sitara in the future.  Thanks.

 Scott misspelled your name.  I hope I have the right guy.  I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.  Thanks cg 
 I wish I could write such sweet words.  There are starting to be way to many Driscoll's, I think there was a Mark and Mike that I came close to sending this to.    Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. You move like the bass which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'.  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, We two go together like a skunk goes with stank.  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth.  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you.  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor! 
 You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.  1.  Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail. The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.  2.  Contract 3.3509 - ???  I don't understand this one.  Take a look at k#1.3473.  Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand estimated in Sitara?  I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.  Let me know what you find. 
 I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract. We have so many.  Do you have a Sitara deal number? 
 Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.   Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing scenarios." 
 Bryan, it doesn't line up very well but this shows that we received 150 dth at St 85 and delivered 145 to PSNC.   03/01/00                                TRANSCONTINENTAL GAS PIPE LINE CORPORATION                             REPORT NO.: GCS1060B 13:40:11                       DAILY BILLABLE PARTY TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULE QUANTITY REPORT                              PAGE:   16 ALL QUANTITIES IN DTS BILLABLE PARTY:   7973  ENRON NORTH                  GAS DAY: 03/01/00  TIMELY CYCLE     EVENING CYCLE      ID1 CYCLE        ID2 CYCLE  ---------------  ---------------  ---------------  --------------- CNTR NO.

 Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only.  Match deal 211356 with 211359.  thanks 
 I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES (Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 210987).  Who schedules this gas? 
 She's still a porker as of this morning. 
 Joe, it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity.  I'm not touching until you and I chat.  I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon. 
 I'm going to change the sell to CES on Monday for now.  I will chat with my CES counterpart this afternoon about how to treat this. 
 Done.  Deal 210603  I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her voodoo stuff, this deal will show up.  Ms.  Franklin, this might be my last contract to set up (he he he <=== evil snicker!). 
 Do you think Scott should go to this?? 
 I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.  CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.   Comments? 
 Call me if you have questions. 
 Uhhh- you bet! 
 M, these deals should show up in Unify by lunchtime today.  Sherry, you guys should see this after lunch.  Thanks. 
 Meredith, please path deal 209359 with 209371 for Jan 31.  This should capture the meter bounce fee ENA owes Bay State.  Sherry, I don't remember who gave me this invoice.  I will leave it on your desk. 
 nuthing but retail stuff.  Why would anyone do retail stuff?

 Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting.  Example #1  Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of PECO in Z6. What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;  PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?  PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to Z6?   Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.  Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

Subject to the open-access requirements of Parts 161 and 284 of the Commission's regulations, unless mutually agreed otherwise in consideration of relevant operational and market factors, CNG reserves the right to reject any bids at less than its maximum applicable rates.  CNG also reserves the right to reject contingent bids and bids from any party that does not qualify for service in accordance with all applicable provisions of CNG's FERC Gas Tariff.  Bids for this capacity must be submitted to CNG by fax at (304) 623-8530, during the period from 10:00 AM (EST) February 29, 2000, through 10:00 AM (EST) on March 1, 2000.

 February 29, 2000                                       Received 2/29/00 11:30 am Posted 2/29/00  11:30 am  Dear Producers and Shippers,  In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed. Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:  1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,  2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.  We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you. If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.   Sincerely,   H. Dale Rexrode Director, Producer Services and Business Development 
 I love Chic Fe Le. 
 Good news, even better when it happens.  My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.  They still need to reconstruct January.  Billing I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES. I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.  I want to fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the scheduling fee. The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th. 
 Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport. Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.  Also, yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB.

 Did you get you Boston Gas setup taken care of? 
 FYI if you guys are interested. 
 It appears that the volume on the sale to CES-Woodward Marketing is 4000/day for March.  Tammi called Woodward to verify. 
 Please create a new CPR index report and have it sort 1st byPub Code, 2 nd by pipe, 3rd by zone.    Also, please subtotal by Pub Code. 
 We need to add Sonat to our CES retail demand charge sheet.  Let's chat.

 Let's see, got a freebie at the Blue Agave last night (Mexican food), they fed us Curmley's (crossaint sandwiches and tortilla soup) yesterday, breakfast yesterday and today and tomorrow and Monday.  I wonder what's for lunch tomorrow?  And I wonder why I have such a hard time loosing weight. 
 My techy's going to help me buy a computer.  I'm thinking of buying a Dell Pent III 600 Mhz with a bunch of other stuff I know nothing about and an HP8?? color printer.  I was also going to buy a digital camera and start taking a lot more family photo's and save them to disk.  What do you think?  I was also going to try and create a home page and keep track of the stuff I plan on doing.  1st up is Hang Gliding the first weekend in March.  I have not registered yet.  Cool huh?

 Nonono.  That profile is for Natasha - not me. 
 Hey.  It's international  friend week.  I'm sending Natasha an international friend email.  I'll send you the email that I send her.  Here is the profile I have built for her: 29 yr old, Teaches a children's Sunday School class, excellent piano player, believes in recycling, helps little old ladies across the street, loves arts and crafts shows, and bakes cookies!  What do you think.  What's your wife's name?  I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email. 
 Hey!  Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi?  Are you going to work for Enron?  We get discounted deal tickets to Astroworld every April - you don't want to miss that!! 
 CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the month CGAS price.  Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth of deal 159319.  We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on the 24th.  I will let you know if things change. 
 You go girl! 
 Always a pleasure  :o) 
 I didn't have this email when I left yesterday. 
 I knew we would have to address this eventually.  CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into CGAS at Lebanon.  This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer. 
 I sold 7000 to CES at the Allied meter for tomorrow - deal 169576.  Joann, let the Tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at Broad Run. 
 I just created "2000bug03.xls" and "2000tran03.xls".  Joe, we will continue to use the CES Wholesale tab in the 2000tran03 worksheet. 
 My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January.  Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.  We probably will not be able to cover everything at once.  We still have a few items to bill.  I will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them. 
 Does any of this impact the Central Desk? 
 FYI, not the markets I was hoping to see. 
 GET OUT!  No Way?  I think I'll change something in the system. 
 I think its just the demand charge.  Algon only has 2 firm commodities that we have worked with and both are fairly cheap.  Most of the Algon expense is in the demand charge. 
 I included this on my worksheet.  Here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend.  Pager  800-978-1788  does not work at my Dad's house.

 I just sent you and email.  Feel free to mention my name to Ishi.  More names later today! 
 Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.  I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700). Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not make them an offer.  Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.  But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat with.  I get you more scoop later. 
 Bay States will be sending us an invoice for an Algonquin meter bounce fee. I would like to see when it gets here.  It's not in the system, but Meredith and I will take care of after I get the invoice.  Please call me if any of you come accross it.  thanks cg 3-4743 
 When you get a chance would you redraft the CES invoice and call me?  Thanks 3-4743 
 I promise to be a perfect gentleman (or as perfect as an Aggie can be).

 You're probably gone anyway.  I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".   Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."  The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars."  Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word.  They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars." 
 Jim asked me to forward this to you.  We should probably discuss this.

 Brian with CES just called me and asked if we could take the cut at Colonial?  Let me know. 
 We bought 8000 (deal 160324) and sold it to CES in CPA 4-25 (deal 160327) for the 2nd. 
 My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd.  Brian, do we need to do anything for the 1st? 
 Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  Please let me know how you sourced the gas. 
 Opps - for gas flow day 2/1/2000. 
 Per my discussion with Joann, it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at meter 80-03 on CGAS. 
 CES was cut 7314 at WGL on CGAS for the 1st.  I sold CES the gas on TRCO for the 1st and the 2nd (deal 159474). 
 Reminder 
 I just updated the transport rate and corrected some of the points. 
 I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor.  The price is $3.06.  Could you get me the meter numbers?  This is what I have so far  COH Mrkt Area Monthly Vol Meter 7 5  700 7 1  1141 7 1  682 7 5  1993 7 5  2881 8 5  5534 9 5  12309 5 2  1577 
 I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you.  Do you have any comments to add?  I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and ask them how they would like for me to handle this.   Do not share any of this with CES.  Thanks. 
 Hi team.  Guess what day it is??!! 
 I just sold CES 8980 day for 1st and 2nd at the CGAS pool for International Paper - deal 159101. 
 We still have CGLF and CGAS contracts showing up as CES and Columbia Market in Navigator.  Scott and I will look at contracts 42789, 63115, and 66278. Please let Scott know if you need any of the remaining contracts moved over to ENRON N A.  Thanks.

 How about we move it to ENA. 
 Has CES global contract  96030669 / 65071 been transferred from CES to ENA? 
 We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal (deal 158112) and sold to EES (deal 158120) for the 29th-31st.  This gas is coming from Allied Signal.  Lee Tippet thought the contract number was 62672.  Joany, would you verify that, thanks. 
 Just wanted to make sure you received this. 
 We have a 2500 dt/day supply from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  This deal is matched with a term sale to FirstEnergy (deal 145648 for Jan and deal 157848 for Feb and Mar).  This is a John Singer deal.  I have no idea what the price is on the sale to FirstEnergy. 
 This is ok.  I sold them 767 for the 27th and 28th.  I told Bryan to make sure he doesn't need the 767 for the 29th - 31st. 
 I just created a deal for TRCO contract 3.3433 (deal 157600).  This is the master contract for all ENA deals on rate schedule FTSR.  We will be doing nominations under this contract. 
 I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost for January, even if we did not get set up as agent, correct? 
 I replaced deal 155238 with 157242 and I fixed the metered volumes for the last day on deal 155244. 
 Bought from CPA (deal 157219) sold to CES (deal 157220) for the 29th-31st.

 I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America now has 3 storage contracts. 
 I hear we are staying at 68 for tomorrow at O&R. 
 where are you? 
 Thanks. 
 Hey!!  Where are you?  I'm about to go get my Dad a chocolate malt.  Today is his long day at the hospital.  He's probably still there. 
 How about Monday, Jan 31st for dinner??

 I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger?? 
 Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down. 
 We bought 4385 from CPA (deal 155237) and sold it to CES (deal 155238).  We bought 1249 from CPA (deal 155240) and sold it to EES (deal 155244).  Do the emails help??  Is this the way you guys want ot see this? 
 We bought 500 from COH (deal 155197) and sold it to CES (deal 155195) for the 26th.  This deal was done without Brian's approval.  He seemed mildly annoyed but I think he will forget about it. 
 We sold Cove Point gas to CES, the volume is 228 dth - deal 155139. 
 I'm forgot, what do you need at Tenn O&R for tomorrow? 
 We will deliver 46 dth to Tenn NYSEG meter 020221on contract 31533 at first of the month prices.  Also, we are selingl you the 600 dth of CNG delivered at $5.00 for the rest of the month.

 Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV. 
 This looks like IT stuff to me. 
 Should this deal be extended? 
 I think we chatted about this the other day.  I'm waiting to see if we actually get the retail deal before I send any notification.  Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb.  I wouldn't tell Steve its not a done deal yet.  Just tell him we are still working things out. 
 You must have put a lot of thought in this.  P 
 Would you send me an amtel at 3:00pm Wed, Jan 26 about my review?  Thanks 
 What did we do about this?  I'm thinking we let it flow. 
 I bet you think I have been ignoring you, right?  Does this mean I don't have to read all those emails you sent me? 
 Kim, please send Victor and myself an amtel message at 11:00am AND at 1:30pm on Feb 1 to attend the meeting below.  Please include the room and time on the amtel.  I think it will be a busy day.  Thanks 
 We should chat about CALP and Dayton Power & Light. Victor, should we invite Joany? 
 Do you mean an ENA sale to Keyspan? 
 Deal 150348.  I have it in Sitara as  833 day for the 15th-31st.  This deal is secondary recallable, which means the gas don't flow if secondary transport gets cut. 
 I'm at work, where are you?? 
 I made a couple of changes.  This worksheet will be your top priority for Friday. 
 Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for that?  The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.  I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this worksheet tomorrow.

 Please check on the actual storage capacity volume on FSS contract 63304. I'm showing 7,503,838 dth and I'm thinking it might be closer to 7,000,000.  Thanks 
 I forgot about this deal. 
 Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails.  Here is what your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct. 
 Sorry it took so long.  I believe this was the last email I sent out. 
 This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, please let me know if this is incorrect.  ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.  Comments/questions?  Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara. 
 Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch.  Supply Deal Market Deal 153071  153057 153096  153135 153109  153109  The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES.  Originally these deals were done for the 21st, I just extended the date and the volumes through the 24th.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 My good buddy Scott set up contract .9047 in Sitara.  Please note:  do  not schedule gas on this contract.  This contract was set up for accounting purposes only. 
 I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco.  I'm assuming you and Ms. Jordan are taking care of everthing on that.  Also, if you ever need to send transport contracts to Houston, its best to send it to Sylvia Campos. She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper.  So send her allllll of your paper.

 I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS. 
 Not yet.  However, the contract is valid because Vickie is using it. 
 deals 136749 & 149838  Thanks Buddy 
 Done - take a look. 
 I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans? Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me). Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.  Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.  Thanks 
 The Equitrans capacity deals exist!! 
 I just created deal 149901, an Equitrans, capacity deal.  I populated all the fields because Sylvia Campos had created the information prior to my creating the deal.  After I released the deal, the pipeline contract and agency contract disappearred. 
 No replying this late at night.  Then I don't have an excuse for not doing my job. 
 Email works good.  Do you know which deal I should put that on? 
 This is in Sitara. 
 We know about this don't we Judith!!!

 Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF +.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.  The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

 I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.  Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.  As far as I can tell, ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues. 
 I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES Retail fuel management deal.  ENA has the right to use the capacity and does all the nominations on the CALP contract.  I still need the counterpart set up.  Thanks  Victor,  for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 149776).  We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and unconstrained citygates.  Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.  For January, we will treat this as an exchange.  We need to chat about Feb and March.

 -   Why Exercise???  1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is.  2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again.  3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks. Haven't lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.  4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing.  5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body.  6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.  7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.  8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.  9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.  10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of my glass.

 CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete.  Here are my questions/comments;  1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange. I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC. If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.  2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due.  3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?  4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who should he talk to about that??   Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.  Thanks 
 Please reserve a conference room for the people listed above at 3:00 PM, tomorrow.  Mr. Javins will be present via conference call.  thanks

 CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to FirstEnergy.  Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day. I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.  Comments? 
 What type of IT contract is CES contract #.6187??  The contract description in Transit is Case-Pomeroy & Company, Inc.  Hmmm? 
 I need a new pipeline set up.  CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.  All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.  Name:   Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership Internet Address: http://www.latec.com/covepointlng/ Curve:   Tetco M3   This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on CGAS.  We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st.   Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?  Please let me know what I need to do. 
 Hows your day 
 Done again. 
 I agree, you stay home.  He didn't have any info on the test. He was ready to go., 
 Beavy??  I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up.  I know I need to set up IT contracts in Sitara.  And I think the agencies with other counterparties is at the bottom of the pile.  Comments 
 Pop's just called me.  He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying in the Hotel.  He is going home now, and will drive back tomorrow for the test results. 
 I'm sorry.  I forgot to mention Kathy and I can't find these deals in our system. 
 Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.  1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.  2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.  Do you know anything about these deals? 
 Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format? We may not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).  What do you think? 
 Which pipe? 
 You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is cushy?????? 
 You are wonderful!! 
 Is the TCO capacity from Eagle Point considered Retail or Wholesale? 
 Done, I think. 
 CNG SAbine contact is Alain Diza 713-752-7690. 
 Final Final numbers?? 
 Victor verified that the TCO storage is at 0.  He entered a volume of 1DT and the deal number is 143337. 
 How much of this capacity do we have for the first? 
 The 2000ces01.xls is the file I created.  The other file was created by Jeff Hodge 
 Dad is at Howard Johnson at 9604 S Main, room 403, phone 713-666-1411 
 Hey team, I entered a sale of 10,659 in M3 for the 1st (deal 144104).  This does not include anything that has PECO-PA gas.  Morgan and/or Phil have to help me figure out what that is. 
 I'm thinking about seeing them tomorrow - lettin' em chill.  I'm going to try to make the Thursday 4:00PM appointment. 
 I don't understand the PA gas for Peco comments.  Can you guys clear this up for me? 
 I don't think there are any Central Desk changes. 
 Robert, please check on this with the TCO schedulers and let me know what you find out.  Thanks 
 Please discuss this with Morgan.  I didn't know CGV had a delivery point off Transco. 
 Colleen will be attending via conference call. 
 David, I like to be include on the emails but I believe this will come from your people.  Let me know if I need to do something. 
 Please set up a meeting for this afternoon and invite the following people. Bob Superty Kathy Kelly Ed Terry Tricia Bowen Judy Townsend Dan Junek Chris Germany Victor Lamadrid Molly Johnson Randy Gay George Smith Maria Garza Mark Friedman Ami Chokshi Scott Mills Dave Nommenson David Scott - with CES  Hopefully this will be a quick meeting. 
 Here 
 Why don't you guys try Pappa's Steakhouse?  It's about $20 - $30 a plate. 
 Sorry if this is a duplicate - I don't remember if I sent this to you. 
 What pipe is this off of or is it split up between several?? 
 Did you guys execute the PSNC contract?? And if so - as CES or CEM??  Also, I'd like to have the offer number.  I think Transco is done except for PSNC.  Transco Stuff I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES. I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.  I think thats it. 
 I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara  We have; several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES, we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S. Jersey - on CEM  I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my priority list right now.  I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - this has not been done yet.  Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation.  ta da  :) 
 Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278. Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.  Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.  Thanks 
 Tuesday 12/28/99 9:00am   Aspiration biopsy with specimen collection hematology.  Wed 12/29/99 7:00 am  CT scan without oral preparation 10:00am Bone scan dosage 12:00pm Bone scan examination  Thur 12/30/99  4:00 pm  appointment with Dr. Lee Jin Soo  There you go. 
 FYI - I believe this is important.  According to Morgan (CES's CNG scheduler) CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity.  I've had 3 people call me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000. 
 According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR. Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.  You may already know about this deal.  Morgan handles all the nominations at East Ohio.  Hunter, someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal.  Thanks 
 How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was dedicated to retail?  From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small. 
 Setting these up in Sitara will be part of my night job.  I must have peace and quiet to focus on Transco. 
 This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM.  For most pipelines, It does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another counterparty.  Call if you have questions. 
 Deja Vu!  I'm waiting for those Final Final Revised Final numbers!! 
 Attached is the master list of contracts.  I save this file as o:/common/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/hodge 12 23 1999.xls.  I know you have an abundance of time on your hands so feel free to browse this tiny little worksheet.  Call me if you have questions. 
 I don't think I have sent this to  you yet.  There are some ANR volumes down below. 
 I think that's enough stuff for now. 
 Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.  Transport I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.  Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Good question.  Good Luck  Have fun ;) 
 I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage (see items in BLUE below).  According to John, CES was not able to utilize the PEPL storage volumes. Hunter, someone on your desk needs to speak with Marke Breese and John Hodge about the Dayton Storage. 
 Linda, Sylvia,  I need you to set up the Transco contracts as outlined below.

 I believe the EOG volumes listed below are ANR citygate deliveries.  Hunter, Dan and I will be entering all the physical retail volumes in Sitara for the East Desk.  Let me know who you want us to give this information to on the Central Desk. 
 Hey John, its a 30 min. trip for the email - go figure. 
 Where have you been??  Why havn't you called?? 
 I know you are going to make me a happy camper and let me know what you have executed for Jan 2000 so far!! 
 FYI 
 I have 2 storage questions for now.  1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking facility. The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?   2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current storage balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??       thanks 
 I have not looked at this file yet.  Please pass it on to whomever you think might need it. 
 I have updated the Tetco 7c usage tickets to include fuel. 
 Ernie's on the team now. 
 Very funny! 
 I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email. 
 I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form.  Jerry, please forward to Don, I couldn't email him the other day. 
 Hey team, I know you guys are concerned about my welfare so I'm taking vacation.  I will be off on Tuesday Oct 17th and the week of Nov 13th-17th. 
 I took a 1/2 day of vacation yesterday, the 5th. 
 Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale? I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct? 
 I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.  Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man? 
 U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just kicked in somehow. 
 She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.  I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck. 
 Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.  Comments, questions? 
 Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines? 
 The truth is out there! --  ------- Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day    Computer Gender  An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names, and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she." One of the students raised her hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups:  males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.  The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.  The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.  3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. 
 I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy  :) 
 Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380. 
 According to somebody - housecats left outside kill over 1,000,000 tweety birds a day! 
 Hey there.  I was on vacation on the 9th.  I guess its ok to send out the invoice now. 
 I was going to call and harasses you but no one answered your phone.  I'm pretty sure my purpose on life is to make you miserable.  What do you think?  I will be out of the office this afternoon after 2:00 pm - Tenn shipper meeting. 
 Done

 I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this deal ticket.  Let me know if there are any problems.  This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New Power. 
 I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.  This is a bookout.  The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't then I goofed. 
 We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose. 
 My fault.  Try it again.  I just released the deal. 
 I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to $1,194,758.  This is on deal 508891.  Would you please send out an adjustment for the decrease to New Power?  Thanks  My fault for not correcting it sooner. 
 You de MAN 
 Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?  I am still estimating about $5,000 per month. 
 I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.  As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and liability) relationships.  Comments/questions?? 
 NEWS FLASH!!!!  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem. 
 Do we still have any activity or imbalances on the following Columbia Energy Services contracts  k# 8G0a61 8g0a62 8g0a63 8g1064 8t0a61 8t0a62 8t1063 8t1064 
 Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of November.  The invoices are on their way, I think it would be easier to sort and review the data in excel.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.  VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec. 
 Date correction, Dec 14, not Nov 14. 
 We a conference room big enough for 8 people on Thursday, Nov 14 at 3:00 PM.  Vickie, I will see if the meeting date can be changed if Dan calls. 
 Looks good with the following changes.  If you see these changes come through then its good to go.  Thanks   The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in Sitara. Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891. Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571. 
 Would you send me the purchases?  thanks 
 Did you say you were missing a phone?  I may have an extra one for sale - CHEAP TOO!  I made a bunch of 1-900 calls on it last night.  Newphew called me at 12:00 ish and showed up around 12:45.  I'm tuckered. 
 That means you didn't send me the attachment. OR if you did, I don't see it. 
 OPPS 
 TP #6562, North Carolina Nat Gas,  is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville.  This point is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. The meter number for Public Serv. NC is TP #6608, and this is also a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool. 
 I need a Destin class.  The only think I know about Destin is that its a Transco Z4 Mainline Point. 
 I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.    I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 4/1/2001.  Pros Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing guru like myself. Will learn a great deal about transport pricing. May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con) Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&L.    Cons Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be. May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions. I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer. I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm very detail oriented. I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the job very serious. 
 I must have deleted the GRI memo I had.  Sorry about that. 
 I need to hold the New Power invoice until Monday.  It should be ready to send out Monday afternoon and everything should be captured in Sitara. 
 Have fun.  Gas prices are going through the roof 
 I will be updating deals 523459 and 523444.  This is a bookout.  I have these deals updated through the 5th

 We have a new backhual contract from Transco.  Term  12/8/2000 - 12/31/2000 Demand $.07 k#  3.7714 Volume  5,000 Rec  Zone 6 Del  Zone 1   I just set this up in Sitara.  Please try to set up an activity number on this contract this afternoon.  Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.  We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle. 
 What happened to all my emails?  How's my Duff?  What's going on? 
 You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you come back. 
 Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production? According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to the bill.  He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might have been some Michcon activity missing. 
 IT'S BIDWEEK.  I'M NOT GONNA SURVIVE.  I WUZ THINKING "RETIREMENT SOUNDS REAL GOOD!" 
 Early morning, right?  I want to be rested for the big party. 
 Hey Team!  This email is just an FYI for you guys.  I don't expect you to see anything until January. 
 Why did you go to power?  Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I made back in 1994?? 
 This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.  Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco mainline.  What do you think?  I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to Transco.  It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St 65. 
 Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid ENA for October activity? 
 Hi.  I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.  Should I let someone in your office know about that? 
 Probably.

 I just faxed the inventory list to Jerry.  Don, do you have a fax number I could send it too? 
 There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 310,000  for Dec 310,000 for Jan 280,000 for Feb  Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge. There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?  Thanks chris 
 I'm going to a Unitariean church on Sunday.  Not happy about it either. 
 Oh be still my aching heart, filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)  I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!! 
 I'll be winning the lotto soon.  Nice knowin ya! 
 Sorry about that.  Gotta go to a meeting.  Give Muffy a hug for me. 
 I love my sweats.  Hows muffy? 
 I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.  Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with Ogy unless she is out.  But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry misstakes I make.  I humbly accept my position. 
 Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 (in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle. E Town N Jersey PSE&G Con Ed Lilco Bug Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco) Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)  Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.  Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.  Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of Lambertiville. 
 ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.  Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I believe its in the deal correctly.  Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or something real intelligent like that.  This deal goes thru 2/28/01. 
 The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.  I created the deal with 0 volumes. 
 Ms.  Arnold called looking for the IF today.  She gets a much better response out of me than you do. 
 Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff??  What numbers should I be using now, FOM number, Volume sold back at Index Flat? 
 We don't have a time frame and I have told her we need to sell the cows and the tractor. 
 I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..  I though you might be asleep. 
 What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today? 
 My worked.  How many times a week did you put down? 
 I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.  Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.  thanks 
 I'm having trouble getting off.  What time is the flight out on the 29th - that's my trouble day, the latter the better so I can be here in the morining. 
 According to Kimat this is flash to actual stuff now.  I made these adjustments today for Nov 30th.  Joann, Alvin, the deals listed below are bookouts. 
 We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.  The deal number is 418282.  Could we put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet? We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.  We need to call Bay State if we move it.   My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.  I gave Stacey Angie's number as a contact.  If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to Robin. 
 I won't be here tomorrow but I found an error on the New Power deals I entered yesterday.

 The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.  Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually flow into CNG.,    Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%. 
 We should have 4682 of Egan coming into TGT for the 1st and 4679 fo the 2nd -31st.  Would you guys check that please.  thanks cg 
 I'm going to Jay Blaine's taylor at 6:30 PM, maybe after. 
 I released 2,000 dth from CGAS contract 62164 to Ashland Inc. effective 12/1/2000 - 12/31/2000. 
 Who knows??? 
 You are the best.  I owe you a popcorn, small. 
 We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th (deal 508572) and taking it out rateably in January (deal 508582).  ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume parked.  These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.  Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).  Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you have questions.  Thanks 
 Jim's a wuss! 
 I set up the following new TU deals for May 1  759849	St 30 to Z6 New York 759876	St 45 to Z6 New York 759877	St 65 to Z6 New York 760097 Ragley to Z6 New York  759992 St 45 to St 65 
 Take a look at the "Spot Deals" tab in this worksheet and let me know if I'm missing anything.  My comments are on row 5.  Everything else on this sheet is a work in progress. 
 According to Mr. Goodell, Tetco has Teal Lodge on the seller's block.  I think you should buy it. 
 Robin called NYPA.  The transport contract has been amended and the only 2 receipt points on the contract are Mamou and Henry.  Bummer. 
 Guudyear 
 Judy said that because I'm so busy, you probably shouldn't bother me with this doyal stuff.  She wants to handle that.  I luv her!! 
 I'm busy washing my hair. 
 Could I get the following people added as contacts for The New Power Company  Tim Ray Jeffery Porter David Scott Mike Garred   You are wonderfull. 
 I might be able to get to it tomorrow if its a slow bid week, if not, then by Wed of next week. 
 CGLF I created deal 530445 (purchase from New Power at CGLF + $.06) to bookout with deal 380571.  CGAS I created deal 503451 (sale to New Power  at CGLF + $.06 + Variable from CGLF M/L to Leach).  Volume = 1,278 Deal 380492 is a sale to New Power, price = NX1 + .28, Volume = 2,683 day Please bookout the 2 sale deals with deal 503453 (purchase from New Power at CGAS IF + $.0125).  Volume = 3,961 day.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Chris 
 Dad has a subscription to Progressive Farmer, would you like me to have that sent to you? 
 I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing. 
 I thought i heard Goodell refer to you as a "GOOBER"! 
 The date of this notice is the 20th, but if you look at the bottom (in bold) it shows this memo was posted today.     Media Inquiries: Chris Stockton (713) 215-2010 Other Inquiries: John McGrath 713-215-2514 November 20, 2000 
 FYI before I delete this email. 
 I think this is correct.  We will show it this way for now.  Can you verify what were billed in demand for Oct please.  No rush., 
 I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of. 
 Please add the following person.  Victoria Versen   happy Turkey day. 
 Would you get me all the contract details on this capacity and email it to me?  thanks 
 Man what a busy day.  I guess Ingrid is ok.  I have not spoke to her for awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think.  I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day, then going to my Dad's place this weekend.  What are you doing? 
 I know you don't believe this but I am working on a notional offer. 
 I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.  I entered this as a Dec-00 deal.  The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.  My fault.  I corrected Sitara. 
 I missed this.  Looks like IT will not flow through St 90 
 I don't have any of the contract information.  I will have to get the info, get Marlene to set these up in global contracts and then set them up in unify.  It probably won't happen today.  I'll keep you posted. 
 I believe this works.  I'm entering all sales to New Power at Broad Run on deal 498019.  I created a purchase deal 498022 priced at FOM Index price.  We should bookout these two deals.  The delivery to the citygate should be on the big FOM deal ticket comingled with everything else. 
 Use Audrey as your contact now.  Her number is 713-853-4317. 
 I went home with every intention of coming back last nite!!  So what if I didn't! 
 We drinking beer tonight?  You called me to late yesterday. 
 I don't know if this meeting is still on.  I'll let you know.

 Sorry Emily.  I usually just type "ALLW" to get Robert. 
 I deleted 2 meters from deal 418282 for 12/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Please make sure the risk assignment is still ok.  Thanks 
 I can't remember, should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and Market East? 
 Hey buddy.  Please allocate the followin deals to 0 for the 9th only.  My mistake and I will owe you for life.  deal 720977, 720959, and 720986

 Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.  I spot checked some of the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next week.  The dollar impact should be very small.  Remember, I'm out next week. 
 Alfonso, you are off the hook. 
 Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.  Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.  I'll explain it to you when I get back.  On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price on the big citygate deal. 
 I just created deals 480324 and 480325 on CGAS for Oct 31st.  I missed these.  Please path them in Unify.  Thanks 
 Your camera takes good photo's.  We are going to the timeshare at Canyon Lake.  Remember, they had the pig and it sleep with Chad and Chance.  We are trailering the motorcycles up there and we are going to take day trips around that area from the time share.  We have the timeshare Mon-Thur or Fri.  Then we are going to Dad's for a night or two. 
 National Fuel Gas Supply is having a Customer Information and Procedures Meeting on Thursday, Dec 7th, at the Marriott West Loop by the Galleria.  The meeting starts at 9:00 am and will probably last to mid-afternoon.  I'm going.  I don't know if anyone else needs to go - Algonso maybe. 
 Thanks for the post card. 
 Hey, you're back.  Did you have fun?  jerry and I are taking a motorcycle trip next week. 
 What Chics will be there -  and you don't count. 
 I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec.  I think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault. 
 I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well. I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?  We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know. 
 Nov 1st.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index pricing.  Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate sale to you, also at the FOM price.  Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and enter the deals.  Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to incorporate it into my citygate pricing. 
 Don't worry about getting me a Diet Coke.  I just got one. 
 My Tetco schedulers have not gotten back to me on whether we have shipped gas on these contracts.  I'll try to check that myself today. 
 Please transfer the storage balance of 420 dth from contract 530750 to VNG contract 300008.  Thanks 
 I know it, you know it, who's telling all the single women?? 
 Commodity and fuel should be 0 going back into Texas Gas.  thanks cg 
 Look again and let me know.  I had problems seeing the volumes at first, THEN I opend my eyes.  Makes a world of difference! 
 I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the following deals. Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.  Deal  Comment 473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections 473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.  Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan to Texas Gas ticket.  All of my information is on the following worksheet 0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested. 
 I did vote for the new sports arena.  AND, I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today.  I will wait till after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input. 
 Use "Sheet 3" on the attached file.  Page me at 1-800-978-1788 if you have questions. 
 Have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?   Deal  contract 456640  894232 456762  894233 459025  894199 459064  894244 459070  894245 459216  894199 
 Great, exactly what I needed. 
 Pager number 877-498-5497 Cell number   713-557-1572  I will be in Port Aranasas Friday morning.  I should be back in Houston by 2:00 PM and I will have my cell phone turned on for the trip home.  I don't have voicemail on my cell phone.  But, if anything should happen, you could leave me a voicemail at home and I will check it once every hour after 1:00 PM on Friday.

I will be coming back Friday with lots of fish!!!!!!!! 
 I can't see what you have in the 5th column.  Buy, if the all meters on the pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know. 
 Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following deal tickets  Deal  Comment 470563  New Power Exchange buy 470568  New Power Exchange sell 470582  CPR Storage Sell 470587  CPR Storage Buy  We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st. Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions. 
 We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.  Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone know the deal tickets by the end of the day. 
 I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know when you validate these or what else you need.  Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF. 
 I added the pipelines and zone/point combonations that I feel we will be using most on EOL.   Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get this via capacity release.  I'm here for you - NOT.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563  Buy exchange 470582  Sell Cpr Storage  470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange   I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through March 31.  I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

 Let's chat about CNG retail storage on Monday 
 Have I told you how wonderful you are?  I actually the Gas Daily prices for every day.  If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull. 
 I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st.  Please take all other volumes on these deals to 0.  Thanks 
 I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk.  The backpack is dark blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it.  There is a yellow cooler inside and 2 flashlights. 
 I brought in my backback, 2 flashlights, and a small cooler type thing.  They are sitting on top of my neighbor's desk.  Come take a look when you get a chance.

 Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.  Dick and I will be chatting about this later today.  Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard about it. 
 We have a volumetric contract on Texas Gas and I'm not sure how to enter it in Sitara.  The volumetric demand charge is $.005, deal #461568 
 Uhhhh - You Bet.  Maybe they will send me home with cooked fish!! 
 I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you can use.  I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though. 
 Yes - a small one.  So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have fishing stuff too.  Where  are you going camping. 
 I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some boys are you???  I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could put some goodies in to keep them dry.  Do you need fishing stuff? 
 I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle this for him.  Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES? 
 Just send cookies then and we will be happy. 
 I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy. 
 You De Man! 
 I just entered the CES demand charges for August on the following deals  Deal 343896 - East demand charges of $655,443  Deal 231667 - Market East demand charges of $881,995  Thank you Melba 
 I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New Power).  I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing. 
 When do you take the bike to the shop?  I have your key on my keyring. 
 Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston. 
 Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.  Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.35 TCO Offer plus $.14  Good Luck

 FLARE IT!! 
 Contract      MDQ 
 We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226.  This is back on a month to month basis.  We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet. 
 YES WE ARE!! 
 We should have some impact from the following deals 456630, 456638, and 414075. I increased the price on 414075. 
 Hey team.  I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the following FOM numbers  1st-6th  51,762 7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st 27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st  Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through the 25th.  Not as much as I thought. 
 Little correction going forward  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.27 TCO Offer plus $.19 
 Who's gonna pay for my popcorn?  Did you like that pumpkin? 
 Remember the Titans!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.  ENA inherited this deal from CES.  This is a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.   I entered all the pricing and volume terms on the comments.  P.S.  Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra. 
 Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP, and his number is 614-324-5038.  Scott is THE MAN! 
 Done deal 454150 
 28213  I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.  Est Citygate for Nov  43,213 Storage Withdrawal  15,000  Net Purchase from ENA  28,213   Does this look correct?  We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).  AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone. 
 Sean may want to go to this. 
 The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power for the gas taken out of storage.  In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000.  Take a look - let me know if you have any comments. 
 Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.  Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet.  So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.  Comments? 
 Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + .0075 for 10,000 dth day starting on the 27th.  New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla. 
 We would have been around $.39 to $.42. 
 Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team.  I would like to have that please.   I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in November.  thanks 
 Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe.  I attached September, is this the month you are looking for? 
 I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator.  Take a look and let me know what you think.  Also, do you know the demand charges for the CGAS items highlighted in purple? 
 Did everyone see this? 
 Kim, please forward to the traders.  I think the schedulers have this already.     Please forward:  Room Change 
 Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now. We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary (be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.  She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.  I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?  I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!  Later 
 Update, Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers.  We hope to have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers. 
 CNG has new commodity rates effective 11/1/2000  New  Old $.0973  $.0462  Fuel remains unchanged at 2.28%. 
 Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.  The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.  Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.  Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.  Later Gator. 
 We both ran out of gas.  I just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when I did it.  That was the first time we went by the skydive place. 
 Run facilitation by location reports for November 1st for  Columbia Energy Services ???(Inc I think)  and  The New Power Company  and   Enron Energy Services, Inc.  thanks 
 Call me buddy.  Ingrid wants to come over and do a dog and pony show about Transco's new ??system?? I think.  AND I suggested she meet with EES and ENA at the same time.  I'm thinking around the 1st week in November.  What do you think? 
 I need to check this one.  We have several contracts with evergreen clauses. I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did. 
 I changed the end term date on cglf k#50250 from 10/31/2000 to 7/31/2001. 
 I changed the end date on CGLF k#42789 (deal 156388) to 10/31/2001. 
 Correction on the 4,018 dth from CPA (offer #30496), the receipt point is Broad Run, not Leach. 
 Are you guys looking for people?  I have a call from an ex KN Energy lady looking for a job.  Name  Sharon Dale Beavers Phone 281-397-85285  Let me know. 
 I know, tell all the women you know. 
 I meant the top 4 contracts 
 You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's contracts to ENA. 
 Opps.  You don't work for CES anymore. 
 Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I won't execute these until I hear from you.            The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff gave us the OK on this one. 
 CGAS storage looks good.  We are still working on the ohters.  I should have a better feel by tomorrow afternoon. 
 You're on!

 Come chat with me when you get a chance.  I see you are not at your desk, as usual. 
 Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ? 
 Please give my EOL id the ability to trade Canadian Gas products.  My ID is ADM81300.  Call me at 3-4743 if you have any questions. Thanks 
 Please send me the August invoice for CES.  Did we do any manual billings for August?  I need those too. 
 hey you, everything is still the same but here they are just as a double check  Zone Comm  Fuel 1-1 .0653  .35% 2-2 .0694  .46% 3-3 .0792  .45% 
 Give me a copy of the invoice.  thanks 
 I just called Lincoln Life - Dad's mutual fund.  He will mail me the forms to fill out today. 
 James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the contract:  MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000 The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61  What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day. What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61. 
 I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.  Could you email me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August? 
 Let me know the deal # after you enter it in Sitara.  Thanks 
 Are you looking at the imbalance trade behind NIMO with Amerada Hess for April 2000? 
 I think everyone needs a good wife! 
 I didn't go to the shipper meeting.  We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy that works for us now.  You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back when.  He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.  My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.  No new news - I hope to find out more next week.  Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!  Tell Muffy I said hi! 
 If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from someone else.  The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.  And this was the only time we ever used the agency on CNG. 
 ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and we wanted to transfer title at the pool.  I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning. He is terminating the agency. 
 Did you call me?  I have a message from Mike at 3-5480.  It ain't your voice on voicemail. 
 Cute, I want one!! 
 I will be out the week of the 13th. 
 Please forward to Don, my email is not going through. 
 I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via interoffice to Jeff.  There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.  How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal. 
 Victor, doesn't matter to me.  You pick - Mr. Goodell or someone else. 
 Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September.  These are the deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep.  Would you check on them and let me know what you find out? 
 I'm having a problem sending this to Don.  What is eamil? 
 I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better winter riding gear.  We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should only take about five minutes.  That's all I have for now. 
 Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some winter motorcycle gear.  My brother and I are taking a biking trip in November - don't know where we are going yet.  How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now? 
 We are missing 2 deals, 433359 (sale) and 433385 (purchase).  Please redraft and let me know if you see these. 
 Nuthin I want to put in writing. 
 I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink.  Oh yea, you already did!    Enron North America Corp. 
 I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different format. 
 Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.  I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, everything should be billed through the system. 
 Please redraft the New Power September activity.  I'm looking for the deals shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811.  If you see the items above, please send me a new worksheet.  Thanks 
 Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000   Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment 47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes below 4,723 per day. Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.  21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below  21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below   Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October? Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or monthly quantities? 
 I just entered the following 2 deals in Sitara for September, deals 433359 and 433385.  Please path these deals in Unify.  Thanks 
 Oh my, he's a big fella.  The quality looks great. 
 I'm scheduling it. 
 Call me, lets chat. 
 I have 17 days of vacation.  I'm rolling over 5 days which means I have 12 days left.  I think I can easily take off a week in November.  How about you? 
 http://houston.cowparade.net/ 
 We bought back some of New Powers first of the month volumes on deal 431846. Please match this deal with 431849.  I did this deal on the 5th and its effective the 7th - 31st. 
 Yes I wuz! 
 I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get in their groups and talk.  Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob Supperty about this,. 
 We need to confirm all the data on Mark's worksheet.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify. 
 Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical? 
 Hey Don, I'm still working on this.  I should have an idea by this Wed. 
 Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to BUG if this happens. 
 Adams Automotive at 713-932-0934. They are located at 1010 Blalock, across from the Fiesta, off I-10.  They may be a little pricey, but you can trust them.They only to do what is needed, and their service is excellent!!!  I'm glad you like the sweatpants. It turned cold and rainy today. I should be wearing mine today!!!  I got me a townhome... the contract will be signed on Tuesday. I really like it. It is 3 Bedroom and 2.5 baths with a garage. Faces the woods, Muffy will have fun exploring.  Thanks again for driving us here safely. 
 Then try AEP in Columbus.  They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there. 
 Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.  When do you leave Houston? 
 Robin, I can never remember if NYPA is your customer or Craig's - AND I can't find him in my email directory. 
 I created a new deal because this one has so much data on it. 
 I'm putting the freezing one on my webpage with a few happy hour photo's as soon as I get off my lazy butt. 
 Chat with Sean, I don't know if the room is big enough for everyone. 
 You can set up your own photo album online. 
 We'll chat later.  I'm trying to get an invite to Florida for a CNG thingy next week.  Leave Wed come back Friday.  May not happen. 
 I'm looking at last night's New Deal report.  I see deal 425325 with a loss of $236,000, but I don't see deal 425332 with a big positive number anywhere.  Any ideas?

 FINALLY, it's about time we hear from you.  I'm glad you're focused on schoolwork.  That's where your mind should be anyway.  I'll plan on seeing you on Nov 4th. 
 Transco response 
 Jerry and I bought motorcycles.  I LIKE!  Are you still looking at getting a camera - an ELPH??  Is that a digital? 
 You Bet.  I may have you a helmet too. 
 That contract should also be on the list.  I sent something to VNG about that.  I'll follow up on it.  GOT my mototcycle - guess what I did all weekend after my little East Texas Trip.  I need to get a tattooee now. 
 No chic - business trip.  May not go because tickets are $900.  I waited toooooooo late doggoneit. 
 I've never heard from the dude.  I may send him a voicemail. 
 Once again you've made me proud! 
 We added a Transco meter to deal 30512 today.  Would you make sure none of that goofy financial stuff is impacted please? 
 Update  Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend.  we withdrew $750.00 from the Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union.  I also took the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00.  AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union.  later dudes 
 Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables are netting to 0.  For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment to Clinton.  Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money! 
 Would you send Marlene a copy of the Equitrans agreement next week?  Thanks

 Correction deal 418015 is really 418051. 
 I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;  Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.  Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).  Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG deal, a confirm is faxed to them.  AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most of the pricing done in a worksheet. 
 Yep.  Guess I'll leave Monday to get there. 
 Robin, this is for the 5500 dth/day baseload sale and the 5500 dth/day put option in Tenn Z4.  This is Mo's deal.  Dick Jenkin's believes we should be paying a demand charge.  I 
 You De Man! 
 Probably won't get to it until after the 1st is done.  I think it will be easy to figure out though. 
 Hmmm.   Victor Guggenheim?  OPPPPS. 
 I may still be here working on this new deal.  Or I may be drinking beer at Little Woodrow's. 
 Nope. 
 I need the WSS meter number.  I would like to get that from VNG.  I'm sure we don't have that set up in our system. 
 There's always a profit in gen-tile and calm.  I'm Judy's boy.  I know nothing about Vickie.

 When did Bay State bill ENA for this?  And, did Bay State pay there bill for gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?  It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09. 
 I entered ($4.9951) x 12dt which should give them a credit on the invoice.  I also entered a demand of $93835.00.  These items should show up seperate on the invoice. 
 I sold the Niagara/Nat Fuel back to the Central Desk for the rest of the month.  Please take the 16,500 dt of Trco Z6 to Z6 space to 0 in Sitara for the balance of the month.  Thanks 
 Russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in Sitara before the agency contract is in Global.  That makes things quicker for Scott and I. 
 Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas? 
 Russ,  Please add all the following trading pipes/zones to the VNG desk.  Pipeline  Zones TRCO   All CNG   All CGAS   All Tenn   Zones 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 Tetco   All Texas Gas  Zone 4 
 Brenda, Vickie is our new Tenn transport person.  Please give her our most recent set of Tenn invoices to look at.  Thanks. 
 You're good! 
 Trip was busy but productive - got more free food.  I didn't get home until 10:15pm Tuesday.  I'm still tuckered.  Give Muffy a hug for me. 
 Hi there.  We changed our CGAS storage numbers today and we have fixed the Sitara deals and worksheet. 
 Don't make any changes for now.  I need to draft a more detailed memo. 
 Go to the first website shown below (http://www.enerfax.com).  Scroll down once you get to this website and you will see an article about fuel cells. 
 6:45 or so works real well for me.  Where do you guys want to feed me? 
 Where do you guys want to take me? 
 What if we did this tonight?  I have a work shindig tomorrow night that I just found out about. 
 Jerry, this may be news to you.  I would like for the 3 of us to have dinner Thursday evening and you are buying.  Comments - questions? 
 AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.  The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following  Sales Price  $5.4850 Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident) Storge Injection  $.0249 Capacity Demand $.0400  Total Price  $5.7025  We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).  Thanks 
 Effective 9/15/00 ENA sold NIPSCO 500,000dth storage see deal #401601. Adjusted the deal # 268093 & #268090 on the CGAS storage worksheet. Please make the necessary changes in TAGG        Tks Chris 
 According to Brenda we owe Egan 101 dts (per Egan's statement) on the expired Egan storage contract.  Jesse, would you verify this with Egan and find out what they want to do?  Thanks 
 Dick, use this worksheet to calculate NIPSCO's price.  Scott, Dick may have you look at this.  The prices in Column H are for capacity demand charges.

 Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.  The FSS balance is 797,464 and the ISS balance is (797,771).  This is better.  We need to pay back another 307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.  I know you guys will make me proud. 
 However, I will be flying out of Baltimore Monday morning and I'll be dressing business causal.  I'm leaving tonight. 
 I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of (797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.  Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling this please?  Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.  Thanks 
 I added Meredith's photo to the web page below last night. 
 I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.  Dan will be out Monday but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore. Judy is out in the afternoons.  So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.  Vickie's role has not been fully explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow. 
 I gave to Kim Olinger. 
 Jim, deal 226121 is our long term CNG pool sale to EES - the volume is around 1,000/day each month.  Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August.  Whats up? 
 Where are the actuals coming from?  Is this someone changing the supply matched up with the Clinton deal? 
 I'm here.  Judy and Scott Goodell are out. 
 I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.  Comments/Questions? 
 I called your work number and noooooo body anwsered!!!!!!!  We are going to lunch with Dan today. 
 Deal 220903, should be 0 now.  Thanks.  Marlene, we terminated Egan Hub contract ENA-0001 effective 8/31/2000.

 I just added a Koch demand charge on the sheet but it is 100% reimbursed. 
 Here is my online photo album.  Go to the following address;  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp  Go to the box on the bottom right part of the screen where it says "new to cartogra?".  Enter the my account name "trogg522" in the white box and click on the arrow beneath that.  Let me know what you think.  I can probably add another 7 to 9 photo's. 
 I'm glad you like your gifts.  I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I took up sewing (for Hector) and metal working type stuff for your goodies. I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.  I'm out Friday, Monday, and Tuesday.  AND I've been putting photo's on the web.  I bought a digital camera.  Take a look .  Go to ==>  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp Then go to the box in the bottom right side of the screen where it says "new to cartogra?".  Enter my account name "trogg522" in the space beneath and click on the arrow.  Later :o) 
 Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were notified 1 month after the effective flow date.  Comments?  Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk.  Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity. 
 I killed deal 396265 and added the demand charge to deal 124109. 
 I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal. I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept having problems saving the deal so I created a new one.  Let me know if this works. 
 I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091.  I wonder if there should be an Internal demand charge for $.09? 
 According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65  Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.  Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense? 
 Your cigars from Teal Lodge are in my drawer, both are in metal cases if you come by when I'm not here. 
 We are at a $5.44 in storage on CGAS.  I don't think I can give you anything on CNG but I'm still checking.  Just assume I can't and I call you if I find something.  The screen went up $.20 today. 
 I have Steve and Lisa on the internet at this web address  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp  Enter the account name "trogg522" in the box on the bottom right. 
 Help!  You are wonderfull! 
 We increased our CNG demand charges by $26,400 today. 
 i don't care if you delete it.  its of steve gillespie and his wife. 
 Do you have a copy of Maureen's deal ticket? 
 Baby shower photo from last night. 
 I was going to send you a photo of your woman from the baby shower but I can't load it from work.  I'll send it to you next week. 
 Send me a new download, I want to see if the changes worked.  Thanks 
 Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.  Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.  I was concerned that we would double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on the Physical Forward sale as well. 
 Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion Project.  Bids are due Thursday, Sep 29th.  Momentum is expected to be in service by 5/1/2003.  Shippers can elect the following receipt points, St 65, St 85, or Destin. The primary delivery point is St 165.  The minimum term is 15 years.  I will still be here doing transport. 
 This impacts the following deals in Sitara,  Deal 222734 - purchase from Alliance Deal 265943 - purchase from Meng Deal 227992 - transport usage 
 I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.  Before the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.  After the change its (CGAS - $.30)x(1-.0492).  This widens the spread by about $.24. 
 SST and we always assume we are using FTS. 
 You changed the rate on this deal from $.0227 to $.0358 effective 8/5/00. What's up with that girl? 
 I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a big OA variance for June - August.  This deal is for deliveries to Storage.  Would you verify if ACA and GRI are billed for storage deliveries please? 
 You are funny.  I laughed for 5 min when I saw this. 
 We are having a happy hour for Dan tomorrow.  Would you like to come?  I have not decided where to have it yet. 
 I'm there! 
 I changed deals 268090 and 268093 effective 9/7/2000.  We plan to have storage maxed out by 9/30/2000 and there will be no injections for October.  Comments, questions??  Will this cause any problems with the Choice program in October? 
 What are deal tickets 299159 and 299192? 
 I'm looking for an invoice from El Paso Field Services for July 2000 production.  The rate should be $.05 and the volume should be around 37,000.  Have you seen such a thing? 
 I'm all over it.  I have 2 plane tickets, one for Monday evening, the 18th, at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning,  19th, at 6:45am.  Knowing what a wonderfull morning person you are, I will probably leave Monday evening.  AND I will be in town next weekend.  Who is giving you a pool party?? 
 With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the delivery points.  I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact on what we flow in Z6.  Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let me know if you need specific capacity examples. 
 Opps.  I made an error.  This is a Sep 2000 contract.  I changed the term on deal from 6/1/2000 - 9/30/2000 to 9/1/2000 - 9/30/2000. 
 We have a new Transco 6-6 contract.  Term  9/6 - 9/30 Contract # 3.6878 MDQ  4,752 Rec  Leidy #6161 Del  Mainline BG&E #7221 (Non New York)   Please enter this on the morning sheet.  Thanks 
 I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.  If we no longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies. What do you think? 
 You need to give me a boottle in a  brown bag. 
 On the 8th TP2 sold VNG 10,000 dth at st 65.  This volume was entered on deal 760980, which is a VNG buy from Gulf 1.  I took the volume on this deal to 0 for the 8th and created deal 780794 (VNG buy from TP2 at St 65).  Please make a note in you files.  Meredith, you will need to repath these deals on the 8th.  Thanks 
 I thought I would sleep in the car, or maybe a shelter. 
 Shipper Meeting 
 I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday, 19th.  It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable.  Sounds good to me.   I told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and just get my money back for the one I don't use.  I would buy one leaving Monday evening and the one for Tuesday morning  COOL, don't you think? 
 Anyone interested??  Read below

 Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect. Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss how to correctly handle this in our system.  We also have some other supply behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly. Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East Ohio??? Any others?  People I need in attendance Mary Theresa or Jeanne Steve Gillespie Angie Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group)  This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet. I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the deals to this new pipeline. Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie.  I need you to go into escript (Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this system.  These are actually CES passwords.  It is my intention to use this information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara. 
 Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.  Dara, are you volume manangement?? 
 Uhhhh - - - - - - -  Yea.  Whoo Hooo.  Hold me back.   I feel the excitement.  Just kidding, hope your day is full of wonders!!! 
 The PPL contract number for September is 523489, volume= 2,400. 
 Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend.  I adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.  We will inject 31,463 on the 1st, and 31454 on the 2nd-5th.  Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th. 
 Colleen, we still show the 1,000 dt/day of Equitrans capacity on our CES (now New Power) sheet.  Do you know if CES ever agreed to take this contract? 
 I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS.  I had to create a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to "The New Power Company".  Joanne,  I made a change to Aug 31st.  Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.  Let me know if anyone has questions.

Paul, you should be able to execute this space before 9:00 am and re-release it to me (company #7973).  thanks. 
 Kimat, I think either 226553 or 372096 + 227882 should be taken to 0 for September.  I'm taking deal 226553 to 0 for now. 
 Mr. Homco will have to answer that one. 
 I changed the demand charge for Equitrans k#270 on the Aug and Sep worksheet.  Would you let me know what the capacity deal tickets are and I will change Sitara as well.  thanks 
 Boo!  Mary's address is  Rt 1 Box 315 Alto, TX  75949 
 I just spoke with the lawyer.  We can't do anything until the end of September.  Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday morning and be appointed executor.

 Scott Hendrickson sold the 10,000 month of Power Gas Marketing supply behind East Ohio to EES (deal 380671) for the term of the deal.  The price is CNG index flat, and the term is 9/1/2000 - 10/31/2000. 
 Kimat, I copied Sep forward on deal 202939 to deal 380571 and changed the counterparty to new power. 
 I going with Suzanne Christensen and someone else and I going dressed just like I am, although I feel just a tad underdressed. 
 According to my Mr. Scott Goodell, deal 231667 is a true sale to CES for Allied Signal.  This deal just goes away on Oct 1st. 
 I copied deal 226703 to 380492 for Sep forward and changed the counterparty to New Power.  Robert, The volumes for deal 380492 are included in the FOM citygate sale. Bookout deal 380492 with 380503. 
 We sold the National Fuel back to the Canadian desk for June at NX1 + $.235.  The volume is 9189 per day, deal ticket 782980.  Kimat, please forward to the Canadian Book Admin. 
 Hey woman, how much vacation do I have left BEFORE i fill out a timesheet for the 2nd part of August? 
 The Power Gas Marketing supply for Sep is 3,000 DTH. 
 Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.  Take a look at my worksheet.  All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale. Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.  What about deal 202939?  Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very confusing the way I do it. 
 Ignore my previous email.  For now, just book out deal 372088 with deals 229344 and 229357. 
 Supply deal 376962 gets booked out with sale deals 227882 and 372096.  Effective October 1st forward, deal 372048 gets booked out with 227882.   Supply deal 372088 gets booked out with sale deals 229344 and 229357. 
 We may be carrying some of our NFUL payback balance into September.   The firm portion of the contract will terminate on 8/31/2000.  However, the payback part of the deal is IT and NFUL will let us carry this balance into September.  On the 30th, we will move our balance on deal 318682 into September.  NFUL will give us until September 11th to payback our balance. 
 I just sent you National Fuel Gas Supply contracts.   The contact at National Fuel contact is Joseph Bettinger, Senior Manager-Interstate Marketing Department.  Address 10 Lafayette Square Buffalo, NY  14203

 Jeff, welcome to the club.  We are going to send you, Ora Ash, Jeff Davis, and Cindy McGinnis some goodies.  You, Ora, and Jeff will get Enron shirts. Cindy gets a jacket.  Don't try selling this stuff on the street, OK?  I will be checking to make sure you pass the "goodies" on. 
 I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G? 
 Some questions about the 1st.  Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 dt/day.  This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply? 
 On September 26-28, Temmessee is doing work at the Lockport compressor station, which is accross the river from Transcanada.  This work will impact the amount of gas Nat Fuel can receive from TCPL at Niagara.  Max capacity is around 429,000 dth.  During the work, the estimated capacity wil be 300,000 dth.  Nat Fuel will have to cut firm shippers.   429,000 300,000 
 Chic-fil-a???  No problem 4,053,906 sounds good. 
 Good job Chris.  My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  Comments? 
 Perfect.  I will buy you one free coke!! 
 Let me know if you have any questions. 
 I think I see whats happening.  I believe deal 372088 is a bookout with deals 229344 and 229357.  Should it also be a bookout with deal 227882?  What about deals 169036and 217764?  What about dea 
 Please take a look at deal 372088.  Its a new deal that starts Sep 1st and it was entered in sitara on Aug 21st.  I changed the counterparty from CES to New Power. 
 Hi Team.  I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.  Effective September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.  All existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara.  If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to "The New Power Company".  Thanks 
 Thanks.  This all started last November - where did the time go??       Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 08/23/2000 04:28 PM 
 Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW. 
 Angie, would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551. Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction. 
 AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 ( a difference of 26dt's). 
 Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and monthly activity.  If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on April 30th was 13%.  Let me know if you have questions. 
 I'm not above groveling for affection. 
 Hi gang.  Please read the following and let me know what you think.  Also, what would be the best way to handle this. 
 I didn't buy it yet.   But I going to take a serious look at it. 
 I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well (other than the price).  I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the deal.  You have not sold it to anyone have you?  If not, I'm going to try to sell it to EES for the term.  And if I remember correctly, the volume is 10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?

 The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco. 
 Miss me?  Apparently not - no hugs from you.  Who is doing my Market area stuff and why didn't Alicia tell me she was leaving??  I guess we aren't the item I thought we wuz. 
 OK.  When accounting did their initial draft for June production, we had a volume of 1,089,120 on deal ticket 268094.  Today, this same deal ticket has a volume of 497,015.  I think this  was loaded back from Unify.  Can we get that fixed? 
 Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will get that fixed. 
 IT WORKS!!! 
 How's this?? 
 Hey Doug, I'm back in the office for awhile.  Let me know if you still have questions.

 It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?  So what are you doing this weekend? 
 I do now!! I'm a changed man, after this is all over, Jerry and I are going to buy motorcycles and take a bike trip.  He has started shopping.  Wanna buy 93 acres in East Texas?? 
 I'm a really sweet guy, especially now. 
 OK.  Different now.  Is it ok if I send Lexi her own thank you card?  I going to try and print a picture of the cows to send with it. 
 Steve, would you take care of this please?  thanks 
 We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.  Clinton (Latrove) should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.  The Power Gas Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 30th and then we will be out of the local production business.  We've tried to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it. Sorry. 
 Angie, would you go into July 31st and path 10,000 dt from deal 264613 (purchase from Power Gas Marketing) to deal 348393 (sale to EES) at meter #20100.  thanks 
 BOO!  Anyone there?  Chrisy is back at work now. 
 As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in Sitara.

 Hey buddy, can you just send me $20.00???  I won't be around for the happy hour. 
 We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM.  Comments ???? Questions????? 
 I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora on the National Fuel deal.  After adjusting for what we took out today, we owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.  Here are the points that I believe will work best  Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply. Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG. Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost. 
 Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to overlap the contract or do any segmenting.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey buddy.  I would love to take a tour.  I'm tied up with a family illness for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.  Great Idea though.

 Please send those to Scott Goodell and he will get them to the right person. I believe ENA should be paying all those bills effective 1/1/2000.  Scott's address is P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188  His number 713-853-7711  thanks.

 Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.  AND I just faxed you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.  I believe Heidi Boyd told me that ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me know what you find out.  Please include Scott Goodell on all responses. 
 YOU BET.  I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by Walgreen's for drugs, pick up a "guy" movie, then drop by the immer palace. 
 Hi gang.  I will be out of the office quite a bit over the next 4 weeks. Please make sure you copy Scott and Molly on all emails and send all faxes to Scott Goodell, just to make sure we don't miss anything.  Thanks 
 I took off all last week.  Chad was married last Saturday, and I spent the rest of the week at Dad's and the hospital.  I talked to Jerry today - He has been up there since last Wednesday.  The Dr. said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month.  They are taking him out of the hospital tomorrow or Wed.  I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while.  There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack. 
 This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.  According to my notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel.  It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September.  CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes.  So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075.  The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228. 
 Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".  Assume the rate you are looking at is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify is the filename "2000tran08".       Enron North America Corp.

 I just sold 3,000 dth to CES for July 31st, deal 348523.  Per Jeff Porter, this is an in-ground storage transfer.  Jeff is faxing me the form to transfer the gas from ENA's storage to BG&E's storage account.  The transfer needs to be completed by July 31st. 
 Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.  Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.  I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline. 
 East Ohio I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.  I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.  Thanks.   Peoples I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This deal also goes through October.  We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..  We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.  Let me know if anyone has questions. 
 Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it because of email problems.  It was in my "save as a draft" folder.   ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity.  My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy 
 As I mentioned below, we now have 17,000 dth of Z3 to Z4 space for August on k#.7537.

 Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.  Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.  Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I use?  I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting old. 
 Got it.  Thanks. 
 ENA sold the 10,000 dth of EOG pool supply from Power Gas Marketing to EES for the month of August at CNG IF flat - this is the same thing we did for July. 
 Can't make it but thanks for the offer.  I do plan on coming up some time this year. 
 Can you help out my buddy Mike?  He will probably take us out for a fabulous lunch. 
 I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made a mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  I do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This should only be a problem for May and June, I think.  Please pay the disputed amounts. 
 I owe you big time.  Send me a bill.

 She sure did.  Molly Sumrow. 
 Kim, please note I will be on vacation all next week, Jul 31st through Aug 4th. 
 Mike, here is the worksheet.  The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail East" and "CES Retail Mrkt".  Also, CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1. 
 It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the system. 
 As we discussed on the phone, Mike Garred with CES is requesting a copy of the CES demand charge sheet.  Please let me know if you approve. 
 We are still together.  But you just wait, there is still time, especially since I went to church twice yesterday and she didn't want to go at all.  She's a heathen like you. 
 Yo buddy!!  I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total by Pipeline.  Get back with you soon. 
 Add the demand to the commodity, that's comes out to $.0505, there is your nickle.  However, being that we work for a marketing company and recognize the value of fuel, we take that into consideration.  The pipelines don't usually. 
 Let;s you and I chat this afternoon about getting reimburse from Oglethorpe on Transco. 
 Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.  The start date is the 27th.  Currently there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).  The min demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.  The commodity is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00. 
 Is Denver around the block??  How about Colorado Springs - I think its closer. 
 Hi Gang.  Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon.  I will probably be out all week.  I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and take anyone else that would like to attend. 
 Very nice - now where did you say you and I are going on vacation?  I suppose we could make it driving trip to take advantage of your new car!!!   Did some boy buy that for you? 
 FYI 
 Just spoke with Pops.  I let him know that his favorite son (ME) will be up there this evening.  He thinks I'm in Lufkin. 
 Hey, I just created a new deal for this contract effective 8/1/2000.  I thought I had done this but I can't find the other deal I created.  The new deal #is 340210. 
    A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game warden asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"  The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."  "Pet fish?!" the warden asked.  "Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home."  "That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"  The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here, I'll show you. It really works."  "O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.  The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.  After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, "Well?"  "Well, What?" the man responded.  "When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.  "Call who back?" The man asked.  "The fish." replied the warden.  "What fish?" The man asked. 
 Just send me $50 and we won't worry about it.  I would also like a new golf shirt but I don't think I want the name Clinton on it right now.  Try to get me an AEP shirt. 
 Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to Oglethorpe on Transco.  Current Process ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.  New Process ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 318423, gas daily deal) ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel. 
 FYI    I requested fuel waivers from Canajoharie to Trco-Leidy for Aug and CNG said no.  I think they will still have the waivers to most of the citygates though. 
 Read below, are you interested? 
 FYI    The 4,000 the East Desk bought from Ontario for tomorrow will probably get constrained but we wanted to try it. 
 I changed the rate on transport usage deal 227992 from $.27 to .32.  Impact will be ($18,400)  I need your help  changing the curve formula - please. 
 I'll give you a call in the morning around 8:15 am.  Later Buddy. 
 Chat with Alan at EES, I bet its the same escript you currently use.   This might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things. 
 I sold CES 174 dt/day (deal 335917) from the 20th through the 31st,  at a delivered price of $4.395.  We are using ENA transport for pricing purposes. 
 Sorry dude, I don't have his number.  And I finished my first civil war book.  I'll try to get that to you.  Where should I invest my money? 
 How many deals have you done???? 
 Is this something Scott did for you?  He has been handling all the TCO activity.  Let me know if this is something I need to do. 
 I tried sending this email about 3 weeks ago and had problems.   So here it is. 
 Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month.  AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime.  Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.  Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi. With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy.  Let me know what you guys think. 
 Thank you for sending my drill book.  I believe I have the key your are looking for.  I also have a "Dog Care" book that fell out of Daisy's folder when I got her out of "jail".  I will have these items delivered to you as soon as possible. 
 Go to "Bulletin Board" Select "Operationally Available" 
 Lynn Burke with the CDC's needs to release some CGAS and CGLF capacity to CES/New Power for August 2000-July 2001.  She wants to know who she should release the capacity to for August.  ???? 
 The exchange deal numbers are 323558 and 323553.  Also, I changed the rate on Tenn deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0097.    thanks

 Things are always crazy around you, even when the rest of the world is sitting still. 
 How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt? 
 I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116.  We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight. 
 Dan does not know what this contract is used for.  I think it has (or had) something to do with the Boston Gas contract.  We currently use k#29667 for that.  I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000.  Comments / questions? 
 james r barker ees      patricia downey ees  donnie myers/na/enron     ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14. The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity.  My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy 
 Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.  The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1.  Please look at the following contracts/deals.  Contract Deal  Comment 779234  003589  Boston releasing to CES 771157  003668  CES releasing to ENA 771224  003786  ENA releasing to Energy Express  Contract Deal  Comment 779233  003581  Boston releasing to CES 771156  003666  CES releasing to ENA 771225  003785  ENA releasing to Energy Express    Thanks. 
 I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing. 
 I have to look for the house key at home.  I know I don't have it on my keyring.

 I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to $.0206.  We should get back 155,000 x $.2394 == $37,000 tonight. 
 Anyone there?  Helloooooo! 
 YES I AM.  What are the dates?  And I love your outfit today.

 Rosemary's replacement. 
 Hi Gang.  Doug found my mistake and the correct price is $4.6913.  I changed the price in Sirara.  Sorry Jeff. 
 Scoop 
 Too heck with the little toot. What about that camera info??? 
 Brace yourself.  I'm putting in the June charge of $6.26 !!!  I just got the invoice today. 
 This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.  The daily volume was 10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).  The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 + Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport   I just changed the price in Sitara.  My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.  Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.  Please correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.  Thanks. 
 FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.  John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer. 
 This is what you really want  http://www.ferc.fed.us/public/pipecomp.htm 
 Here is the transport sheet for July.  I believe its fairly current. 
 OK - what kind of car and where are you and I going on vacation? 
 I would like to RSVP for Judy Townsend and myself.  Is it too late, will we get a free lunch, you how Judy loves a free lunch.  Also, we will not be able to attend until around 11:30 am.  Let me know it thats ok. 
 I think we should try an evening meal again.  This is fun ain't it? 
 Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced  Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.  I'll look at the economics in the morning. 
 We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom. We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to chat with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information. 
 I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity. I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport expense.   According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small. Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.  Questions?? 
 Let's try next week, I'm bouncing in and out this week. And THANKS!!! 
 Joann, you may need to get with Chris Ordway on this.  Please let me know if we are still using any of the contracts listed below.  I don't think we are using them anymore. 
 I love Chic Fil A!@!! 
 I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May.  I need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount letter.  Gloria, Terry does not have the invoice.  Could you get me a copy please?  Thanks. 
 Colleen, this is the email response I received.  Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company called "Capacity Center"?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is authorizing these payments.  Thanks.

 Yep.  Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.  Took my woman and went to Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ pit.  I was very tired on Wed though. 
 Not a problem.  She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other stuff.  I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie. 
 Not hardly.  Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?  I will also need to travel back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family. 
 How's that going anyway?  I forgot I had a marriage "arrangement" in the works! 
 What about my camera info????? 
 Shame on you :o) 
 Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.  Per Marde, CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.  OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre. 
 We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.  The parking deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.  When we get cut by an upstream or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the supplies and markets. 
 Joanie Veselack is leaving.  She is going to PG&E in Bethesda 
 The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals.  Please let me know if there are any questions. 
 I will enter this deal in the system and let you guys know what the deal number is. 
 We are borrowing 110,000 dth (deal 322012) on Transco on the 30th and paying the gas back on July 1st (deal 322007).  We are paying Trco a one time fee of $.0386 (see below)  Volume   Fee 0 to 50,000  $.015 50,001 to 100,000 $.05 100,001 to 110,000 $.10 
 I'm still looking for other emails. 
 I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update.

 Jesse, I put in a buy deal to purchase the gas back from CES, deal 318748.   Robert, I entered a buy and a sale to capture the financial difference on CGAS, deals 318749 and 318750.  I may kill these deals if ENA purchases the gas back from CES at Mainline.  I'll keep you posted.

 ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio (10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks like this pool can be terminated.  Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th.  Let me know if anyone has any questions. 
 JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch! 
 The password is 2000tran07 
 John, call me when you get a chance.  I called 330-493-7790 and there is no voicemail. 
 I show no sales to CES for the month of July.  I created deal 315460 to bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 FYI.  I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170.  They are both Trco Non NY. 
 Hey Buddy!  I just had a chat with Kori.  She is very sad she didn't get a birthday kiss from you.  There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 7th and she will be there.  What do you think? 
 I would like to RSVP for Chad's party. 
 At my Dad's Sat and Sun.  Watching fireworks with Ingrid probably Mon or Tues.  We can go drinking one nite.

 Hi gang.  I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle of last week.  I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th to be 3,626,785 dth.  Let me know if you see something different.  Thanks 
 Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.   You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).  thanks 
 as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest 
 Hey buddy.  We are having all sorts of problems with St 30, 90% internal. You should try to sell to someone else if possible.  Maybe Williams?? 
 Went home and went to bed buddy!  So which of the lovely young ladies did you spend time with? 
 Tim, call Dick Jenkins about this capacity.  His number is 3-5136 
 No Burt Shears in our phone dirctory.  I also tried searching for just "Burt" and "Bert" and nothing came up with the last name sounding, feeling, looking, or smelling like a "shears". 
 This transaction involves 5 contracts.  Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of ($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.  I don't think Nat Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out. 
 My location is EB 3224b  and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me.  Thanks

 Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.  IAS  <== we just created k# A02353 ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262 FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.   Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning. 
 I called Peoples, Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any questions.  I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have not heard from him either.  Don't seem like anything is getting done.  I hope you had a good weekend. 
 Modest Too!! 
 Looky at what I just opened in my email.  I had some stuff tucked away in a different directory and I'm going thru it now.  Does this still need to be addressed? 
 We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.  FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day. However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.  COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.  Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.  Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today's prices that cost about $.105  Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.  Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.  Let me know if you have any questons. 
 Hey Rhonda, my sources tell me that this $3.324 is the correct price. Thats a big bonus for EES. 
 Check out this site:  > http://www.ozmasplace.cjb.net > 
 Good job.  Now what price should we bill EES. 
 Hey Greg.  Hope this works.  My phone number is 713-853-4743. 
 We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July.  k#  MDQ  Comment 5A2500  15000  Oak to BG&E  5A2551  4003  Corn to BG&E 5A2551  383  Lebanon to BG&E  5A2526  3947  Corn to Leidy  Total  23,333 dt   Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.  And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell. 
 Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.  k# 560104 5A2529 
 ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is correct?  Thanks 
 Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility.  Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review.  Thanks. 
 You must be busy today. 
 Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel. I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.  Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. 
 You will probably get an invitation to the wedding.  The date is Sat, July 29th, in Mangum, OK. at 3:00pm in the afternoon.  I'll expect to see you. 
 Good Boy!!!! 
 I'm working on your request buddy.  I should have it today or tomorrow morning. 
 I'm trying to change the Receipt Meter on deal 235367 from meter 7126 to meter 010902.  I'm not trying to change the Receipt Interconnect point, I'm trying to change the Receipt Point (From).  I can't change it.  Whats up? 
 I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find, I think. 
 So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because  they locked in the NYMX?

 My YTD nymx and your YTD nymx don't tie.  Here is my worksheet.  Would take a look at it and let me know which deals are wrong.  You are a wonderful person by the way. 
 Kay, I have a conference call with 2 of our outside attorneys at 2:00 PM on Monday so I may not be there.  I also sent the first response to Donna Greif, Kevin Brady's manager. 
 You gave me 2 invoices for CNR that are not on your April 2002 payment worksheet.  Producer	Volume		Amount J E Harris	815		$260.80 Carol Littleton	748		$239.36  Should I toss these 2 invoices or should they be included in the list? 
   I didn't make tooo many changes.  Take a look at Florida and Koch.

By the way, Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert.  I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.  I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.  Call me when you can, it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Later Gator Boo BOOO

 Why don't you guys plan an evening in Houston and I'll show you the trade floor.  I really prefer to do it after 5:30 these days.  It doesn't have to be this week, I was just thinking about it.  Maybe I'll get a free meal off of both of ya!!!!!!!!!!  NO - we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at HALF NAKED BRAZILIAN WOMEN WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  You are both a bad influence on me already. 
 This is what I have so far for Wholesale East TPort.  I need to research the rest. 
 I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.   We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward. 
 We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.  Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.  Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.  I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well. 
 I changed your col gas password from ou1rules to clg12dec.

Cinergy will not trade with Enron.  Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless.

 How many deals have you done???? 
    A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with two buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game warden asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"  The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."  "Pet fish?!" the warden asked.  "Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let them swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their buckets, and I take em home."  "That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"  The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here, I'll show you. It really works."  "O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.  The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.  After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said, "Well?"  "Well, What?" the man responded.  "When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.  "Call who back?" The man asked.  "The fish." replied the warden.  "What fish?" The man asked. 
 We are still together.  But you just wait, there is still time, especially since I went to church twice yesterday and she didn't want to go at all.  She's a heathen like you. 
 Sounds like they are having fun!  I lucked out, I have a doctor appointment at 2:15 PM today.  This is with my specialist up on 1960. 
 Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.  Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.  Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I use?  I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting old. 
 Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.  Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.  I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline. 
 I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!  What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?  Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married - yet) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.  I'm reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down. 
 YOU BET.  I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by Walgreen's for drugs, pick up a "guy" movie, then drop by the immer palace. 
 We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM.  Comments ???? Questions????? 
 It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?  So what are you doing this weekend? 
 The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco. 
 Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW. 
 I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G? 
 We sold the National Fuel back to the Canadian desk for June at NX1 + $.235.  The volume is 9189 per day, deal ticket 782980.  Kimat, please forward to the Canadian Book Admin. 
 Mr. Homco will have to answer that one. 
 Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.  Dara, are you volume manangement?? 
 On the 8th TP2 sold VNG 10,000 dth at st 65.  This volume was entered on deal 760980, which is a VNG buy from Gulf 1.  I took the volume on this deal to 0 for the 8th and created deal 780794 (VNG buy from TP2 at St 65).  Please make a note in you files.  Meredith, you will need to repath these deals on the 8th.  Thanks 
 I guess you don't have pictures for me do you?  I saw Traci Wood Tuesday evening at a little resteraunt on Westheimer called Paulie's.  Do you care? 
 We are having a happy hour for Dan tomorrow.  Would you like to come?  I have not decided where to have it yet. 
 Send me a new download, I want to see if the changes worked.  Thanks 
 Your cigars from Teal Lodge are in my drawer, both are in metal cases if you come by when I'm not here. 
 I called your work number and noooooo body anwsered!!!!!!!  We are going to lunch with Dan today.

 Go to the first website shown below (http://www.enerfax.com).  Scroll down once you get to this website and you will see an article about fuel cells. 
 I entered ($4.9951) x 12dt which should give them a credit on the invoice.  I also entered a demand of $93835.00.  These items should show up seperate on the invoice. 
 I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th. 
 Yep.  Guess I'll leave Monday to get there.

 Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.  The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.  Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.  Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.  Later Gator. 
 BETH!!!  Donna!!!   Welcome to the party!  Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.  1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?  2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes. 
 We would have been around $.39 to $.42. 
 Little correction going forward  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.27 TCO Offer plus $.19 
 Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.  Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.35 TCO Offer plus $.14  Good Luck

 Hey buddy.  Please allocate the followin deals to 0 for the 9th only.  My mistake and I will owe you for life.  deal 720977, 720959, and 720986 
 I missed this.  Looks like IT will not flow through St 90 
 I don't think the triggers are correct.  Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara. 
 I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing.

 I was going to call and harasses you but no one answered your phone.  I'm pretty sure my purpose on life is to make you miserable.  What do you think?  I will be out of the office this afternoon after 2:00 pm - Tenn shipper meeting. 
 According to somebody - housecats left outside kill over 1,000,000 tweety birds a day! 
 Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380. 
 I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy  :) 
 The truth is out there! --  ------- Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day    Computer Gender  An English teacher was explaining to the students the concept of gender association in the English language; noting how hurricanes at one time were given only female names, and how ships and planes were usually referred to as "she." One of the students raised her hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class into two groups:  males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.  The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.  The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.  3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. 
 Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines? 
 Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.  Comments, questions? 
 She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.  I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck. 
 Still looks like Columbia Gulf is selling Enron space. 
 Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?  If so give him a big kiss and a hug from me. 
 U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just kicked in somehow. 
 I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.  Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man? 
 I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email. 
 Ernie's on the team now. 
 You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is cushy?????? 
 Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV. 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".  That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!  What's up with you girl? 
 1.  May Only   $.4300 2.  May/Oct       $.4380 Jun/Oct         $.4400 Just wanted to show the diff between May and the rest of the summer.  Let me know how this looks.    3.  Nov/Mar  no offer 
 El Paso and Reliant don't have time to talk about right now but I'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns.  It's not the same as selling parked gas on Sonat.  Still working it though. 
 Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;  Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000? What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? 
 This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.  Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money. 
 Did she show you her tatoo?  I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  Your the boss, what do you think? 
 YES I AM.  What are the dates?  And I love your outfit today. 
 This isn't the right guy but he can get you to someone - Mike Garred x35488. 
 According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65  Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.  Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense? 
 Then try AEP in Columbus.  They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there. 
 Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston. 
 Please give Judy Townsend, Scott Goodell, and myself  the ability to trade the physical Canadian products.  We need to be able to see them on EOL.  Thanks 
 Hey there.  I was on vacation on the 9th.  I guess its ok to send out the invoice now. 
 Do these counterparties look familiar?  Call me when you get this please?  Thanks. 
 Very funny! 
 You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.  Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.  Behave yourself girl. 
 I just bought 5000 of M3 for June, deal 798154, under TP2. 
 o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/2001tran05.xls  We creat a new sheet each month.  And the the last 2 digits are the month - "05" = May get it get it get it?  Anyone can pull this file up.  You need a password to open the file and make changes.  The password is the file name.  I just didn't want people to make changes by accident (which I have done myself). 
 Call me when you get a chance please. 
 I'm busy on Friday, June 1st.  Why don't you stay home and wash your hair or something. 
 TP2 sold 6000 dt per day of Transco Z6 NY to Vladi (deal 801081) at NX1 + $.425.  I did not do this deal on EOL.  Please forward this email to Vladi's book admin.  Thanks 
 Would you please send me the commodity rates (including ACA, GRI, and Great Plains) for the following 2 releases:  Offer #23516 and #23517   And brother Jerry said "lets grab the women (he didn't say which ones) and go motorcycle riding on Monday". 
 I purchased 6172 day from the Canadian desk at NFUL Niagara (deal 802218).  The price is NX1 plus $.23.  The buyer is East TP3.  The seller may be wrong.  Please forward to Mr. Storey's book admin.  Thanks 
 HEY, we need PHOTO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I've signed off on the settlement.  Now when would you gentleman like to get together?  Both of you need to sign the settlement in front of a notary as well. 
 Uhhhhhh - very interesting.  You should call me so I can hassle you some. 
 I'm available. 
 I called you back and your phone rang 8 times so I hung up.  Trco 4-4 IT Feeder	Comm $.1672 Fuel      1.89%  Trco 4a-4 (mobile bay)	Comm  $.0746 Fuel       .57%  Remeber, the rates above are to St 85.  You need to add the following surcharges for other delivery points.  ACA   .0022 GRI    .0070 Great Plains    .0097 
 Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you.  That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L. 
 Scott Profitt was looking for your phone number.  I gave it too him.  I think he misses you. 
 Please change the counterparty on deal 806589 from TP2 to TP3 (sorry about that). 
 The volume on the deal listed below was changed from 6172 to 8240 per day.  Please forward to Geoff Storey's book admin.  Thanks 
 And what exactly will you be doing while I'm bumping up that magic number?? 
 You sure are sweet!!  2701 Revere St #221 Houston, TX  77098 
 Shooting for triple digits? 
 Actually I don't need any more as long as my prospective mate has 1 or 2 less than me :o) 
 Hey, it works for me. 
 I want PHOTOs!!!! 
 It's not her fault.  First, everything she does or knows is officially my business.  Second, I tortured her to get information.  Third, she's a great ol' big heifer (<==female cow often used to produce many offspring) and she really needs to go. 
 may05clg  ID cgerman  locations 3224b 
 Yes I have and I still don't like it! 
 Take a look.  Let me know what you think. 
 I called to hassle you and you were not there.  The lady from Mike's party called me today.  She wants to show me a couple of houses.  What do you think?  I told her tomorrow would be4 fine. 
 I have to keep working until you get here!!!!!! 
 Suzanne is here.  She said you and her are doing some Manual work this weekend.  You and I are breaking up for the weekend but I need to get my car back first.  Maybe after we go to the movie.  PS  Scott said the resteraunt to go to in Round Top is "Royers".  He said you go shop for antique crap and then go eat at this place. 
 I would leave early if I were you. 
 I finished all but one.  Guess what time I finished????  Oh, and we have until the end of today to finish them. 
 Did mine.  Need to do one for this person in risk management.  I finished at 12:15 
 I'll call later with a whole bunch of tedious contract changes. 
 We have some Trco long haul capacity for 1 year starting 5/1/2001, contract 3.8924.  This is a mini asset deal with PSE&G.  Transco has agreed to bill PSE&G for the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off the sheet and zeroed out sitara effective 5/1/2001. 
 Effective 6/1/2001, please move deal 655067 (sale to NYPA) from ENA - IM EAST TP2 to ENA - IM EAST TP3.  Jeanne, effective 6/1/2001, we are going to move the TGT transport from TP1 to TP3. 
 I dialed Suzie's number and Liz anwsered.  Then I asked to speak with the other ____zzy and she transferred me to Lauri.  I was expecting her to transfer me to you!! 
 Please set up and annuity for June where the TP3 book pays the New England book a total of $57,266  This will show up as a loss in TP3.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 she is at superior, do you need her for something?  what are you doing? 
 Kim, according to Dalton (the IT guy), I need 3 sets of monitor arms and Judy needs 2 sets.  Did you order my other monitor? 
 I changed the meter numbers on the following deals.  Please check the hedges.  Deals 816519 and 816524 
 I did take a look at the $139,000 home.  This house has been on the market for awhile.  The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.  Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.  Thanks for the info though. 
 http://www.cnet.com/  there is a lot of good stuff on this web site.  Click on "HARDWARE REVIEWS" then select "DIGITAL CAMERAS".  Lots  of good stuff. 
 Please give me view only access for the Power Products on EOL.  My EOL ID is ADM81300.  Thanks.

 I assume you and I are going to lunch tomorrow right before you go home to take a nap.  Right??????? 
 Not yet.  Thanks for your help. 
 Mr. Goodell told me you were the most wonderfull person in the world.  Would you please tell me what the demand charge is on contract 36647?  Thanks 
  hey I'm sorry about your summer vacation not working out.  it would have been cool to take all that time off but you wouldn't want to come back now would you? 
 The ENA counterparty on deal 810054 needs to be changed from ENA - IM ME TCO to ENA - IM EAST TP1.  Please change it or unvalidate it and I will change it.  thanks 
 Extended to 5/31/2001.  What was I doing on niteline???  I hope I wasn't doing something embarrissssssing. 
 I'll be right over wearing a cleaning lady skirt - just for you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.  What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!  Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.  I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00. 
 I'm coming over after I work out today.  I'm coming over after i work out tomorrow too.  I won't see you Friday or Saturday. 
 Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.  Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills.  CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill.  I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed.

 This is the demand charge for The New Power Market area demand charges.  It's under the "New Retail Mrkt" tab on 2001new03.xls.  They owe us the dough. 
 Sorry about that.  Rerun the invoice and send it to me.  Thanks 
 Dude, this needs your blessing. 
 done 
 What are your Trco volumes again?  I can make changes now without writing new deal tickets. 
 CALP released their 40,000 dth to ENA for Nov-01 through Mar-02.  The new contract number is 71451 and it should be set up in Sitara. 
 Our Texas Gas contract for Nov-Mar is k# T0181760000.  Our MDQ is 18,000 dth per day and the demand charge is $.01 per dth. 
 I just killed deal 1143337  TGT k#T018123, that was the wrong contract number. 
 TP1 sold 2000 dth to the New England book for November via EOL.  The price is NX1 + .445.  The point should be South Commack.  As of 10:44 am this deal had not loaded into Sitara for November. 
 Please change the volume on these tickets this afternoon.  I don't want to put them in pending status while you are scheduling.   Deal 646813  - volume should be changed from 465 to 572 for the month of November. 
 I have 2 contacts at Iroquois  You should probably talk to Robin Almond at 203-925-7274.  Thanks 
 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!   What am I going to do with my time???????   Fishing, sitting around in my underwear, spending money without repercussion, going to the BUFFFFEEEET at Ryans.  Heck, I might even make a special trip to Conroe to the best Ryan's in the WORLD> 
 I updated the NYPA volumes for November.  The Hub volumes are 15,201 per day (deal 30512) and the TGT Mamou volumes are 15,200 per day (deal 1063956). 
 I put both tickets in the box next to Sandra's desk.  Thanks 
 Sorry about that.  i do so few of these and i just asked andy about it.  i won't be doing any deals for anyone elses book in the future. 
 You need that for a 1 month index deal? 
 Sorry Troy.  I guess today is a bad day.  Probably after the 1st. 
 I just created deal 1131700, a purchase from Reliant for Nov 01 - Mar 02.  The price is NX1 + $.015.  Please enter this deal in Tagg.  Thanks 
 Please grant Robin Barbe the following origination from TP1.  Deal		Date	Volume	Orig	Tot orig 1129458	10/24	2880	$.02	$58 1125595	10/23	2952	$.02	$59  Deal 1129458 is in the New England book.  I did a desk to desk with TP1 
 Here's another one, 500 dth from Z0/ZL to Dungannon for Nov-Mar and / or  Apr 02 - Oct 02.  I'm guessing max rate.  Let me know.  I just want to make sure you have it to sell.  Also, how does the open season work? 
 I will be taking a (much) later lunch today.  I mean look at the time and I'm still here.  And you all know how food pretty much ranks number one in my life too.  Call me on my cell if you need me.  832-867-3346.  I'm not sure what time I'll be leaving.

 My questions to Tenn 
 Boston Gas DIfferential for Oct 2001 = ($.0641) 
 I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to sell.  Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and Nov-1year.  Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.  Thanks 
 I know you told me that this capacity could be released.  Can it be released in 4 seperate peices?  Plus I may be doing permanent releases too.  Any problem with that?  Does this contract have an evergreen clause? 
 Who is my contract for capacity release questions? 
 Hey there.  Got your message.  I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon, maybe today.  Thanks 
 I believe its Janice Felton but I will make sure.  Thanks 
 Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.  Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?  Let me know. 
 Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.  So I have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.  I propose that I stay home and be a house husband.  You would have a hot (oatmeal) meal waiting for you when you get home.  The dog would love you, the cat would love you, I would love you.......  What do you think? 
 Put me down for $25.00  NOT PER MILE YOU CRAZY WOMAN> 
 IT	FT	Fuel		FT Demand Onshore-Mainline	.0387	.004	.697%		$1.0603 = $.0349 per day  Mainline-Leach		.1225	.0191	2.902%		$3.145 = $.1035 per day  All rates include ACA but no GRI. 
  I'm still passing out your name and number to people that are looking.  I only give it to people that I think would fit in a capacity role.  Are you OK with that or should I stop? 
 You should call me so I can harass you. 
 I get real tired of this guy.  For whatever reason he and I just don't seem to comunicate real well. 
 Forget it.  I don't need your lecture. 
 I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.  Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it.  Thanks 
 FYI - just sent this note to Tenn. 
 Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my notes.  Thanks

 We have a discounted IT rate of $.25 for Oct.  Receipt Points are 500L & 800L, Delivery points are Tenn Z6. 
 I thought you mite do that  :o) 
 My girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around January.  But not too many people know about that.  If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it.  Don't want no kitties.  I'm going home now because I've lost so much money today.  BYE 
 In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.  ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019. 
 This is the guy in charge of all the transport for Cinergy.  I have not been able to speak to him because he is out of the office so much.  And I don't know if I'm still in his good graces either.  Paul Drexelius  713-393-6856. 
 Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.  As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.   However, we do support intra-day capacity release. 
 I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore.  What are you doing? 
 Got it. 
 done 
 Could you send me the confirm for deal 415547, also contract no. 96017703.  This deal is effective 11/1/2001 - 10/31/2002?  Thanks 
 Done. 
 When are we going to dinner?  Have you ever been to Paulies on Westheimer close to Shepherd? 
 I can't log in.  Its been messed up since I changed my password.  I'm good = for lunch too. 
 What are you doing for lunch? 
 Are you in today? 
 Julie, I'm leaving at 10:00 AM today.  Please let Scott, Maureen, or Robin know what you find out on the Boston Gas deal for the winter.  Thanks 
 I based Sep off the CNG index. 
 You are my hero. 
 go to www.publicdebt.treas.gov.  the term is 30 years but you can cash them in after 6 months.  If you cash them in b4 5 years, you lose three months intere

 The Boston Differential for Sep 2001 is ($.1187). 
 A.K. is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1, 2002.  I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.  A.K.  I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.  As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well. 
 let me know if you have any interest in the Tco-Pool Leach swap for the winter.  I'll take TCO pool at Index and sale Leach or Pool at Index - $.04.  I can't remember if you guys could do it or not. 
 Could you tell me what deal tickets you are seeing? 
 I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June.  I can't remember.  I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year.  I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico. 
 I can't get through on the phones.  Please call me 713-853-4743 
 Hey Ernie.  I'm checking my emails.  I assume you have your anwser and don't need me. 
 What's happening?  I understand you have a brand new truck.  Must be nice having money!!  I need 2 things from you.  1.	I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name.  What do you think?  If that's ok, how do you want your name to show up on 		the title and what address should I use?  2.	I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock.  How many of Dad's shares do you have?  Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working. 
 We have a discount on Tenn k#2891, Z0 and 500L to Carnes for Oct 1-31st, up to 20,000 per day.  Rate = $.12 
 Looks like I have the wrong contract.  thanks 
  Let me or Gerald know if you have any questions. 
 I'm trying to find the original tickets for the following deals with Northern Natural Gas.  Can you guys help me with this?  Deal 		Deal Date NK7775.1	5/31/2000 EE9092.1	12/16/1997 EE9092.3	12/22/1997 E23290.7	12/16/1997 
 Did you get your info? 
 The End Date on the following Park & Loan contracts has been extended from 9/30/01 to 10/31/01.

 Robert, Rhonda may be adjusting the Leach volume (14,288) up or down a few dth's to balance every day.  That's ok.  Somebody tell Barker what a nice guy I am. 
 When I look up this contract in Passkey, I show an MDQ of 16,373.  We think it should be 4723 with the following primary receipt points. Leg	MDQ 800   	1228 500	897 Z0	2598  I might be looking in the wrong screen.  I am going under contracts/contract maintenance/review 
 Got my ID and password fixed.  Thanks.  Has Corey said anything to you about my park and loan contract?  I just tried to call him but there was no anwser. 
 I'll be at the Texas Gas shin dig. 
 ????  At Leach or the Pool. 
 I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.  The volume is 14,288 per day.  The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.  This deal will not change.  The sale deal is #1068455, at CGAS IF - .05.  I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.  Robert, please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use.  We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.  It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month. 
 Would you change the desk on deal 1064348 from Gulf2 to East TP1 please? 
 These are the mid values for the following deals.   Deal		Book			Mid Value 1065846	TP3 selling to TP1	NX1 + .13  1065497	TCO selling to TP3	NX1 + .08  241639		TCO purch from AEc	NX1 + .08 219618		TCO sell to AEC	NX1 + .08   Kimat, would you enter deal 1065846 and 1065497 in Tagg please?

 TP1 sold 323 day at CGLF IF + .0175 for Oct, deal 1064505, to EES. 
 Thanks. 
 When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.  Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).  TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact. 
 FYI 
 I moved the sale to NYPA at Mamou from TP3 to TP1 effective 10/1/2001.  The old deal number is 815952.  The new deal number is 1063956.  Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?  Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1. 
 We have an discount on Tenn, for the 25th only.  k#2891, MDQ = 5000, rate = $.30, Receipt point = Z0, delivery point = Tewksbury in Tenn Z6. 
 The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.  Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.  Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not. 
 Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.  Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost. 
 I sold 4,035 dt to the Ontario Desk on NFUL for Sep at +.12 (deal 1016673).

 I'm going to make it a TP1 deal.  Robert said there are no service deals in Unify, so I will set up new tickets effective 11/1/2001. 
 We are buying the following Tenn transport from the pipeline for the winter.  I just did the deals so I don't have the contract numbers.   Term		Demand	Comm	MDQ Nov		.18		.02	3893 Nov-Jan		.20		.02	2500 Feb-Mar	.20		.02	2500  The Primary delivery point is CGAS - Broad Run.  The primary receipt point is meter #010698 in 500L.  We will be able to use any zone 1 receipt point but we only be able to use Broad Run as our delivery point. 
 SWEET CAKES!!!!!!!!!!  I'm ok.  Still looking for employment opportunities.  Give the kitties a squeeze for me! 
 Should I call you up and sing !?!?!!?!?!?!?!   How's the "boy" doing?  Still madly in love?  What's it like - being madly in love that is?

 Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me  Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.  Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book 592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England 223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England  415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1 415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1 1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1  When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).   Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.  Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC? 
 What do you guys think about the following set ups for the Egan park and loan contracts?   Parking				Loaning Pipe Code		EGHP				EGHP Firmness		IT				IT Service Type		Interruptible Parking Service	Interruptible Loaning Service Rate Schedule		IPS				ILS Term			Term				Term Contract #		EGHP IT Parking - 001		EGHP IT Loaning - 001 
 For the 6th, I borrowed 19,903 dth from EGHP (deal 1158684) and I must pay the all the gas back by Friday (deal 1158685).  Since we are borrowing the gas first, we should path this gas on contract # EGHP IT Loaning - 001.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Thanks. 
 The end date on #21 (contract # 58654) is 4/30/2005.  The demand charge on #21 and #17 is $3.145 per month.  Also, ACA changed from $.0022 to $.0021 on ALL the CGLF transport. 
 I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.   Here are the deal numbers and volumes.   Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment 1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach. 1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport 1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline 1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.   I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.   Thanks for your support. 
 I told Judy she was going. 
 Please grant the following origination to Robin from TP1, deal #1162682.  thanks 
 cgerman qqq333qqq 
 Lets see, stock is trading at $7.29.  I believe you will see lots of folks looking for employment elsewhere. 
 Hey girl.  Who are you working for?  You know all my favorite women (except for Judy) work for EnronOnline. 
 If we are still here that is.  ENE is at $7.36 - mood isn't so good. 
 You got that right!!! 
 maybe 
 CGLF contract 42789 has been extended to 10/31/2002. 
 I need you to sell my truck and campers.  You get 10% commission plus expenses.  I need money now more than ever. 
 Hey!!!!!    Is the wedding still on for Sunday?  IF YES, then, are we invited or do you want to keep it small?  IF NO, then, hey I understand - I'm not sure what we are going to do either.  She doesn't like the Vega idea. IF YES, then, when and where? 
  let me know how you do.      - intelligentietest.htm 
 JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii....................  I'm ok.  I'm leaving.  Talk to you later and thanks. 
 You may or may not want this but if here it is just in case.  Thanks 
 djunek@aeglobalmarkets.com  I chat with him via aol instant messenger.  His id there is djunek13.  He's not in the office today.  your msn doesn't work. 
 Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.  And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me. 
 Does this email still work or is Enron trying to control all info in and out of the building? 
 I'm cool.  How are  the kitties?  Ingrid is starting to expand, of course she's not as big as me yet. 
 The TCO book is buying 1,000 dth per day from Power Gas Marketing at Trco-Young Women's Creek.  Effective 11/9/01, CNG began restricting receipts from Trco-Leidy.  We are taking 543 dth into CNG, VNG has 543 dth of primary receipts at Leidy on CNG.  STEVIE, till further notice, the VNG book needs to sell the New York Book 453 dth of Trco Non NY, use deal 1165693. The transport usage ticket is 1165849, and the buy from TCO is deal 1165737.   GOOD LUCK! 
 Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.  What would you have me do?  Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.  So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job? 
 Due to credit concerns, Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with.  Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply. 
 Steve, I forgot to mention that we are using the Utos to Leidy contract #.6507 to flow the 6-6 volumes. 
 I sold my CGLF to Susan today so you dont need to worry about it on Monday.  I'm flat CGLF. 
    And you thought I didn't have anything ready.  I sent this to Paul yesterday, he said "I'll keep it and see were to fit you in, you should have come when I asked you to"  I guess he's unhappy with me. 
 We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new.  Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months.  I had a jury duty summons this morning.  I didn't get picked and we got out at 1:00 PM.  Sell my truck yet? 
 here kitty, kitty , kitty, ....   Oh this is funny. 
 Hey, I was waiting for you at the shark club and  you never showed up.  I think you stood me up!!!?!?!?!?!?!?   What's the deal?  Is that how you treat a buddy?  I may not show up the next time. 
 Can you tell what Sales deal this is going to? 
 How would you like it if someone pulled out your claws????? 
 come on now.  YOU NEED THAT COMMISSION!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Are they billing us for 530 dth of transport?  If yes, then its the VNG desk. 
 I see that Shemin is out until next week.  Since you are becoming a law guru you might know the answer to this question.  The following document is an order from the court.  Does that mean it has been filed and is in effect now? 
 I gave it back to my assistant and asked her to cancel it.  I have a company cell phone and I don't need a calling card.  thanks 
 Robin Barbe just gave me a couple of day care's to sign up for.  One of them is St. Luke's at Edloe and Westheimer.  The other one is Becker's at Sunset and Rice.  AND Robin just told me that St Luke's is Methodist, they have an 8:30, 9:45, and later service. 
 Hey, how does this get me a new job?  Should I study these and know them by heart? 
 We have a discounted rate of $.1028 on IROQ for the 17-19th, flowing gas from Wadd to Wright. 
 Our contact for this is Janice Felton.  Her number is 713-267-4210.  Please call her on Monday and let her know that ENA wishes to terminate contract 37393 effective 5/31/2002.  Ask her what she needs in writing from us then draft it and send it to her attentions.  Thanks

 You guys need to come see my new building before I quit, get fired or whatever.  We moved into the new building over the weekend. 
 And, because I waited so long, it should be done in a great big hurry! 
 I'm wonderful thank you very much.  Where have you been?  How are you doing? 
 I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face, she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.  She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today. 
 According to my calculations, TP1 demand charges should be $1,115,826 for Nov.  Would you change that for me?  Thanks 
 You lucky girl.  Let tell me all the interesting stuff that's going on!!!!!!! 
 I don't know how this asset management deal works on demand charges.  Could you give me a demand charge report out of Unify please? 
 I WANT TO GO.  Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.  I'm almost positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).  You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat. 
 The deal didn't go thru.  sorry about that. 
 Is there a way I can see the amount of gas on my storage contract on the EBB?  I looked yesterday and I even tried the "help button" but I couldn't find anything.  The contract number is 15692. 
 Early this afternoon would be fine, say around 1:30 PM.  My new location is 06456.  Thanks 
 Would you check on this when you get a chance.  Let me know if I need to yell at someone.  Thanks. 
 Please grant Robin the following origination from TP1 
 Hey, I live like that. 
 hey buddy, would it be better to sell this on sonat or tenn?  The storage balance is 500,195 dth or about 16,135 dth per day. 
 On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.  Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?  thanks 
 We have the following Tenn disounts for the 22-26th  even though we may not use them.  Z0 to Carthage meter #010031 on k#2891  $.1022 plus fuel.  Any Z1 or Z0 point to Z6-Tewksbury on k#2891  $.3522 plus fuel. 
 Joann, is the Canajoharie volume for the Nov 13th still 23953? 
 Gerald, it looks like the gas I sold you on the Nov 13 did not get scheduled.  The volume was 2700 dth.  Still checking on the 9th. 
 Please order me a fan because I'm burning up over here. 
 We negotiated the following discounts on Tenn and TGT  Tenn - all discounts are for the 27th only.  Z0 to Kinder k#2891	$.1421 Z0 to Tewksbury (Z6) k#2891  $.35   Texas Gas - discounts apply from 26th-30th. SL Pool to Mamou k# T001886   $.0421 
 HEY, you didn't copy your brother and I think I may come down Saturday to go fishing.  What do you think about that? 
 very good and tastefull 
 Hey team!!  I'm back.  And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05, which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th.  Jim, I've updated my schedule for the gas flows on Florida.  Tallahassee sent me a schedule of what they show.  I'l like to compare that to what you have. 
 Just making sure eveyone gets this. 
 sold 10,000 for 5/24 at gas daily waha - $.05 which is $3.035  and 10,000 for 5/25 - 5/28 at gas daily waha - $.05

 Maybe, but I know you will check my work because you are a caring individual - I don't care what everyone else says about you. 
 Ok, I would like to go over a couple of things this afternoon if possible.  I'll try to come down for 30 min or so. 
 Hey thanks.  You are sweet.  Looks like that 5.25 was a great sale too. 
 Heads up.  Andy should be putting in a request to increase my volume on k#37877 to 38,500 
 Midland sent their volume request to Kevin Brady for the month of June 2002.  Should I forward this to Oxy?  Should I tell Midland to contact Oxy in the future? 
 Audrey is doing great.  Dad is doing good. Mom is fair.  She's still struggleing with the new Mom stuff.  Not quite the picture book story she had hoped for.  Can't just hop up and do what she wants anymore.  She's a big advocate for birth control now!! 
 man that's rude 
 I'm not sure which attorney to send this too but I'm sure this is Enron's CGLF space. 
 an analyst named denver platchy went to aquila the same time brad did, denver is still there, Susan Scott spoke to him yesterday, denver told Susan here yesterday that brad had not been in all week and that he thought brad was down a lot of money for the year [Germany, Chris]  Susan was on the West Desk.  yesterday was her last day, she's going to Paris to take language classes.

 I would prefer that you fix it.  Just come over when you are ready.  thanks 
 Was this the last day Tall tood the gas?  I bet so. 
 I didn't know that I was a subscriber to begin with but I would like to use this if we can keep it.  I don't need it, its just a convenience for me.  Let me know if we can keep it..  Thanks 
 Robin Barbe followed up with a phone call.  I've told Linda that this wouldn't be resolved until we resolve all of our Dominion issues.  AND I TELL HER THIS ABOUT ONCE A WEEK.  Please forward her to me in the future. 
 thanks and yes it is!!  another photo  http://www.growingfamily.com/webnursery/babypage_view.asp?URLID=0U0X1E7K6M 
 thanks buddy 
 i'm working thru my 188 emails, would you see if there are any invoice drafts for april 2002 for midland cogen please 
 <http://hometown.aol.com/trogg522/myhomepage/index/html>  Hey, I hope the web link above works.  It takes forever to respond when I log into Enron's email and hit reply. 
 does this mean the system was keeping track of my unofficial vacation? 
 I just found it.  Sorry about that.  I will probably be sending you several emails between now and Monday.  Thanks. 
 Just all outstanding unpaid amounts.  it mite be easier for me to just go through the file and not worry about the copies since we are on the same floor.  I just need you to tell me what is outstandind and what isn't. 
 I didn't send this yet and I have not spoken with Cinergy either.  Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please.  Also, the scheduling contact at TXU is David Avila, his number is 214-875-9792, his aol id is avila4404.  I gave David the upstream information.  He said that for the weekend the downstream k# is 1901.

 i don't have it.  I think Max Doner gets a copy from someone but I'm not sure who. 
 Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday, the 10th.  I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if possible.  Thanks. 
 this is looking good. 
 Actually, I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for.  I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk, can't be that many of them.  But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for. 
 I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil, I think.  Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers, or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers?  Thanks 
 Do you have the April CNR invoice file? 
 I have a problem keeping my cell phone battery charged up.  But, my pager still works so I'm wearing it if you guys need me.  My pager number is 877-498-5497.  Do not leave a voice message on it because I can't retrieve those.  Thanks 
 Let's try again. 
 Let's see if this works. 
 Mike, I'm faxing you official statements from the pipeline and I'm going to mail them to Theresa Vos. 
 http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pyang/flash/miniputt.swf 
 thanks 
 For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02. 
 I'm forcasting $30,000.00 to be paid to Reliant this Friday for the Tallahassee deal. 
 I was just looking at the confirm for April and I believe the pricing doesn't match up.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 I see there are some processsing charges for CGAS and CNR.  Who bills us for these charges?  I may need to add another column to my worksheet or at least at the payment amounts to the numbers. 
 Shelley verified receipt of our $10,000.00 payment o Reliant last Friday.  Thanks Shelley.  Our current cash balance with Reliant is $60,880.00. 
 http://www.elaw4enron.com/default.asp 
 The name sounds familiar but I don't know this guy.  He's over scheduling at El Paso.  Greg Stickline  713-420-6463.  Good luck and let me know how it turns out. 
 Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/2/02 at $3.51.  Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/3/02 at $3.36.  Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/4-6/02 at $3.18. 
 I'm good for $3 
 Nosir.  You are the man working on this FREAKY pipe. 
 Reliant should receive a payment of $10,000.00 today which will give us a cash balance of $60,820.00.  Have a good weekend. 
 I would bump up the cash payment to Reliant for next week.  I'm estimating $56,000.00.  I do expect it to come down some. 
 I also have imbalance statements that I have received in the mail that I will be sending to Theresa. 
 When: Thursday, May 09, 2002 11:00 AM-12:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
 Quetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would you check on that please sir?  Thanks. 
    One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.  He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.  With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!  Now, the Moral of the Story: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!  Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1. Free your heart from hatred. 2. Free your mind from worries. 3. Live simply. 4. Give more. 5. Expect less.  P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.  Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you. 
 But I'm going to try and keep it down to minimum.

Germany, Chris says: but we will see. Germany, Chris says: yeah but its a litte different.  i still think its pretty much my fault - what you and i went through and what Ingrid and I are going through.

Germany, Chris says: hey, maybe you could go to FPL in florida?  close to disney and beaches Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says: with my retention (assuming we get the $$$!) i might pay off bills and then get a job as a greeter at the wal-mart in conroe! Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says: are you in the retention pool? Germany, Chris says: Wooohooo, you must have a good retention. Germany, Chris says: i'm in the lipp pool, i think that's what they call it. Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says: do you think we'll see the $$$?

 You should have the email below in your inbox talking about the producers on CGAS.  Reply to the email below once you find out if you are able to use the producer's gas without maintaining a balance. 
 Works great.  Thanks. 
 Please add Robin Barbe to your distribution.  Robin, I glance at Phil's worksheet everyday since I generate most of the cash payments in our group.  thx 
   April prices Inside Ferc	Per Midland ANR LA		3.31		3.3125		Looks good Pepl		3.29		3.3345		appears high by about $.0245 but not way off. Trk Tx		3.28		3.28		Trunkline should be an average but this is great, our price would have been $3.305 Trk La		3.33		3.28 
 I am requesting a prepayment of $10,000.00 to be paid to Reliant for Friday May 3rd. 
  To my knowledge that capacity is still valid.  It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth.  Ruth, I had asked George Linder? at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times.  He never did anything with it. 
 Robin confirmed that we did receive the payment from CMS.  This is the amount we invoiced CMS or the Michcon storage gas.  Thanks Robin! 
 Thanks 
 FYI, just verified with Melissa that Reliant received $2,049,602.20 for the items listed below.  Thanks Melissa. 
 I've adjusted out weekly prepay to reliant down to $10,000.00 to go out on Friday.  I want Robin to go through the wire process once just in case I'm not here next week. 
 Would you let Phil and I know when you hear abuot CMS's payment please?  thanks 
 Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.  I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.  Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd.  Thanks 
 I just briefly told Ed what you and I discussed.  He doesn't seem to want any additional info.  I'll keep my notes of our conversation anyway.  thanks 
 Contact info at El Paso 
 Harry, I think we finally have everything done on our side.  Would you give me your phone number and address and we will mail you the GISB.  Thanks 
 Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.  I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers  - asking for Roger's phone number and title. 
 http://home.enron.com/subpoenas/pdfs/FERCIVApr232002.pdf   Scroll down and look at the list of names. 
 Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.  Thanks Melissa.  You should receive the following wires today. $683,835.20 for baseload gas on Trunkline (6,800 dth x 31 days x $3.244) $1,365,767.00 for baseload gas on Florida (13,000 dth x 31 days x $3.389)  Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.  Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.  Her number is 713-853-7177.  Thanks 
 4/30/02  8:25 AM - Janelle said they would send the money today. 
 I don't see you on MSN.  My time free's up after 9:00 in the morning.  Tallahassee has to call on the swing gas by then. 
 consider it tossed 
 Call me ASAP please.  My number is 713-853-4743 
 that sounds good to me, unless i hear from you in 30 min or so i'll toss what we have from them. 
 Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet.  Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday.  Is this something that we should continue to get? 
 Lets see if this works.  My response is down below in blue. 
 Buddy!!!    I'm still here and stll kicking.  You know I have a baby on the way.  Its due May 7th.  My woman is getting BIG!!  GOOD LORD!!  Enron is still going strong.  Looks like I'll be here for at least a year but you never know.  I bet you guys miss me too, calling up, asking dumb questions, falling off horses at the shipper meeting.  How's life for you? 
 Who did you talk to? 
 Hey you.  Two changes for me.  Home number is 713-527-0534 Mobile is 713-557-5095  thanks, pretty email too. 
 I don't know if you guys can pull up my file from the previous email.  Here it is again just in case. 
 I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.  According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.  1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice. 
 FYI  I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone.  I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois, she is the capacity release lady.  She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all. 
 OK, that's it.  NO VACATION FOR YOU! 
  Cute little bugger.  Scott Goodell said forget the Salt Lake City thing.  He said Suzanne is paving the way for him with Michael Cathey.  I don't know him. 
 U are here!!!!    LUcky me. 
 Jackie, just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May.  I'm not sure of the impact just yet but either I or Kathy Kelly will keep you posted.  Thanks. 
 yes maam.  GOOD LUCK!! 
 Perfect.  thanks 
 NOW THAT's WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR!!!!  Thanks Drew.  Ok, no more bad talk about Drew for the rest of the week.  Is today Friday?    just kidding 
 You bet. 
 Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.  Thanks 
 Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American  310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00  Goods and Services Tax  $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00  Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00  Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?

 nope, i think it looks real good with burns like that.  but when you see a low day come in we should probably sell a littel more for the next day. 
 Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/26//02 at $3.24  Also received a call from Jeff at Lone Star telling us to work a little harder at working off the imbalance. 
 I am requesting a prepayment of $45,000 to be paid to Reliant for Monday April 29th.  Priscilla, please bring me the wire request and I will get Ed and Susan to sign off on it.  Stephen, Drew,  who should I give the wire too and where are you located?  Thanks 
 Thanks for the invoices and the Tidelanders Chorus info.  You gave me Feb and Mar 2002.  Do you have the Dec 2001 and Jan 2002 invoices? 
 Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?  I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.  I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time. 
 Thanks 
 Yesterday David Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.  I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.  He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".  I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing.  Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".  Just like the old days. 
 Susan just called me and said she is the CAO for ENA and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests.  I didn't know. 
  I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.  Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.  Why wouldn't that be you instead?    [Germany, Chris] 
 Sold 10,.000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/25 at $3.29 
 Kevin is my hero. 
 Please read the note below from Jeff at Lone Star, it looks like we may need to be particular for May.  Of cause that would involve me knowing a little more about the pipeline. 
 filled internally with some guy whose name i can't remember, it was a southeast orig spot.  i went to lunch with jim taylor and malory ????, she knows you.  she is from coastal 
 do you have sabra's cell number? 
 Do you ever talk to Bob.  What is he doing?  I want to call and hassle him at home. 
 take me with you where ever you go. You de MAN 
 I wonder if that bigger volume is a gigajoule thing? 
 this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday   I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant  Tallahassee 	10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $1,106,700  MCV		6,800 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $752,556  I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.  I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit. 
 Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 1.  it is more conservative 2.  the difference is small 3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.  If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.  Thanks 
 Let Kevin know about any suspected unpathed deals and he will get all over it.  This guy is going to be my boss someday.

 Just faxed them. 
 I am doing the noms on this one.  thx 
 What is the status of the Dominion issue? Thanks 
 you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on.  it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it.  i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building.  oh well,  YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 good luck.  when is comes to daycares.  it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there.  another place you could look is   st. andrews presb.  at buffalo speedway and bissonet.  when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing.  it is or was an accredited facility. Barbe, Robin says: that facility really didn't have much of an academic program.  at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later,.  it better not to move kids alot. Barbe, Robin says: the lonestar pigging is tomorrow and i told kevin if something happens this afternoon to get with you 
 MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.  MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).  I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.  Please let me know.  Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?  I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here. 
 I'm moving my cash payment to Reliant to Friday.  Phil is going to give me new market values for Tallahassee and Midland tomorrow morning. 
 yeah i know.  i'm looking at that now. 
 Melissa Garner verified receipt of the $17,000.00 wire last Friday.  Thanks Melissa.  Our current cash balance with Reliant is $57,180.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow.  Thanks. 
 did you count the half day on 4/16 or all day on 4/19 or should we leave these as unofficial time? 
 I had the time of my life.  My only regret was not being able to spend more time with you.  thx for the invite.  i think my happy hour days are almost over. 
 Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37  Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.  Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions. 
 sounds good to me 
 When: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 11:30 AM-12:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: Sydney, Austrailia  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
 You might like to get this. 
 Rita,  I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December.  I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas.  I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future.  I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you.   Thanks 
 Kathy said some Mobil traders created National Energy And Trade after Mobil let go of a bunch of people.  I guess you know that both Molly and Chris worked for Mobil.  By the way I did the math on Sabra.  $400 x 7 months = $2,800.00  $3,733.33 / 75% = $3,733.33  $3,733.33 / 5% = $74,666.67 
 Thanks for the info.  I voted to get that sucker lowered to 45 and 10,000 of my closest friends are doing the same thing. 
 Good Morning!  I love taking Fridays off.  I see Kathy sold 10,000 dth for the weekend.  Let me know what you want to sell for tomorrow.  If I don't hear from you by 8:00 AM C.T.  I'll just sell 10,000 dth.  thanks 
 These are funny.  I thought it might be enron photos at first. 
 Kathy, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.  Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.  We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.  If it ever happens on the weekend, Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.  If I remember correctly, Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant.  Are we sill set up that way? 
 I've requested a $17,000.00 wire to be made tomorrow and we still have a cash balance of $54,820.00.  I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity.  Her number is 713-853-5858.  Thanks and have a good weekend. 
 PNM Gas Services was terminated on 12/7/01.  Same as the previous email where there are Trk Nom and Schd volumes in Unify but nothing in Sitara.        <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> 
 Deal 1035543, a sale to Giant Refining Company, was terminated effective 12/1/01.  It looks like the Trk Nom and Schd volumes should be taken out.      <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)> 
 i would just call oxy and ask them.  there's no sneaky stuff anymore and its not like we would send them their money back either. 
 I'm out tomorrow and Kathy Kelly will be backing me up.  Instructions for Kathy 1.  Call Mike to find out how much to sell for Sat-Mon. Mike's number 248-813-1063 Mike's cell number  248-345-4002  2.  Call Sabra Dinari or Jackie Adams at Cinergy and find out if the gas is coming in at the following 2 points. Meter #17-1436-00 Conger		10,000 dth per day Meter #17-1240-50 NNG Sprayberry	10,000 dth per day  Jackie Adams number is 713-393-6889  3.  Sell gas to TXU Energy.  Either Lynn Handlin at 214-875-9789 or Fran Russell at 214-875-9793. I believe Fran will be handling the TXU activity tomorrow.  I let TXU pick the points they want the gas.  Thx, call me on my cell if you have questions. 
 Ed was questioning the value of the Tallahasse deal due to the higher prices.  He said we should check into it.  I guess it doesn't matter now with the screen back down. 
 Larry and I have wires request for you and we don't know where you sit now.  Where are you? 
 My bunkmate, Troy, would like to speak to your cleaing person.  He's thinking about hiring someone to clean his apartment.  What do you think? 
 Opps, misspelled Cinergy. 
 I think I have access to everything now.  thanks 
 I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.  1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.  2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.  Just a thought. 
 yes i did.  Friday April 19th.  Well their we go, I've made my 1(00,000) mistake for the year and I'm all out.  Nothin' but perfection from now on. 
 not unless EES had some TCO storage we were not aware of.  They would be doing something with 620,000 if they were fooling with our stuff. 
 I am requesting a prepayment of $17,000 to be paid to Reliant for Friday April 18th.  Priscilla, let me know when you have the wire ready and I'll come get it OR you can leave it on my desk at ECN0604c.  Doug, are you still on 4 in the new building?: 
 if the counterpart is in cash disbursements then yes, if its an accountant in an operational area then they should know what its for. 
 Wooooooooooooooooooooohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 hey what does xoxo mean? 
 we knew we were moving yesterday but we though we would have our systems availabe till after lunch.  I was wrong.  We were working at 9:45, I stood up for something and the movers took my chair.  We had just lost our phones at that time too. 
 I didn't call to check on this but I've never seen an email like this from CGAS.  I just thought it was interesting. 
 We are still meeting for beverages this evening around 6ish, correct? 
 No wire for tomorrow since we are moving.  We will do a cash request tomorrow and send out a wire on Friday. 
  Our current cash balance is $54,820.00 AND we are moving back to the old building today so I've decided to wait until Friday to send a wire.  Thanks 
 OK then.  Don't forget about me.  Someday you are going to want me working over there.  I'm a jewel, and modest too. 
 I hope I have the right email address.  Let me know.

 My fault, I didn't see the Wed.  I admit it, I'm worthless. 
 I'm out but Kathy is probably going to be the chief on this anyway and I would just be her backup.  So you guys could probably meet without me.  FYI, I'm out all day Friday too.

 Deal		Counter party					Sitara Contract Comment 942720		California Energy Hub, SOCAL			96063621 this is an exchange deal.  California Energy Hub is not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Socal is but there  are no contract numbers listed.  The hedge on this deal was killed in Sitara on 1/8/02.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.10 x 310,000 dth per day, which may be incorrect.  Its possible that the volume should be 310,000 dth per MONTH.  773141		Central Illinois Light Company			96000389 No changes made to Sitara ticket since 5/4/01.  Per Master Letter Log - ENA cancelled the financial agreement due to Central's failure to pay.  No reference is made to the physical deal.  Per Sitara - this deal has a min and max volume.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day.  889014		Colorado Spring Utilities				96062701 No changes made to Sitara ticket since 6/29/01.  Per Master Letter Log - only activity with EPMI is listed, no mention of any contracts with ENA.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $7,200.00 per month.  22109		Consolidated Edison Company of New York	96000908 Long term sale to ConEd on Tennessee pipeline.  Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - the hedge in Sitara was killed on 11/26/01.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $101,339.35 which is a percentage of the Tenn Z1 and Z0 indexes.  1161432	Superior Natural Gas Company			96052897 Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - hedge in Sitara was killed on 12/12/01.  This is a sale to Superior with a NYMX trigger, the trigger was entered in Sitara on 11/6/01 at 14:32 and the trigger price was $3.05.  The March invoice is for the difference between the trigger price of $3.05 and Nx1 for March $2.388 = $.662 x 10,000 dth per day x 31 days.  1201382	TXU Fuel Company				96096343 This deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0. 
 Max, would you call Tiffanie Wheeler at Reliant to discuss the volume discrepancy on 2/27/02.  Her number is 713-207-6790.  I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee, they will adjust our bill.  Thanks.  Keep me posted. 
 She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

 Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice. 
 Melissa verified our payment on Friday so that makes our estimated current cash balance is $61,790.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow. 
 FYI 
 Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.  She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.  Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.  Thanks. 
 Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  Don't know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere. 
 Priscilla said Mid American just called her and said they won't pay us until they receive an invoice.  Have you pathed this yet?  Let me know.  thx

 Good morning!  Would you let me know if you received a wire from Enron on Friday april 12th please?  The amount was $22,000.00.  Thanks 
 No flying, my brother and I have a pontoon boat.  It has a potty on so I think it will work.  Next Wed it is. 
 I love you.  You are mine then for lunch on Wed.  We can discuss a place later. 
 nope and nope  Baby is due May 7th but my womand is HUGH and I don't think she's gonna make it.  Kathy just told me.  I'm happy for you.  Did you listen to the retention talk first or were you already out the door mentally?  I wanna do lunch with you.  When can you pencil me in?  I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday.

 I'll copy you, but it is Ponderosa sending out the bills correct? 
 I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details; Price:		$2.25 Volume:	1,121,702 Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1  Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC? 
 I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?  Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west. 
 Who and where are they located? 
 Judy is going to send you an email.  I don't know what they changed to. 
 Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system.  I've requested access to change the tickets.  I'll send a new email once I enter the deal.  Thanks  Let me know if you see any other missing items too. 
 Thanks 
 How much should we sell for Sat - Mon?  thx 
 Oh yeah, I'm looking good now.  I found some 5 year old "Tan in a Can" and spread it all over.  It caused a small rash in a couple of spots but I brushed those up in the photo. 
 Would you see if we sent out an invoice for deal 384258 to Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. for December 2001 and January 2002?   And if we did, did they pay it?  Thanks 
 http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ENA/livelink.exe?func=ll&objtype=141&objaction=browse  Let me know if this works. 
 You better believe it.  I'll bring my photos for the "magazine" shoot. 
 Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email. 
 I'll be taking off the 1/2 day next Tuesday April 16th and all day next Friday April 19th unless someone has pressing needs.  Kathy Kelly will be backing me up on all gas activity next Friday. 
 im an email mo fo.  whatever that means 
 Suzanne, give them Priscilla's number or my number.  Priscilla is at 713-345-3736 and my number is 713-853-4743.  thanks 
 When you get the price for the 10,000 dth we are selling you for Friday, would you send it via email.  I forward that info to 3 different people.  Thanks 
 Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.  We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.  Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.  Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.  My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file. 
 My girlfriend and I are having a baby soon.  The due date is May 7th.  I have some questions regarding what my insurance and benefit options are.  Would you tell me who I should speak with please?  Thanks Chris

 Do you see any payables to Elvis Energy? 
 Don't know about this but I am handling the activity for the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. (a.k.a. Cleburne Plant, a.k.a. Tenaska Power Partners) on Lone Star Pipeline.  We have a large imbalance on the transport contract that I'm slowly working off but that's about it.  Are you guys aware of any storage?  I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana.  I also have a contact at  Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first. 
 I'm not aware of anything like that.  I'll ask around. 
 Hey team.  I changed the wire date to Friday and I updated the MTM value on the cash request.  Ed signed the wire and its sitting on Doug's desk.  Thanks.

 I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.

 David is going to send us an email with as much information that he can remember regarding the storage contract on Dominion, including any lawyers EES worked with back in December. 
 I just got Iris's voicemail.  She is on vacation until tomorrow.  I'll give her a call in the morning. 
 You were on the phone when I came by so I left the TXU shipper imbalance statement in your inbox this morning before lunch.  This is for gas being delivered to the Cleburne plant. 
 Melissa just confirmed that Reliant received ENA's wire last Thursday.  Thanks Melissa.  Tallahassee requested 0 volumes for tomorrow so our current cash balance is $66,270.00.  Thanks. 
 This is the info I gave El Paso.  Its probably ok to use this. 
 anytime i say "jump" phil and larry say "HOW HIGH" which is the way it should be.  now, somebody fetch me a diet coke!! 
 Susan,  I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event.  CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi, Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.  Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend.  later chris 
 we've been trying to sell about 5000 of imbalance gas a day.  lone star is aware of it and approves. 
 ship it to the plant 
 I don't think I ever had the invoices.  All I had were the statments showing the balance in the park and loans. 
 we have been selling txu 10,000 day on lone star since the 1st.  for tomorrow we are selling them 6,000 instead of 10,000 
 I sold 6,000 dth to TXU at $3.18 for tomorrow. 
 Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham  Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word? 
 My last email on Sonat Park and Loan. 
 thanks 
 ahhh just like a woman.   although i have many of those sensitive feeling you know. 
 I got mine marked.  Thank you for inviting me you sweet sweet sweet person!!!!!!!!! 
 For tomorrow, should I wear a suit OR khaki's with a dress shirt OR khaki's with a dress shirt, tie and navy jacket?   This is my info for tomorrow.

 check on getting some gas medicine from the drug store, its over the counter stuff for babies. 
 I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.  Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.  Thanks  I'm taking off Friday. 
 FYI, MCV swing activity on Trunkline, not ANR.  Monday, March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas. 
 You are my hero buddy.  And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.  Hmmmm.   Take care and best of luck to you and the family. 
 The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 4th is $37,000.  I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk. 
 Our current cash balance after purchasing gas for the 4th is $43,350.  I've requested a prepayment of $37,000 to be wired tomorrow afternoon.  Have a good day! 
 ok 
 When she refinances, will your name be taken off the loan on the house? 
 Joe went to work for Bridgeline yesterday. 
 I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.  Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.  I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.  Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.  thx chris 
 Hey buddy, please include Kathy on you distribution in the future.  thanks 
 Hey, buddy.  I hope things are going well with you.  The pipeline is the place to be these days.  I appreciate the emails of the imbalance statement.  Would you send the hard copies to the following address please.  Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, LTD. C/O Enron North America Attn:  Theresa Vos ECN 1005 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX  77002  Just in case you need it.  Her number is 713-345-8173.   Thanks. 
 I walked to the park yesterday and didn't see you.  It was such a bummer.  Today is Eirc's last day, sniff sniff.  It was good seeing you.  Take care. 
 Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?  ?	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team. ?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.  Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.  Thanks 
 Got it.  Thanks 
 Beginning Wednesday, April 4th, El Paso will be taking 3,373 Dth per day from DRN #716, contract #101067.  El Paso will scheduling the gas on contract #5207.  Thanks everyone.  Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059 
 Let me know if you get this.  thanks 
 Probably not.  I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week. 
 They are starting on the 4th.  I thought I told him the 3rd but I may have made a mistake.  My fault.  Thanks 
 No buddy.  Thank you.  And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too.  My treat.  Maybe I'll invite my work wife, Judith.  I'm thinking about Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.  I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway. 
 I'll check on it.

 i cannnot make an upward eye roll, and i can't help if my eyes look beady all the time. 
 I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.  Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?  Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.  I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60. 
 I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year.  But, I still need a backup for the gas activity.  Unless you tell me to do something different, I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up. 
  ENA has an approximate cash balance of $58,000 with Reliant after purchasing the 2,000 dth for tomorrow.  Melissa verifed receipt of the $1.7 million wire made last Thursday.  THANKS MELISSA!!  Let me know if anyone has questions. 
 It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of? 
 Would you see if we sent out invoices our if someone at Enron requested that no invoices be sent out.  Thanks 
 Hey woman!!  How are things going?  Happy with the job?  Happy with the man?  Be carefull, something happened to my woman and she has a really big stomach. 
 I'm just glad you are working today.  Makes me feel good. 
 I'm LOOOOOKING!!!! 
 I don't see the upward eye roll that all women are so good at.  I can even see my daughter practicing it when I feed her. 
 You are a stud 
 What is our Dominion status? 
 I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.  Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?  Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash? maybe and trying to correct a few things.  I'm not sure what the process is now.  Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?  By the way team, Scott is out till next week. 
 FYI 
 Thanks.  You too!! 
 These are all the people I have been working with lately. 
 I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.  The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.  I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00. This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000). 
 Hi team.  Here is my new cell phone number, 832-867-3346.  I just changed it in People Finder so it may not show up until tomorrow. 
 Should I cancel the wire that is scheduled to go out today?  It might be too late but I can check. 
 I wonder if HR changed this holiday schedule over the last couple of months?  Let's ask Kathy, she will know. 
 I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.  Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.  This was just in case you had the same question. 
 Looks good to me.  First word of second para - Ever or Even? 
 I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.  Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00  Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00  Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract 10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00  Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00 
 I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion.  Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00  Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00  Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract 10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00 
 Will do.  Thanks for the info. 
 You are my hero.  I am going to have a 2 day backup plan just in case Dominion doesn't deliver any gas. 
 Done with these.  Is there another list?  I can't remember. 
 Louis Dicarlo said you should chat with Sara Shackleton about the Dominion ISDA agreement.  BUT you may already be doing that. 
 I'm keeping this file here ==> o:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/appalachain Producers

 3:30 at Ed's desk if fine.  thanks 
 I posted the April TW capacity.  11:50 AM  left a voicemail for Russell Williamson at BP Amoco  11:52 AM left a voicemail for Robert Eason at Burlington  Julie Reames is on maternity leave for 12 weeks . 
 Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.  This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.  Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair. 
 Barbara was going to tell you that I called.  I'm going to get my morning diet coke and I would like to see the name that lady gave us last night that might have some daycare info.  later gator jethro 
 http://homeadvisor.msn.com/pickaplace/comparecities.asp?TS=UT&selFS=TX&selTS=UT&selFC=0&selTC=0&PFC=Houston&PTC=San%20Francisco&EarningFromCity=50000&PFS=TX&PTS=CA 
 In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.  Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do. 
 I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).  I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.  When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?  We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.  I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that. 
 I will be increasing my prepays to Reliant this week to cover any swing activity on the MCV Trunkline deal.  I have changed the "est cash flow" tab in the Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow file. 
 I'm not sure.  9:12 AM - I left a message for Brian Lamb at Columbia Gulf. 
 FYI, ENA has (or had) about 50,930 of primary receipts at Venice. 
 I mean Susan.  I assume you are talking about Susan Pereira. 
 i took the test and this is what it said. colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard. You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure. Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being. You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'. You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them. Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.

 According to Kay Mann, Shemin may not be here until late afternoon. 
 This is what I heard,  Please type any anything significant that you might have heard and send it back to me.

 Prepayment and gas flow activity through Monday March 26th.  I have added 2 new members to the team, welcome Melissa and Sheeley.  Feel free to hit Jim Taylor up for a free lunch. 
 I just deleted something you emailed me on March 20th or 21st.  I think it might have been related to Columbia gas but I'm not sure. 
 Prepay for Dominion for April 2002 to be made on Friday, March 29th.  I printed out the attached form and gave it to Doug Sewell.  Prepay amount = 10,000 dth per day x 30 days x $2.1562 = $646,860.00 
 The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.  For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."  The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."  Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."  Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them. 
 Ruth, use this as a starting point for the payment to Tennessee.  Make sure you copy Magaret Dhont and Rita Wynne on this. 
 I will be available by 9:05 AM.  I have to buy gas around 9 am every morning. 
 I am releasing the Boston Gas capacity on Iroquois (k#125008) and Tennessee (k#29667) for April to Boston Gas.  I am releasing the capacity prearranged, subject to bid, minimum bid of 100% of max rate with Boston Gas as the prearranged bidder.  Bidding will end on Monday, March 25th.  Submitted Iroq offer #50169 on 3/21/02 Submitted Tenn offer #29667-6 on 3/21/02 
 With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go.  No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.  Ed 
 I think you will be happy with me.  I believe I was able to release the capacity for April under offer #50169. 
 thx, looks like its working.  it probably already worked.  i just forgot to use the icon you set up for me.  i'll send you another nasty email next month. 
   Greg We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas.  Thanks  Chris L. Germany Manager, Gas Trading Phone 713-853-4743 Fax  713-646-3059

 I can't believe it.  I'm having the same trouble again this month.  I use this board about twice a month. 
 I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is.  But I do go to this website on the internet ==>    http://escript.dom.com/  to access the Dominion EBB.  Dominion used to be called CNG. 
 I have confirm letters on my desk.  Should I send those to you? 
 I have an event that I need to attend tomorrow afternoon so I will be taking the half a day off starting at lunchtime.  I will send out a plan of action for Trunkline this afternoon.  IF anyone needs me you can page me at 877-498-5497 BUT do not leave a voicemail, I don't know how to retrieve them. 
 Sure.  I have one gas purchase that I make right before 9:00 AM every morning but I can be there at 9:05 AM or later. 
 ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.  Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.  Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation. 
 Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.  We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.  I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts. 
 I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;  Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment 1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved 1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved 1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved 1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan. 1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved 1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.  I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.  Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes. 
 You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.  Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.  I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.  Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.  Can you help get me access? 
     It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does for a  living.  The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."  The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."  Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease dancer in a cabaret for gay men."  The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said, "I'm sorry but my dad is an  1) auditor for Arthur Andersen  OR  2) a trader for Enron   and I was just too embarrassed to say so." 
 actually, could you or Kathryn send Shemin 5 Dominion producer contracts.  Just any 5 will do.  She just wants to get a feel for what these contracts look like. 
 Cool. 
 Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.  I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office. 
 I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00 or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some of those letters you are talking about down below.  Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.  Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can decide if you want to come.  Thanks 
 My Tenn emails from way back. 
 I have requested a wire to Reliant for Thursday in the amount of $30,000.00.  Thanks. 
 WOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,   Daddy's getting a new Blue Wave Bay boat!!!!   WOOOHOOOO 
 Prepay amount for tomorrow is $30,000.00.  I gave Doug the hard copy of the wire request.  Thanks team. 
 Another interesting item.  Call me when you get a chance. 
 I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account.  I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid.  They said before Dec 2nd.  I told them they should cancel the service.  Don't know if they are going to do that or not.  8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless, this account has been cancelled. 
 Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.  Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.  Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.  Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation. 
 This has not been a good informative day.  We just need to chat with Dominion to figure out how the contracts work and for me to find out more info the storage contracts. 
 Max, I forgot all about you needing this.  I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days. This is what I have done so far. 
 Where are you located?  I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union. 
 Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails.  I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us.  We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available.  I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all. 
 stacy.dickson@enron.com  Thanks 
 Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.  Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.  Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?  Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?  thx 
 I need to get copies of all the invoices for Dominion for ENA, VNG, and EES for Nov-01 through current please.    thanks chris x3-4743 Fax 713-646

 Ok, put me down for 4 Chic Fil A's ($20.00). 
 Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition. 2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.  I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following. 1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket. 2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition. 3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.  Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.  Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.  Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.   3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of 11/30/01	12/31/01 Gath North		1,323		2,187 Tran North		0		0 Gath South		(26,482)		31,583 Tran South		5,412		8,143  Cumulative		(19,747)		41,913   Dominion IF Prices Mar 2002	$2.59 Feb 2002	$2.20 Jan 2002	$2.79 Dec 2001	$2.42 Nov 2001	$3.37 Oct 2001	$2.02 Sep 2001	$2.42 
 Thanks Max.  Per our discussion today I requested 64,000 dth per day from Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc.  I spoke with Carl Haugneland and I faxed him a copy of the attached letter and excel worksheet.  Joe, I am mailing a copy of the letter with attachments to you.  Thanks. 
 thx buddy 
 Hey buddy.  I'm going to another meeting.  Don't forget to send me the worksheet.  Thanks 
 Mark is our "hired" special bankruptcy attorney who works on transportation and storage.  Enron goes to him to get expertise on how to handle the pipeline contracts.  Shemin Proctor is like an Enron staff attorney specializing in transport. 
 Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,  1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth) 2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth 3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1) 4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.  Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.  Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did. 
 3/14/02 9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas. 
 sorry, not till i hear from legal but we probably won't pay the invoice.  as of right now, don't pay the invoice. 
 nope 
 Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.  I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.  Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.  Have a good weekend! 
 Do you still chat with Nelson?  GO BUDDY GO!

 Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.  ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;  1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424. 2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok? 3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat. 4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).  Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.  All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.   Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.    2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.  Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.  Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.  Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.  2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.  2/25/02 Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract. 1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.  3/11/02 Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.  3/13/02 Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream. 3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out. 3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to h
