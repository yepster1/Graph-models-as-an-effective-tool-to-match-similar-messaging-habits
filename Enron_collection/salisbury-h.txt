 Hello,  I need one ticket to Las Vegas leaving on Friday 4/20 and returning Sunday 4/22.  I have a ticket reserved through my travel agent leaving Portland at 4:20pm and returning on Sunday at 12:30pm.  I reserved this yesterday as the spaces seemed to be filling up.  The price on this is $550 round trip.  My only need is to be back Sunday on an early flight.  I can hold this ticket for a few days.  Let me know if you can do better on the price and I will cancel the reservation.  If not let me know and I will book it.  Thanks, Holden

 I have updated the deal numbers 727040 and 737214 to how I think it should be valued.  When it comes down to it the differential will probably not be that large.  Let me know what the difference is now.  Thanks, Holden 
 This information is in eHRonline.  Thank You, Holden 
 I would like for this product to trade for Sunday and Monday together.  It would be like the Sunday-Monday light load product that now exists except we are stripping out the HE 7-22 on Sunday.  Therefore I would like to include the non-holiday Monday.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also, any word on the Pinnacle Peak delivery point?  We do not need to provide a bus as this is a common delivery point.  Thank You, Holden 
 Brian McClellan is speaking to Tarcy about this and is getting back to me.  He seems to think that Tarcy will insist that they cannot change the price.  I don't want to pay this.  Thanks 
 Thanks 
 The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system. 
 Here are the purchases we are making for the balance of January. 
 I used this option at Craig today for Monday.  I am leaving the office today early and have not yet input the deal as we are waiting to put it into the Rockies book.  The schedule for 10/8/01 is as follows:  HE 11 - 10mws HE 12-14  -  25mws  That is it.  We are currently out by this amount at Craig in the postion manager.  Let Tom or Mark know if you have any questions, or call me.  Thank You, Holden 
 805315 805316 805317 794237  These were all out trades that offset each other and were never put into the system.  Thanks, Holden 
 ok 
 I have not received a credit for this charge on my Amex.  How can I follow up on this.  Thanks, Holden 
 I have input the emergency contact information into the system.  My home phone number was in the system.  Thank You, Holden 
 794237  thanks 
 I would like two.  Thank You, Holden 
 yes,  thanks 
 These look good.  Thank You, Holden 
 We delivered to Valley through 12/06/01.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thank you, Holden 
 I have noticed that your seven day forecast has not been updated for several days.  Thank You 
 Anna,  I never received an intinerary for my hotels.  Thank you 
 2 are children  thanks 
  deal numbers for this were 602738 and 602737 
 I changed it.  Thanks 
 I would like this report.  Thank you, Holden 
 Montrose as well. 
 Anna,  I will also be traveling to Colorado on this trip.  Let me know if I can schedule this through you since you know the details or if I should talk to someone else.  Thanks, Holden 
 This is everything for the Southwest Desk.  The only difference is that deal # 528030 is for 50mws and deal # 705583 is RTC.  Thanks, Holden 
 $2.84 is right, I changed it.  Thanks 
 yes 
 I would never do that.  That transmission is not mine.  The only Nevada tranny that I used that day is Enpowered under #'s 702461 abd 704751.  Thanks 
 It seems that PNM is charging an unreasonable amount for losses.  Is there any way we could address this.  Thanks, Holden

 Hello,  I am trading for Enron West Power and am curious if we are set up to view your trading screens.  If so what is the login procedure and if not what is required to do so.  Thank You, Holden 
 Here are the purchases we made for next week.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Holden 
 So how should these deals be Enpowered in the future?  Cara has wisely warned me not to Enpower multiple strips to avoid this double counting. 
 $35 is correct, I changed it.  Thanks 
 Here are my goals.   Thanks 
 Here is a resume from an aquaintance.  He is interested in an IT position and seems like a good candidate.  Not sure if you are hiring but I believe he is available.  Thank You 
 $51 is the right price.  The deal has been changed.  Thanks 
 I would like to attend.  Thank You 
 LD Mirant for the loss of revenue due to cutting the schedule.  As long as we are kept whole financially then there should not be an issue.  Please let me know if you need any more info.  I assume that you will do the annuity but let me know if you want me to.  Thanks, Holden 
 I have purchased 11mw of firm monthly transmission from Mead 230 to West Wing 500.  The enpower deal number is 671184 and the oasis number is 21397.
