 Yes 
 I really think Jeff is a bad choice - let's discuss. 
 Read some of Richard's questions 
 We still haven't got this finalized - I'm  looking to do this this week otherwise I would have to start agreeing with Bill that we have to pull them.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Is Smurfitt the deal you lost last Friday? 
 No problem - good luck 
 Kal  Could you please send Cathy a guest user id and password for EnronOnline.  Please set it up with defaults so she can see some products.  Thanks  Louise    Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.  You should also have had a voicemail from John.  See you when you get back.  Let's also talk about your contract when you're back. 
 Apologies Abigail  - sent to you by mistake 
 I was sort of assuming Sally would bring this with her to the meeting. Am I wrong? 
 Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much. 
 What would be the cost of moving etc - all the new infrastructure etc.  When you say cheaper what do you mean - all in including moving etc.  We obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move. 
 I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.  Thanks  Louise 
 on fuel cells - please set it up and ask Duran  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 terminated as long as we can ie there has been a PIP in place etc but as usual things are slow. She refuses to take a director position - if you ask me she is posturing and will resign for another job shortly - I think she is looking for a payoff.

 We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.  By the way - give me a date and I'll be in Chicago.

  A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.  Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  1) Access new markets and customers In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  2) Manage high volume of products and transactions Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.  To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.  3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line  EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives.  Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

 Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?  Louise 
 That's fine - I;m back in tomorrow 
 Aha, could you provide a column including the approver.  Thanks  Louise 
 I thought any 'Contractors' had a zero limit which must be the case.  We have Kathy Abshire buying things and she is a contractor.  Please could you check that contractors and temps have a zero limit. 
 The view is that the CapEx  hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.  Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real. 
  Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. Video You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet). Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. John & Louise

 Yes but no counterparty names.  Jay has it all. 
 Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though. 
 3 & 4 are better than where we are now.  The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.  The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building. 
 Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).  Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).  Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.  Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day. 
 As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.  Thanks 
 Can you make sure Marcus Nettelton has three screens.  One pc and two screens.  Thanks  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Simply  People, systems and floor space.  Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters. 
 Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster  Hello  I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency. I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.  Thanks  Louise 
 Give Chris Calger a ring if you are serious.  I hope you're not. 
 Agreed 
 I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.  Will your people mopve to Houston? 
 I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.  I am contatable on 07778757656.  Thanks  Louise 
 Don't worry - you're not supposed to let go while I'm away.  Speak to you later  Cell number 713 530 0838 or 011447778757656 
 Tammie    Please could you set up the meetings (apart from the Thursday one which UBS already has arranged.  Contact Dave Forster and co-ordinate with him.  I couldn't forward you the email I sent but it was just to the 8 commercial MDs in UBSWEnergy.  Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails.  Thanks  Louise 
 Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy.  Tammie will co-ordinate dial ins etc 
 Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.  As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.  Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.  Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York. 
 Big - a whole floor with no pillars.  Got to be the most expensive place in the world to live. 
 We'll see you at about 4pm is that ok?  On cell 07778757656 - flying tonight. 
 Oxley - shouldn't think its a problem I mentioned it on Friday.  David please sort out - if there is difficulty contact Pat 
 Love it

 Prepays - although they do not terminate they do drop to zero collateral on a further downgrade. 
 2. Cancel  Thanks  PRC is something we should do all in one day.  I'll let you know. Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps. 
 What is the number?  I am very worried that you are sending a negative message on Enron out of the building. 
 It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.  I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us 
 Ray  Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.  Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.  The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.  Thanks  :Louise 
 Let's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.  Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.  Louise

 Not going well 
 Please update daily 
 I need a two bedroom 
 Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution.

 Enron Management Committee  I hereby resign from the above mentioned committee. 
 Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.   As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.  This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:  1.	Transitional Steering Committee: This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002. Committee Members: Mike Hutchins (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Louise Kitchen Pat O'Donnell Mike Bolin Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only. Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST  2.	Integration Committee: This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mark Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com UBS counterparties Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate. Time - Thursday 9:00am CST  3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee: This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.  Proposed Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Tim Belden Chris Calger John Lavorato Kevin Presto Hunter Shively Rob Milnthorp Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required. ?Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.  Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.  3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mike Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 8:00am CST  3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen Bryan Murtaugh - UBS Legal Mark Taylor Elizabeth Sager/Leslie Hansen Mary Cook/Jeff Hodge Bill Glass Bill Bradford Peter Keohane Barry Tycholiz Frank Vickers Laura Luce Rob Milnthorp Chris Calger David Forster Other members to be announced Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 10:00am CST  Tammie will notify each of you of the rooms etc.

 Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.  Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders. 
 I meant rogue finance guys!! 
 You need to stay - I am trying to get us sold. 
    The same here now 
 Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.  Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.  I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.  If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.  Take care & I will keep in touch.  Louise 
 Have them delivered to Jim Derrick and explain that they are Fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office. I don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now. Thanks   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 I left you on Portland for now but obviously when we announce the strucutre it will change.  Duran does know though. 
 We do need a list tomorrow morning.  I am still in meetings.  Is is possible to email me questions.

 This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.  A great reflection on you guys too.  Louise   Ref: Houston Chronicle website * * * * * Tuesday, Dec. 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. * * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

 In the interests of full communication - here's an email I sent to EOL.  It's only a comment not a direction for Jay or anything - but it was a pretty sad read for me. 
 you are been estalked! 
 Any time tomorrow morning possible? 
 Give me a ring when you are on your way. 
 Thanks for working on this - I appreciate it.  Louise 
 I did 
 Let's get some time tomorrow.  Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.  Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too. 
 Shouldn't we have let this group go?  Why are we retaining them?

 I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.  Can we discuss?  Thanks 
 I can send you people.  Jay Webb and Jenny Rub can do the rest.

 Ohoh  its all gone to ratshit! 
 What does that mean? 
 Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.  Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each. It works - we have enough people to do it.  In terms of the Estate: The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.  In terms of NewCo: EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

 Dear Linda  I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.  I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.  I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.  I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.  Regards  Louise Kitchen

 Message understood - we will try and accomodate Derek  Have a good week-end. 
  We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.  Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.  Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.  The meeting will be in John's office.  Thanks  Louise

 Just a couple of suggested changes to both.  There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.   On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.  Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?  Thanks  Louise

 Excellent 
 Good news - let's focus on getting the data this afternoon when we know the winner. 
 This amused me this morning!  Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"  The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies, "Okay."  The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,  "You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."  The shepherd answers,  "That's correct, you can have your sheep."  The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks,  "If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man answers, "Yes, why not?"  The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."  "How did you know?" asks the young man.  "Very simple," answers the shepherd.  "First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?" 
 Can we have them until we move?  That would probably be the easiest time to give them up. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld

 Current costs.  In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.  Gets us around the $200mm mark. 
 50% or less of the current group.   We have a market of 1 year = $x, so we'll need more cash for less people.   We may need our spare cash to fund the $12mm for the back office etc. 
  A bit of light entertainment!!     (See attached file: DoubleTree Show.ppt)     - DoubleTree Show.ppt

 How is it going -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld 
 Its the old NGL group.  I presume propane, butane etc 
  Expensed them. 
 Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.  My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.  Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone. 
 I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.  The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.  Thanks for your late and long hours.  Louise 
 issue 
  No  No 
 Any clue on numbers yet?  Top's support people are ringing our guys and telling them they want more people (legal)!  Bit of an issue when we'll be cutting.

 Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning. 
 No and no assurance should be given.

 Please get this printed - it is not formatted at the moment

 Ok great thanks

 Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.  Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.  In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.  Thanks  Louise 
 Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.

 Issue keeps coming up - Disaster Recovery There is no number in our budget for Disaster Recovery either space or systems - big expense. 
 Recognize the truck????? 
 Pat  For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.  Hope this helps.

 What's your address? 
 Solarc is the system used for NGLs etc - we do not plan to convey it into NetCo.    In terms of the court case - the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy.  They did try and prevent the whole NetCo thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it. 
 Absolutely - thanks 
 Its an IT security issue - ask Jenny or Bob what they think the plans are - it would be better if we were near peole. 
 I had presumed it got transferred - Wes could you please sort. 
 I sent you all your birthday stuff a day earlier just in case we lose our email for a day if it is taken down to be cleared.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Anne  We need these for Netco - is it too late? 
 Don't know!!! 
 It is going to be really difficult to do the split, eg the EnronOnline patent is moving, can we take all of the history of  concerning that which is on drives etc 
 Unless I am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal, does this mean we can do without this.

 Where does this patent reside - in the Estate or NetCo? 
 I was envisaging something like the one talked about for Canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time.  Netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in Feb and March where the majority of the value is for this contract. 
   Where do we get the headcount room from? 
 Bob  Superb  Would you mind adding responsibility names to each.  Thanks  Louise

 Needs Duran alteration 
 Harry/Jay, can you help come to some conclusion on this. 
 Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.  Take care  Louise

 Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.  Contracts Structure  There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.   PassWord Application (PA)  The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline.  We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.   Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)  The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.   General Terms and Conditions (GTC)  To be sent when the Buyer is known. When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc.  Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

 EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very
