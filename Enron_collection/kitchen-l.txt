 Yes 
 I really think Jeff is a bad choice - let's discuss. 
 Read some of Richard's questions 
 We still haven't got this finalized - I'm  looking to do this this week otherwise I would have to start agreeing with Bill that we have to pull them.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Is Smurfitt the deal you lost last Friday? 
 No problem - good luck 
 Kal  Could you please send Cathy a guest user id and password for EnronOnline.  Please set it up with defaults so she can see some products.  Thanks  Louise    Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.  You should also have had a voicemail from John.  See you when you get back.  Let's also talk about your contract when you're back. 
 Apologies Abigail  - sent to you by mistake 
 I was sort of assuming Sally would bring this with her to the meeting. Am I wrong? 
 Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much. 
 What would be the cost of moving etc - all the new infrastructure etc.  When you say cheaper what do you mean - all in including moving etc.  We obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move. 
 I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.  Thanks  Louise 
 on fuel cells - please set it up and ask Duran  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 terminated as long as we can ie there has been a PIP in place etc but as usual things are slow. She refuses to take a director position - if you ask me she is posturing and will resign for another job shortly - I think she is looking for a payoff.

 We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.  By the way - give me a date and I'll be in Chicago.

  A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.  Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  1) Access new markets and customers In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  2) Manage high volume of products and transactions Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.  To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.  3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line  EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives.  Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

 Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?  Louise 
 That's fine - I;m back in tomorrow 
 Aha, could you provide a column including the approver.  Thanks  Louise 
 I thought any 'Contractors' had a zero limit which must be the case.  We have Kathy Abshire buying things and she is a contractor.  Please could you check that contractors and temps have a zero limit. 
 The view is that the CapEx  hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.  Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real. 
  Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. Video You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet). Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. John & Louise

 Yes but no counterparty names.  Jay has it all. 
 Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though. 
 3 & 4 are better than where we are now.  The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.  The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building. 
 Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).  Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).  Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.  Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day. 
 As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.  Thanks 
 Can you make sure Marcus Nettelton has three screens.  One pc and two screens.  Thanks  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Simply  People, systems and floor space.  Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters. 
 Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster  Hello  I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency. I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.  Thanks  Louise 
 Give Chris Calger a ring if you are serious.  I hope you're not. 
 Agreed 
 I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.  Will your people mopve to Houston? 
 I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.  I am contatable on 07778757656.  Thanks  Louise 
 Don't worry - you're not supposed to let go while I'm away.  Speak to you later  Cell number 713 530 0838 or 011447778757656 
 Tammie    Please could you set up the meetings (apart from the Thursday one which UBS already has arranged.  Contact Dave Forster and co-ordinate with him.  I couldn't forward you the email I sent but it was just to the 8 commercial MDs in UBSWEnergy.  Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails.  Thanks  Louise 
 Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy.  Tammie will co-ordinate dial ins etc 
 Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.  As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.  Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.  Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York. 
 Big - a whole floor with no pillars.  Got to be the most expensive place in the world to live. 
 We'll see you at about 4pm is that ok?  On cell 07778757656 - flying tonight. 
 Oxley - shouldn't think its a problem I mentioned it on Friday.  David please sort out - if there is difficulty contact Pat 
 Love it

 Prepays - although they do not terminate they do drop to zero collateral on a further downgrade. 
 2. Cancel  Thanks  PRC is something we should do all in one day.  I'll let you know. Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps. 
 What is the number?  I am very worried that you are sending a negative message on Enron out of the building. 
 It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.  I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us 
 Ray  Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.  Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.  The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.  Thanks  :Louise 
 Let's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.  Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.  Louise

 Not going well 
 Please update daily 
 I need a two bedroom 
 Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution. 
 Not included in the schedule is the $300mm of LCs expiring on 11/30.  Just so you know - but I think the decision is obvious.

 Enron Management Committee  I hereby resign from the above mentioned committee. 
 Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.   As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.  This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:  1.	Transitional Steering Committee: This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002. Committee Members: Mike Hutchins (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Louise Kitchen Pat O'Donnell Mike Bolin Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only. Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST  2.	Integration Committee: This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mark Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com UBS counterparties Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate. Time - Thursday 9:00am CST  3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee: This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.  Proposed Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Tim Belden Chris Calger John Lavorato Kevin Presto Hunter Shively Rob Milnthorp Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required. ?Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.  Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.  3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mike Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 8:00am CST  3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen Bryan Murtaugh - UBS Legal Mark Taylor Elizabeth Sager/Leslie Hansen Mary Cook/Jeff Hodge Bill Glass Bill Bradford Peter Keohane Barry Tycholiz Frank Vickers Laura Luce Rob Milnthorp Chris Calger David Forster Other members to be announced Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.
