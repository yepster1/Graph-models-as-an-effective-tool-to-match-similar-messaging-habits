There's no one universal yes or no answer. Government support for this-or-that investment must be decided on a case-by-case basis, and consists of more than just support for individual businesses, but also infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

If an investment resulting in a (present value of a) dollar more in interest is likely to return more than a (PV of a) dollar in revenue and more than a (PV of a) dollar in net economic activity it should be seriously considered. That's the whole reason we measure the economic health of a government in terms of debt-to-GDP ratios.

Of course the trick is to invest wisely and not get distracted by shiny promises that aren't likely to be fulfilled but which will generate spiffy headlines. Bombardier, for instance, has had a very poor track record of late (no pun intended).'Traditional hunting' is not carried out in sufficient volumes to feed the entire population of the north. I suggest it is unfair to simply order them to become self-reliant after decades of food shipments from the south.&gt;1) Government cannot control interest rates. They can increase, putting pressure on this calculation.

Hence the use of the present value calculation (which would naturally include conservative estimates in interest rate growth) to mitigate this risk.

&gt;2) Interest rates compound. So the growth of economic activity needs to grow not just linearly post-investment, but at a rate that matches the compounding interest costs. This isn't a 'guarantee' just from building something. We need smart investments.

To a point. Once your horizon extends more than a few decades out the impact on the PV becomes immaterial regardless of what happens.

&gt;3) The Liberals have not made a business case for how their investments will lead to growth. What if it doesn't? Then we're in a really tough situation.

Given the relatively small amounts involved we will be marginally worse off if all of their investments fail. 

- Canada's interest-bearing debt is [~$900B] (http://www.fin.gc.ca/afr-rfa/2015/report-rapport-eng.asp#toc5). 
- Public debt charges in 2014-2015 were [$26.6B] (http://www.fin.gc.ca/afr-rfa/2015/report-rapport-eng.asp#toc3).
- The Liberals are planning to run deficits for 3 years totaling [$25.1B] (http://www.liberal.ca/costing-plan/) (ignoring the $1B surplus planned for year 4).
- If you dumped *all of the Liberals 3 years of deficits* onto the 2014-2015 debt, public debt charges would be ~$27.3B, or $714M higher. Unpleasant, but not a crippling burden even if interest rates went up.
I doubt it has much to do with the formation of our industries and more to do with our propensity to sell off our world leaders before they become dominant or watch them go bust. 

Blackberry and Bombardier have made bad business decisions (and faced fierce competitors / changing market conditions) to land them where they are today.&gt;But I don't think we should pay people to live in the North. If they can't afford it, they should move.

Life in the North would not be possible but for a handful of people living off the land without [Territorial Formula Financing] (http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/tff-eng.asp). Your proposal would require either:

- Taxation levels approaching or beyond 100%
- A complete shutdown of all public services, including health care
- Near-total evacuation of the North

Self-reliance is an admirable goal and one we should work towards. Potential solutions in this direction include expanding the [Northern Greenhouse Initiative] (http://www.cannor.gc.ca/eng/1409326765947/1409326828119) to increase (healthy) food production in the North.

Just cutting off all subsidies on principle and telling those who can't survive as a result to 'move' seems unnecessarily cruel.&gt;Make it gradual so they have time to adjust. But increasing funding is going in the wrong direction.

Putting aside the (very real) moral arguments of having built these communities on taxpayer funding only to pull it out from under them for our own short-term self-interest, there is no better way to announce to the world that we really have no interest in sovereignty over our north than by literally abandoning it over [$3.8 billion per annum] (http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp).The idea that our arctic sovereignty is somehow immutable seems a little unlikely. Depopulating the region to the minimal levels of subsistence hunters makes our claim on the region far more tenuous. And again, that's *just* the self-interested argument.A few military bases? In an area where we've removed any sort of logistical support by depopulating all of the communities?

Now we aren't saving much money, are we? We're just killing off what economic activity occurs in the north - [$9.3 billion dollars in 2013] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/econ15-eng.htm) - *and* now we've incurred a big fat bill to maintain military bases in the middle of nowhere.

That doesn't seem especially fiscally wise.I would say it depends on how many. Fewer than 10 and I don't see it happening. 10-15 and it becomes a strong possibility. More than 15 and it seems increasingly probable.

Maybe Brian Topp would snag the post as Nathan Cullen would be a little damaged by any loss. In any circumstance there would be a crisis as to whether or not to go more centrist or shift leftward.Here is a review of WOW Air from when they offered $99 flights from Boston to Iceland. [Read for yourself] (http://thepointsguy.com/2015/05/wow-air-review/). Highlights:

- There is of course a checked baggage fee (the reviewer paid $48 for one bag weighing 20kg one way / $96 round-trip), as well as fees for carry-on over 5kg ($29 for 7 extra kg, anything higher requires a checked bag fee)
- Easy-to-navigate online booking.
- Upcharges everywhere. "Like other low-cost airlines, WOW bolsters its revenue by charging extra fees for baggage, seat selection and a variety of in-flight services."
- "The planes themselves were clean, trendy and pretty darn comfortable, but you should still prepare yourself for a truly no-frills flight. Aside from the perks of the plane\u2019s cushy seats, whimsical decor and friendly staff, you should be ready to take out your wallet for just about everything."
- You can purchase seats with extra legroom for $33 one-way.
- No in-flight entertainment or wi-fi.
- "All in all, I was extremely satisfied with the service I received on both of my flights. The flight attendants, dressed in classy pink-purple outfits, always smiled when answering my questions about the sometimes-confusing fees, and upon arrival at KEF, were more than happy to help me navigate around the airport."

Seems like a reasonably decent airline if you don't mind a totally no-frills experience and are traveling light.

EDIT: Here is a [second review] (http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2015/05/11/trip-report-wow-air-boston-to-iceland/):

- "As a real low cost carrier, there is nothing free on board from the water to snacks. They take credit cards but not debit cards."
- "All in all, a very easy trip and I would definitely fly WOW again at the right price after factoring in all the extras."I'm not really someone who would call themselves a 'Liberal supporter' but there was [an election] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_election,_2013) that resulted in him winning the leadership. Whether or not you agree with him being a candidate it wasn't 'given' to him.Could you rephrase it, then? You did use the term 'given'. I assume you're unhappy that he won the leadership election?

As long as the process was fair, open, and democratic why would anyone be upset? The Liberals chose their leader and the general electorate will pass their judgment on the wisdom of their decision in a few weeks.- When you drop a military base in a far-off land with no local support infrastructure there are huge costs associated with it that the 'free market' cannot magically solve. Everything on that base will cost exponentially more, from power to supplies to pay for isolated personnel. Forget the language of 'subsidies', the raw dollar cost will be just as high.
- The absolute best way to assert sovereignty over a place is to populate it.
- It is categorically unfair to characterize the residents of the north as 'welfare recipients'.

You are advocating an extreme 'solution' to a non-issue that will create both an immediate and long-term risk to Canada and have negative economic consequences. I seriously question how you have arrived at these conclusions. I have provided ample statistics to back my argument and ask that you back yours with something more than your own opinion. &gt;Why wouldn't it be able to solve the problem?

Free market forces cannot teleport supplies to arctic bases for the equivalent costs to those in the south.

&gt;It would be populated with military bases.

Which generate limited economic activity or government revenue as compared to the current GDP of the territories, so you're pushing expenses up at the same time you're gutting revenue.

&gt;If they receive welfare, they are welfare recipients.

Ideological malarky. Virtually every resident of Canada qualifies by that measure.

&gt;I don't see how the military bases would necessarily cost more than the subsidies. I never said how many military bases. Maybe it would be just one with ten people. Maybe it would be a hundred.

That's your solution to defending arctic sovereignty? And now the free market will scramble to deliver cost savings for a far-flung base of 10-100 people?

&gt;But it seems safe to assume that if you give a few people some guns and pay them to be up there and stand watch, that you could do with far fewer people and that it would be cheaper. One guy with a gun is probably worth twenty without a gun and he probably wouldn't need to twenty times the resources.

Why bother when we [already do that] (http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/canadian-rangers/index.page)?

You have yet to back your argument with anything but your own opinion.I'm only saying that it might be in any scenario where the NDP suffers a loss bad enough that Mulcair leaves the leadership. Total conjecture on my part.EA also gave away a one of a choice Origin games [as an apology] (http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/03/18/ea-reveals-free-simcity-apology-games). This is just going in circles. You're ignoring the massive costs of relocation and rehousing (or condemning people to utter ruin by making them fund it themselves) and, of course, any sense of morality of yanking out the support of the state that's been the status quo for generations - and eliminating a region of the country - because of ideology.

Until you back your conclusions with anything more than your own opinion they remain completely unsupported and, in my view, totally illogical. The idea that 10-100 people can better defend the arctic than a population and rangers (who do live there) borders on the absurd and you'd better back that with something.&gt;I'm just saying we should gradually remove the support. People can adjust.

You have yet to justify why.

&gt;I never suggested getting rid of the rangers.

The Rangers are people who live in communities of the north. By suggesting getting rid of those communities you are, in fact, suggesting getting rid of the Rangers.&gt;To save money.

You haven't made a convincing case that we will or that your proposed changes will be a benefit to Canada. Cite something, anything reputable (beyond your own opinion) in support of such a drastic change.

&gt;I'm not suggesting we get rid of those communities. I'm suggesting we get rid of the subsidies.

I do not understand how you can say that eliminating a food subsidy - without any supports to replace it - would not adversely impact the survival of northern communities.

You want to make the north self-sufficient? It will require a lot of spending with no guarantees of returns. You don't want to make the north self-sufficient and still cut off funding? You're advocating its abandonment to one degree or another.

The free market is a wonderful thing but it categorically is not a magical force that solves all ills.&gt;I'd spring for the extra leg room, but $130 each way to Iceland? Might just be time for a vacation, Iceland's pretty exotic to me.

Apparently the seats are as follows:

- Regular: 30" legroom
- Large (+$24 one way): 33" legroom
- XL (+$33 one way): 35" legroom

&gt;And while I'm fine with a single bag... I think I better budget a fair amount for She Who Must Be Obeyed's wardrobe.

I hear that. I wonder at what point it's cheaper to dress up luggage as a human being and buy them a seat instead...I'm not a fan of the monument either, but...

&gt;The prime minister has received dozens of handwritten letters, typewritten notes and emails from people \u2014 including Conservative supporters \u2014 who question the idea of a such a monument, especially just a stone\u2019s throw from the Supreme Court of Canada.

'Dozens' is an earful?The alternating language between 'The Government' and 'The Conservative Party's post-election promises is a little disturbing to me. Is this a government communication or a fully partisan one? It sure looks like the latter.Britain's international clout slightly diminishes but not in an overtly noticeable way. The four Vanguards are laid up, though a couple of Commonwealth countries express interest in acquiring them after conversion to conventional missiles. The savings are split between the Royal Navy and deficit reduction. Russia, wanting to encourage the disarmament of its geopolitical rivals, actually decreases the number of airspace incidents around the UK. In the end, being a part of NATO and the EU is sufficient deterrent against aggression.

It depends, I think the headline policy is great. That it will take a *second* NDP term to fully implement seems to make this a bit of a non-announcement for any current student.
&gt;Ugh. Our towns and villages are dropping like flies. :(

Sad, but also inevitable. Me and other young people leaving my small town for careers and lives elsewhere over the years caused it to renounce town status a few years ago. There's just not the tax base to maintain services.Some do, but no one rational does.I just don't see any real consequences from taking 4 subs out of the nuclear equation. Britain would remain a non-superpower but still one with respectable military might that no nation would want to mess with, especially given its alliances. Russia wouldn't get more grabby in contested areas, for instance - it's not like there's a shortage of warheads elsewhere.Bless their civic-minded yet delusional hearts.
&gt;Once a new party is elected, can this change?

The NDP haven't exactly offered details but seem to be supportive. Trudeau has given definitive support for shipbuilding, but says increased funding for it will come from savings from not buying the F-35 - savings which are not guaranteed to happen.He was banned from /r/CanadaPolitics/ (no surprise), but created a very obvious alt account and began posting the same things in the /r/Canada/ F35 thread and /r/CanadaPolitics/ F35 thread at virtually the same time. An eagle-eyed (and handsome and brave) user noticed this and reported it. A day later his accounts were banned.

Kind of on the pricey side (paid about $180 each) but by far the best winter tire I've ever had and I absolutely recommend not skimping out on this sort of purchase.

Pour over reviews for all the brands. Don't settle for anything with low or even medium quality. Then shop around for the best price on good-quality brands. I can't overstate how much of a difference having good winter tires has been over having average ones I've experienced.I know Coast charges $40 to store tires for the season. [OK Tires] (http://www.grayauto.ca/) offers a similar service but I'm not sure of the price. O'Regans dealerships do as well, but they don't quote their price either.I won't feel comfortable until all the polls show the Liberals (or NDP, but that's looking unlikely) opening up an even wider lead on the Conservatives. The polls last time [consistently underestimated Conservative strength] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_in_the_Canadian_federal_election,_2011) by as much as 5.7%.This sort of absurd immaturity will only galvanize the support base of the candidate they're trying to protest. Hell, it might win her a few sympathy votes.

Utter stupidity and rightfully illegal.Yeah, I didn't mean to imply that was the average. That was the maximum, as displayed by the EKOS pre-election pollI don't agree. Militaries are useful as tools of foreign policy, which doesn't always align with that of even your closest ally. They're versatile tools that can be used for a wide variety of situations. The U.K. cannot rely on the U.S. to always abide by its interests.

Nuclear weapons just aren't versatile. Their purpose is to prevent others from using theirs, and in general making any enemy think twice about attempting to launch any serious attempt at damaging the country. The U.K. can expect the U.S. to not tolerate their obliteration.Well, I don't live there, so I'm not speaking for myself.

Realistically the U.S. gains far, far more in economic activity through trade with Europe ([$333B in exports in 2014] (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0012.html)) than it dedicates to its entire nuclear weapons arsenal ([~$20B per year projected] (http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/us-nuclear-weapons-budget-overview/)). The overall impact of 4 submarines to the nuclear mix is so trivial it's barely worth registering their withdrawal, no matter who owns them."Hard-working Canadians." That will end after election night, right?

When will there be a party to represent us lazy Canadians? I'd organize it myself but... meh. Seems like work.Savaging politicians is a national pastime, but it seems to be elevated to an art form for those who live in Ontario. The amount of pure venom directed at Wynne makes me wonder if maybe there's just a little bit of hyperbole going on - especially with growth forecasts showing at least modest amounts of positive growth.

It will be interesting to read the full text and hear some impartial analysis of it.I think Ontario might be overselling it a little, even if Wynne has implemented bad policies. The endless deluge of commentary over the bungled gas plant cancellation is a prime example - the story was so puffed up that one would think that all Ontario's financial problems would have been solved had the government not interfered. The rest of the country kind of perceives Ontario's political commentary as a bit overdramatic sometimes - be it under Wynne, McGuinty, Eves, Harris, or Rae.

Electricity prices in Nova Scotia (we don't call it hydro here - 60% of our power comes from coal, 9% from hydro/tidal) have been increasing, sure, but its our demographics that are hammering the province's economy.&gt;The wishful GDP growth that was used as the basis for our deficit?

Well, let's have a look at the [2015 budget] (http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/ontariobudgets/2015/papers_all.pdf) (page 258) vs. the RBC and BMO forecasts earlier.



Forecast GDP growth| 2015f | 2016f | 2017f
---|---|----|----
Budget | 2.8%| 2.5% | 2.3%
[RBC] (http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/provincial-forecasts/ont.pdf) | 2.1%| 2.5% | n/a
[BMO] (http://www.bmonesbittburns.com/economics/forecast/prov/provincialoutlook.pdf) | 2.0%| 2.4% | n/a

Per RBC's commentary: "Nonetheless, weaker than anticipated activity earlier this year, and our slightly dimmer expectations for the second-half performance, prompted us to reduce our real GDP growth forecast to 2.1% in 2015 from 2.8% previously."

I wouldn't really call it 'wishful' given RBCs previous forecast matched the governments, and next years forecast seems in line with government projections.

&gt;rising hydro costs 

A real concern ([up 9% over 2014] (http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/OEB/Consumers/Electricity/Electricity+Prices/Historical+Electricity+Prices)). At 11 cents per kwh for residential (average), though, it's still pretty cheap [compared to the United States] (http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a) with a national average of 12.98 cents (US) per kwh for residential.

Even Ontario's *peak* energy price of [16.1 cents/kwh] (http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/OEB/Consumers/Electricity/Electricity+Prices) is below the *average* paid in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, and much of the U.S. Pacific Coast.

&gt;and a failed $3.7B wind turbine project.

Which one is that? The only result I can find for that is Ontario buying $3.7B less from Samsung in 2013.

&gt;Is this overselling or an aggregate of disappointments?

It's an overselling of an aggregate of disappointments. I'm not defending Ontario's government as they've made more than their share of bad decisions, but it's been blown way out of proportion - and the rest of the country has to hear about it because Ontario's got the loudest media mouthpieces in the country.

Try dealing with the sort of crippling structural economic problems of Atlantic Canada. Ontario's a paradise of economic prosperity by comparison.

&gt;Please, share your wisdom from Nova Scotia on Ontario's matters

I don't think that was necessary.&gt;The NDP have to support balanced budgets to throw off the impression that they are pie in the sky socialists

It's the "Liberals voted for C-51" argument turned around to bite the NDP this time. Trying to pander to optics have hurt both parties while the substance of their positions are far more nuanced.&gt;That's a pretty chart but it was small-ball in getting your point across.

The only point was that GDP projections in Ontario's budget were not 'wishful thinking', which was accurate to the time it was created.

&gt;Our healthcare system (doctors AND pharmacies facing setbacks in the same month) that you refer to as small-ball and minor league are cuts that are being made in attempt at balancing a deficit in the budget that the OLP made. 

All three parties share blame in [Ontario's deficits] (http://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/5565132-the-long-sad-history-of-ontario-deficits/). The Liberals just bear more of it.

&gt;Hey, maybe if you were vocal about the crippling structural economic problems of Atlantic Canada then things could be different, like what Ontario is trying to do before it implodes on itself.

I don't think you understand the severity of the demographic catastrophe unfolding in Atlantic Canada, nor the urban-rural split that's crippled the economy as our outsized rural areas bleed jobs.

&gt;Our perception is our reality. What you perceive Ontario to be is a different reality than those experiencing it. 

Very True. The constant narrative of utter disaster in Ontario creates a feedback loop reinforcing it as gospel. A little outside perspective (and good old citation-backed facts) could help, assuming a willingness to listen.Layton got the Orange Wave really rolling with his appearance on the same program.

&gt;Ugggghhhhhh. The nature of conflict has changed. We cannot and must not continue to live in the 80s and 90s mindset of international conflict.

The death of peacekeeping is wildly overstated. 

&gt;The F-35 is a stealth multirole fighter. It is not a bomber. What a horrific misrepresentation of the aircraft and the platform. 

Fighter-bomber is a somewhat antiquated term for a fighter used in a ground-attack role, but it's hardly a 'horrific misrepresentation'.

&gt;But it will not be open. The LPC is saying it is open to everyone BUT Lockheed Martin. This is not an open competition and does not ensure Canadian experts get to evaluate all possible options for the RCAF.

I don't know if Leslie's prescription is optimal but I have no reason to value the opinion of columnist Tim Dunne's opinion over his either.How are you going to 'supply this information'? How is it available on Elections Canada's research for me to 'do my own research and stay informed'?

You really are going to have to provide something more than your opinion on this one.Good questions. All I know is that for it to be the number one issue for anyone is both surprising and depressing to me.What do you think they should do to change the opinions of those who disagree with you? And why should they?

Personally I think any point that contributes to the conversation should be upvoted, even if you disagree with it, but enforcing that it nearly impossible. Getting rid of inappropriate downvotes for opinions is one thing, but it's a whole other can of worms stopping people from heavily upvoting the things they agree with (or, as you put it, 'circle-jerk') and not touching those they don't.Note that they are close when you compare their poll right before the election to election results. They, of course, cannot predict what will happen in the next 2 weeks. They also over-estimated Liberal support (by +/- 2%) and under-estimated Conservative support (by a small margin) in the past 2 elections.Yeah, sorry, I mean Liberals in 2011 and NDP in 2008, both of which polled higher than their final result.I'm not a fan of it, but this is way more important to me:

If substantial changes to pharmaceutical copyrights are not part of this deal then that's a huge piece of news. It doesn't mean TPP is a good deal, just not as bad as it could have been.Layton was no saint. He was more than willing to sell out policies he said he believed in (national daycare, Kelowna accords) when there was an opportunity for partisan gain - specifically, 11 seats.

Building these new ships is great, but we have to support them a lot better than we have our current fleet.Seconded. Hopefully you factored parking costs into the equation of these increased benefits.Mandatory minimums don't work, and certainly don't act as any sort of deterrent. Otherwise the murder rate in Canada prior to 1961 would have been far lower than it is today, back when capital punishment was the [mandatory sentence] (https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkSyH6h6z6oC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=mandatory+capital+punishment+canada+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yOpfroN3lH&amp;sig=Qafuu-e_wyadxxXHORuGkl1ULdo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mandatory%20capital%20punishment%20canada%201961&amp;f=False) for murder.We didn't purchase the subs - we traded them for a lease extension on the [BATUS unit] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_Training_Unit_Suffield) in Alberta. The net acquisition cost was essentially nil. Would have been the deal of a lifetime if the things actually worked.The actual distribution of the poll is:

- "Close to one half of voters disagree Canada needs advanced stealth fighter jets to meet its national defense goals (47%), while just fewer than 4-in-10 think they are necessary (38%). One seventh don\u2019t have an opinion (14%)." - [Forum Research] (http://poll.forumresearch.com/post/1397/most-dont-think-we-need-stealth-jets/)Trudeau will offer a free vote. That way the NDP can save face by working with someone not openly flogging the deal, even though they know the Liberals will almost entirely vote in favour. That, combined with the CPC voting in favour, will be enough to pass the bill over NDP (and Bloc/Green) objections.The 'boondoggle' was not returning the subs when the problems became evident. My only comment was on the acquisition, not in keeping them.

The Conservatives have had their share of royal military acquisition screw-ups too. After being in power for so long they own a fair share of the blame for Sea King replacements and those same subs being in the state they're in, in addition to the slowly unraveling shipbuilding program (and the bizarre choice for the AOPS design).

Both sides have done acquisitions well, though. The Conservatives got us much-needed C-17s and handled the tank upgrade well. The previous Liberals got us the very well-regarded LAV-3, a huge acquisition program that's little-mentioned due to how well it went (after the Mulroney-era program was abandoned and largely restarted).It's based on the premise that the severity of punishment is a significant factor in the deterrance of crime. It isn't. The *certainty* of punishment is. [[1] (http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/Deterrence%20Briefing%20.pdf)] [[2] (http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5880&amp;context=jclc)] [Source] (http://www.dianatamblyn.com/2012/10/justin-trudeau-comic-geek-future.html) from when Trudeau attended the Montreal Comic-Con in 2012.I'd say it has more to do with differing philosophies and ideologies. What gets you counseling and community service in Sweden might get your hand cut off in a religious theocracy. 'Tough on crime' is also a great sound bite, but as even the most conservative-leaning jurisdictions south of the border are discovering it's exorbitantly expensive with little material impact.A U.K. MP agreed [in 2012] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/used-subs-a-daft-deal-for-canada-u-k-mp-says-1.1166047).

"Mike Hancock, the Liberal Democrat MP for Portsmouth South, said it's time the British and Canadian governments explained how the deal went wrong.

...

"I'm appalled we've done a dumb deal with an ally like this," Hancock said. "If this was the Americans, we'd say good luck and serves you right. But as it's Canada, I think there are a lot of questions to be answered."

Hancock said Canada should have been more cautious about buying them and should consider asking Britain for its money back.

"I think you should be making a case for it.""It's sort of what we [call the department] (http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/index.page).I've never bought the 'should be obvious' line of reasoning for any argument.

At the risk of going too far down a hypothetical path, if it were a contested seat would you monitor eastern results more closely and possibly change your vote accordingly?

I'm just curious (mainly about 'ABC voters') since this is such a tight race this time around.Jurassic Park reclaims the #1 spot at the box office, but with tough competition from Schindler's List, Groundhog Day, and of course the Super Mario Bros. movie.

I'm not advocating anything, just curious.&gt;Well maybe there's another factor involved here... And maybe that bug repellant actually worked because you didn't get 20 mosquito bites.

That's a great deal of 'maybes'. I still await any sort of support for your claims that severity of sentencing is the primary factor in deterrence.

From the Department of Justice's [review of all relevant literature] (http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/ccs-ajc/rr02_1/p4_1.html):

- "The research on both sentence certainty and severity are relevant to MMS and, on balance, the evidence suggests that severity may be less critical to deterrence than initiatives boosting the certainty of punishment"

Does deterrence through sentencing severity exist? Sure, to a degree. I still maintain (and am supported by evidence) that the *certainty* of punishment is more effective as a deterrent than the severity.

Thus, to quote the report again:

- "MMS [Mandatory Minimum Sentences], such as the Three Strikes and federal drug laws in the US, have produced some grossly disproportionate sentences."
- "From a utilitarian point of view, incarcerating occasional, non-violent offenders, for substantial periods, constitutes a colossal waste of justice system resources." - relevant to the case at hand
- "Therefore, MMS should not be introduced merely to placate a political constituency or without regard to a thorough understanding of the infractions or offenders for whom they are intended."I like Cullen, though I'm a little annoyed that during his [AMA] (https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3lh5wl/ama_hello_reddit_canada_nathan_cullen_here_ndp/) he ignored my question (along with several other questions, including the top-voted one).

I was way more impressed with John Moore's (Green/NWT) [AMA] (https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3mbr8i/hey_reddit_im_john_moore_the_green_party/) and Robert Prcic's (Liberal/Calgary) [AMA] (https://np.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/3nqhgx/i_am_the_liberal_candidate_for_calgary_nose_hill/). At least Cullen's wasn't as bad as Wynne's.I think you may have misread my [first reply] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/3ns8j8/crown_seeks_increased_sentence_for_sona_over_2011/cvrhj21?context=10000):

&gt;It's based on the premise that the severity of punishment is a **significant** factor in the deterrance of crime. It isn't. The certainty of punishment is.

Emphasis added for clarity. Saying the severity is not the most significant factor is not the same as saying it is no factor at all.This question is so loaded it could pay off the national debt.

I'll probably be voting Liberal because the incumbent Liberal MP has done a decent job, and both his NDP and Conservative challengers are not terribly impressive to me. On the national front I'm fairly ambivalent between Trudeau and Mulcair, but I am more disturbed by Mulcair's promises of 'asymmetrical federalism' and his extremely vague platform than the voting record of an MP / leader during a majority government while he's a member of the third party. I reserve the right to change my vote right up until I mark my ballot, though.

This isn't the most impartial way to phrase a question.I blame partisans of [party I don't like]. Everyone knows they're all [ad hominem attack here].

On the serious side, it's nice to be able to engage with someone with opposing political beliefs in a civil and honest manner. Some of the insights have been enlightening. Thanks for your efforts.&gt;I can't say people are acting as traitors in my view who are trying to strip the rights of natural born Canadians

Is calling someone a 'traitor' respectful? If not, you've sort of explained why such a comment isn't allowed.

I'd argue that it isn't 'substantive' either, as it makes no attempt to investigate or debate the issue, and instead simply dismisses those you disagree with using a label.Hi Stephen,

In some circles there is a lot of concern that a new wave of automation is going to severely impact employment levels in developed economies in the not-too-distant future. For example, Statistics Canada states that there are nearly 900,000 jobs in the [transportation and warehousing sector] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/econ40-eng.htm), a large number of which could conceivably be at risk. We've already seen examples of automated trucks in mining operations and automated warehouses such as Amazon's facilities displacing jobs, with the additional specialized employment created coming nowhere near offsetting the positions lost.

Is this a real problem, and if so, what can be done to prepare for it? It doesn't seem like any political body is interested in addressing it at all.The origin of Burnie's 'what does that mean?' habit. Wow.National finances are not analogous to household finances. Like them or not, the full Liberal-amended version is available on their site. The NDP's post-C51-repeal plans have never been stated. I have no idea why they have earned so much blind faith that they either won't introduce their own security bill or they'll introduce something better.

Mulcair is reaping a reward for being vague and noncommittal about his party's long-term plans.In national finances intelligent debt-fuelled investments increase earnings by growing GDP, and thus the tax base. If the present value of all interest payments from this new debt is $1 and the present value of new revenues directly resulting from this debt is $1.10 then there it is a wise investment - and there is no need to ever pay it off.

Conversely, if debt is cut to save the PV of $1 but the PV of $1.10 in revenue is forgone, that debt repayment is unwise.

Of course, the trick is in picking wise investments, but again my point was national finances are nothing like household finances. Oversimplified analogies are unhelpful.Indeed, higher employment levels generally lead to reduced crime. Of course, it's a little rich for the government to wash its hands of the situation when economic development on reserves is partly their responsibility and has gone largely neglected these past 9 years.Surely you're aware of the government's efforts to ban the niqab from citizenship ceremonies and the string of court cases to that effect. That's why the garment is in the political sphere, not because it has anything to do with the proposed hotline or any other legislation - although the Conservatives want to ban it for civil servants. The accusations of 'spin' aren't accurate when it's the Conservatives who opened this whole can of worms. &gt;Looks like this sewage controversy is splashing everyone.

I really wish you'd phrased that differently. Now I feel like I need another shower.&gt;Close to 8-in-10 Conservative voters say they are strong supporters of their party (78%), but this is only characteristic of about 6-in-10 Liberals (58%) or New Democrats (60%). This is because many of these voters come from each other\u2019s parties.
&gt;
&gt;3-in-10 says vote could change before election
&gt;
&gt;4-in-10 Liberals, New Democrats are voting strategically

These series of observations make me wonder if a Conservative victory (even as a minority) is far more likely than the headline portrays.I don't know what banker you use but every one I've ever heard of will demand repayment of the principal from individuals eventually. Governments do not face this obligation - so long as they make interest payments (and there's no cause to believe they will default) they never have to pay off the principal.

&gt;Government isn't responsible or disciplined enough for this sort of thing. 

Let's look at a really simple example - infrastructure.

Good infrastructure isn't necessarily an iron-clad guarantee of economic growth, but bad infrastructure is absolutely a drag on economic performance. Take a look at the crippling infrastructure problems in India if you need evidence of that.

Intelligent government investment in infrastructure pays great economic dividends to both the government and the populace. Good transportation links, adequate power and water supply, government has a role in all of these. So does the private sector, of course.

&gt;You're just justifying NDP drunk sailor spending. 

I have no idea whether the NDP would make wise investments or not. I'm only justifying intelligent spending. Government is not incapable of this - it's difficult, but not impossible as history shows. To claim otherwise is just unsupported ideological rhetoric.&gt;You can't tell me what the return of that bridge is. You can't quantify it. We can all quantify the cost of the bridge and the debt it incurred. But the benefit is in the domain of politics, not economics. You will say the bridge benefited us my X, I will say Y. If you can't quantify it, it doesn't count. At least, not counting it should be a guiding principle of government. 

Bridges are one of the easier things to measure in terms of economic impact.

Commission a study and put a couple cameras up to count traffic. At the same time, measure traffic levels on major arterial routes. Compare these to previous studies before the bridge went up. Is there reduced congestion in some areas? Better traffic flow? Survey businesses to see if they've noticed an increase in sales as a result.

You can count the number of transport trucks crossing the bridge. Then ask, say, the port if they've seen an increase in traffic over time. Filter out any outside events. Quiz shipping companies.

Building a new bridge? Start by looking at the economic impacts of similar bridges in similar communities. Commission your own report. Ask them to apply a conservative estimate of the increase in economic activity.

It isn't just politics, it's an area of [serious academic study] (http://mitl.mcmaster.ca/research/documents/Champlain_Bridge_Report.pdf).

&gt;You seem to have no problem spending money on things you claim derive benefits, but you can't tell us what the benefits are. Therein lies the problem. Cost/benefit doesn't work when half the equation is fuckled. 

Can I tell you *perfectly*? No. But, with careful research, I can give you a probable range of benefits. When the low end, most conservative scenario has benefits that exceed the cost of the investment then it would seem to suggest that the investment is worthwhile.

&gt;It's far better to budget within our means, to plan to spend on projects we accept that we can't quantify benefits for, and to stay in the black. That's responsible government. 

I don't agree.

Let's look at the whole rationale behind the current low interest rate environment. The underlying reason is to supply cheap money to spur investments in order to get the economy going. Why does this rationale only apply to the private sector? Assuming an equal level of diligence government can take advantage of the same low borrowing costs to create long-term economic improvements.

The other side of this is more philosophical. Say we put up a bridge. How long is it going to last? 50 years? Why should taxpayers today be paying the full sum of the bridge's cost? The benefits are not front-loaded. The cost of this investment should therefore be spread out over its lifetime so all those who benefit from it pay for it more-or-less equally.This isn't about respect for religion. It's about allowing a practice that inflicts [real, demonstrable psychological harm] (http://www.livescience.com/50453-why-gay-conversion-therapy-harmful.html) on many of those those who are subjected to it under pressure from peers, family, and religious groups.

Doing *real*, quantifiable harm to a person in the name of religion is something we should all object to, no matter what religion they participate in. This isn't some hypothetical philosophical argument about 'demeaning the value of a person', this is causing verifiable damage.

If this 'barbaric cultural practices' hotline ever opens I hope those who have suffered through these 'therapies' flood the lines with what they've endured.

Outlaw them all."It is a key obligation of governments in this country to continue Canada's long and distinguished humanitarian tradition to make sure that we are at the forefront of efforts to respond to suffering in the world, to meet the needs of the vulnerable, and for as many as can we support, to resettle refugees and asylum seekers on our shores." - Chris Alexander, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [June 16, 2015] (https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-2/S-7/)

I do not understand this government sometimes.&gt;Counting traffic \u2260 quantification of benefit.

Correct, which is why that is only one isolated metric in a slew of them behind economic impact studies. Others I mentioned are surveying business owners and measuring changes in shipping volume. There are legions more. Consult any of a thousand economic impact studies for more.

&gt;Again, I am only for using borrowed money for investing if and only if both costs and benefits can be known with equal precision. 

Then you can never borrow money. If you applied that philosophy in real life you could never buy a car, you could never own a house, you could never take out student loans to go to school. Businesses could never borrow to invest or finance a takeover. Your bar is impossibly high.

&gt;my preference is for all infrastructure to be financed through tolls.

- This is easy with most bridges. 
- It's feasible with some highways connecting urban centers - but most certainly not highways. Who's going to be able to afford to pay off the vast stretches of road connecting the tens of thousands of small communities flung over the vast geography of Canada? 
- This is very difficult with public transit. Virtually no public transit project in the world covers its own operating costs, much less pays back the initial investment, but large urban centers cannot function (and medium-sized ones cannot grow effectively) without good public transit.
- This collapses to impossibility when we get to local roads, hospitals, schools, and any of a thousand other infrastructure projects.

It's an ideological point that is impossible to implement in Canada, with wildly unknown consequences potentially far more dangerous than paying some interest on government debt.

[EDIT]: It's not me that's been downvoting you. This is a good discussion and I'd rather downvotes not happen.The government is not some helpless kitten here. If they have evidence of wrongdoing, prosecute. If not, suck it up and deal with it to fix the problems.Maybe. There are a lot of optimistic leaps of logic in this article. Trudeau was wise not to include any revenue projections whatsoever in his costing document.&gt;If we focused these new financial resources on healthcare, it could mean pay increases for hundreds of thousands of nurses, thousands of new doctors, and more hospital beds in desperately under-serviced rural communities.
&gt;
&gt;We could employ this tax revenue for education, shrinking class sizes nation-wide, employing tens of thousands of new teachers and upgrading classroom technology infrastructure to better meet the needs of the next generation in the information age.

This seems like an appeal to support legalization even though there has been no commitment of related revenues to any such programs.

&gt;Increased investment in Canadian infrastructure, reduced taxes and shrinking deficits all at the same time are a real set of outcomes if we regulate and tax an industry that, whether we like it or not, already exists on the black market today.

Combined with the previous list, $8 billion a year could do perhaps one or two of these things well, but  spreading them across all of these goals would spread the amount so thin as to be of questionable effectiveness on any one of them.

&gt;Canada needs to stay competitive in a changing world. We have an opportunity reduce our reliance on resource harvesting and fossil fuel sectors that fluctuate with an unstable global economy and the price of oil.

The impact of these new tax revenues would be even further diluted by reducing other economic activities.&gt;Words like 'could' and 'if' are critical here, I am simply drawing examples of how the new tax revenues could be used. 

Indeed, but you are including a very long wish list without making the point that we will have to be selective in how we distribute any potential new revenues for them to have an impact. The way it is presented makes it seem as though we can do all of these things in a meaningful way.

&gt;I wholeheartedly disagree on your last point. This is not how industry works. Legalization of Cannabis would in no way 'reduce other economic activities.' All else the same, the market already exists today, it is simply unregulated and untaxed.

Fair enough, but more to the point $8B doesn't even offset the [loss to federal &amp; provincial tax revenues from the drop in oil prices] (http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/oil-price-plunge-to-cut-4-3-billion-from-federal-revenues-this-year-report-says).

I'm not saying it's a bad piece, just the tone overly inflates the upside of legalization while being somewhat unclear on the point that $8B is not enough to cure all the ills listed.Why do so many NDP promises contingent on them getting a second term to fully implement? In their [fiscal plan] (http://www.ndp.ca/sites/default/files/news/balancedfiscalplan-en-digital.pdf) the entire 'Supporting Indigenous Communities' line item is only $2.3B over the first four years. That doesn't leave a lot for this program in their first term if they want to do anything else besides this (aside from the Missing &amp; Murdered Women's Inquiry they've budgeted at $40M budget over 4 years).Or, if economic prospects sour (as might be indicated with the IMF report), he'll have a bit more leeway to keep his spending promises.Proper conservatism in financial estimates can unlock wonderful things.It's not just this program, though. National day care would also [require a second term] (http://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/09/09/mulcair-ready-to-deal-with-provinces-on-daycare-plan.html). It seems a little optimistic for a party that's never formed government to bank on surviving a full first term as a minority, much less two.Move to Halifax! Aliant FibreOp is great! Houses are cheap! Job prospects are... okay! Tim Hortons are abundant! Donairs for all!

If that's not a ringing endorsement I don't know what is.Mulcair's condemnation on C-51 continues to ring hollow to me. It will keep doing so until he discloses, in detail, his security plans after repealing the bill.

Trudeau's attitude of 'wait to see what's in it before commenting' on TPP is an obvious dodge on the issue, but at the same time it's not an irrational position worthy of condemnation.Yes, I may have been playing a lot of Metal Gear recently, and been curious as to whether or not the crazy Fulton system in the game had any basis in reality. The article doesn't say if the operatives went "WA-HA-HA-HOOOOO!" on the way up, but I choose to believe they did.Paul Martin pulled it off with a signed deal with all the provinces 10 months after winning the 2004 election (where it was a campaign promise). I don't see why it should be materially more difficult for Mulcair.Yes, but it is binding the decision-making ability of a future government to ratify TPP or not by adding this extra condition that's not in the deal and, again, the addition of which is not urgent.

There are no grounds on which this compensation package was necessary now as opposed to something the next government could decide.There were three of us. It was most definitely not on Novice. Not at all. Stop looking at me like that.Thanks! We never had much luck with excavating - it was always a case of adding more sand than we ever managed to remove.It is bizarre that Trudeau has the same stance (and has been vocal about it) but is ascendant in Quebec while Mulcair suffers. The only thing I know for sure is that this has sunk whatever respect I had for Duceppe as a statesman (even if I always disagreed with his agenda).Nope. I just don't have blind faith in any political party. I won't believe the NDP is on the side of angels and goodness without something in writing saying they will not introduce any increased security measures after repealing C-51.

So far that's proven non-existent.When the Liberals were in third nationally and the NDP verging on majority territory you didn't see Trudeau going after Mulcair over Harper.

This display makes me worried that if we get a Liberal minority supported by the NDP it will be as short-lived and opportunistic as last time. It also makes me favourably reconsider Trudeau's refusal to consider cooperation with the NDP with Mulcair at the helm, something I thought was a foolish policy at the time.I didn't say Trudeau hasn't gone after Mulcair, just that he hasn't made him his primary target. Mulcair seems to be shifting his guns to Trudeau of late, and his rhetoric is a bit hotter than we've seen from the Liberal camp.We keep referring to rules and FAQs online as stuff comes up. Sand is always our nemesis - we always seem to deposit more than we clear.

We've beaten Pandemic on its hardest difficulty level (once) but this one has always been our bane.For the NDP the closest equivalent seems to be either [Shawn Dearn] (https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/shawn-dearn/1/438/618), the NDP's director of communications, or [Karl B\u00e9langer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_B%C3%A9langer), Mulcair's Principal Secretary during the last parliament and spokesperson during the campaign.

For the Liberals I'd guess the closest equivalent would be their director of communications [Kate Purchase] (https://twitter.com/katepurchase?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author).

Neither seem to have an exact 'Chief Spokesperson' role, though I could be wrong.&gt;So how's work going? 

No one else is in the office. Corporate clients are wasting my time with atrocious-quality information and expecting me to wring rational insight out of it, so I'm fiddling around on reddit while waiting for their banks to browbeat better quality information out of them.

&gt; Costco can't stop reminding me Christmas is coming, they had lights up in August, crazy how commercialized it's become.

I let my Costco membership lapse a year ago and I don't find I miss it. I used to love the place, but now I find it not worth the hassle of the overcrowded parking lot invariably long lines for moderate savings. Sobeys, Superstore (Loblaws), Pete's Frootique (sort of a local Whole Foods), and the Farmer's Market cover off everything I want to buy.

&gt;Have you tried the turkey yet, it's great this year. 

Looking forward to seeing family this weekend, and the food. Not looking forward to the long drive. Shrinking small-town Nova Scotia is beautiful. It's also depressing.I popped in a few times. The prices weren't unreasonable but tended to be slightly higher. I had more issue with the selection, which wasn't the greatest.

Ultimately I think the location was dead wrong. It might only be a 5-10 minute walk from the apartments on Brunswick Street, but there's no parking whatsoever and people are just conditioned to go to Superstore / Sobeys / etc. If they put this thing at the base of a residential tower it could have had much more of a pull. Of course, the rent would have been a heck of a lot higher too.

The place was positioned towards local and lower-income people who wouldn't have to travel so far to get their groceries. Transit, though, while not perfect is serviceable for most people without vehicles, and the Quinpool Superstore isn't dramatically farther away from the northern edge of downtown.

I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did.&gt;Small town NS is lovely this time of year. I like to imagine buying some of the incredibly cheap real estate I see when I go through. 

I've thought the same. Tax rates are high, assessments aren't as low as they should be, and you'll be lucky to break even should you sell it. It's still tempting, though.

&gt;TBH I sometimes go to Costco for the snacks. I'm shameless, and I get my money's worth.

I'll still pop in for a cheap hot dog from time to time even without a membership, I'll admit.I started having real fun with this game the moment I completely stopped caring about stealth or extractions. Anyone who isn't useful to Mother Base gets a sniper's lobotomy or a tank shell facelift.

I played through Deus Ex without killing anyone, Dishonored without killing anyone, but for some reason this game is a lot more fun to me being absolutely merciless.I would speculate it's because Trudeau and Mulcair face the media themselves more often than Harper does. Harper uses his staff more often so they become better-known than the Liberal or NDP equivalents.Well, let's have a look at it, then!

- **The Cover:** 'Building the country of our dreams'. Ugh. What a name.
- **Page ii:** It's kind of going unsaid that a lot of this so-called 'lost decade' was spent with the Conservatives in a minority situation that the NDP wasn't in any great hurry to undo. Anyway, let's look at the 'first 100 days' pledges.
 - **Improve your health care**: So is health care going to be improved in the first 100 days? "We will immediately inform... begin work to..." Well, it seems like the foundation will be laid, but not really an improvement in these 100 days that many will feel.
 - **Step up to fight climate change**: Depends on what 'stepping up' means, but if it just means setting targets then this one is attainable. Certainly no real impact would be felt in 100 days.
 - **Create and protect good jobs**: Assuming a small business tax cut of 1% will lead to significant new hiring / less job loss is a bit of a reach, but the cut should be doable. I doubt much of the new infrastructure funding would actually get distributed in the first 100 days.
 - **Make life more affordable for your family**: 'Taking the first step' towards universal childcare - which has an 8-year delivery date - is most certainly not going to do anything in the first 100 days. Changing the retirement age is a positive revenue-wise, but is something that will only have an impact longer-term. Capping ATM fees is such a small-ball policy it doesn't belong here.
 - **Make Ottawa work for you**: The Missing &amp; Murdered Indigenous Women's Inquiry is a noble thing but unless you're directly affected it's questionable if it belongs here. The old chestnut about repealing C-51 is getting a retread with no new details about the critical 'and then what?' phase. Senate expenses are high-visibility small-ball. Conflict of interest laws could have merit.
- **Pages iii-iv**: Pretty much the same info as in the 'balanced fiscal plan' and 'commitments to date' documents on the NDP's site.
- **Health &amp; Seniors Care**: Tommy Douglas was great and all, but I don't see the need to reference a 2004 CBC contest. Kind of a **BIG FAT LIE** in paragraph 4: the Chretien Liberals cut transfers in the 90's. Martin didn't become PM until 2003, and his Health Accords included a huge *increase* to health transfers. Boo.
 - 200 clinics isn't a whole lot, but it is a step towards increased health care coverage. Presumably these will be in areas not covered by private clinics? Adding doctors is a bit of a questionable policy - Canada is not suffering from a shortage of physicians. Adding nurses is a big plus though. 
 -The pharmacare promise is kind of vague. Lots of words like 'working towards' and lack of detail.
 - Good detail on the specific programs on preventative health care, though I have no idea what 'community-based research' is. Big plus for a focus on mental health, but what exactly is a 'Mental Health Innovation Fund for Children and Youth'?
 - New seniors home care and nursing home beds! Will these be owned by the feds, province, or private sector? An Alzheimer's and Dementia strategy seems like a big plus.


**Helping Families Get Ahead**

 - I have no idea why this childcare is going to take 8 years. Martin got a deal signed in 10 months with a 5-year implementation window. There's a **BIG FAT LIE** in the last paragraph of page 6 about 'hollow Liberal promises' when Layton was instrumental in the defeat of that signed deal.
 - The childcare plan is going to create 'tens of thousands of new jobs'? Where's that coming from? The subsidized employment from the new spaces?
 - Changes to paternal leave seem like positives.
 - Do we really have to resort to things like 'while Conservative-appointed Senators expense packs of gum'? Can't this thing stand on its own? Anyway.
 - Capping ATM fees is a pretty populist thing. And a government-mandated 'no frills' credit card? Are we opening a retail bank? A gasoline ombudsman? Taking action against payday lenders gets a big thumbs-up from me, though.
 - Not a lot of difference between the Liberals and NDP on immigration changes or refugees. Any improvements to recognizing foreign credentials seems like a positive.
 - Tough talk on 'tax fairness' that isn't really backed by anything other than a promise to 'crack down on tax cheats' and rolling back income-splitting and the TFSA limit increase. Whacking CEOs is popular, sure, but how many of them are there? Surely not enough wealthy ones that 'redirecting the stock option tax break' to poverty reduction will materially impact poverty levels. Why does increasing the corporate tax rate only impact wealthy Canadians and not the 'middle class'?

**Jobs and Infrastructure**

 - Gotta get our digs in on Harper first. That seems to be the framing for every policy point.
 - Cutting small business taxes isn't a bulletproof guarantee of more employment and may have unintended consequences.
 - Simplifying access to export services is a plus, but it should be simplified for all business sizes.
 - Oh boy, an increase net benefit test criteria. Have these ever worked?
 - iCanada. I wonder if Apple will sue. Sparse on the details as to how this will actually work.
 - The Innovation Tax Credit seems like a good idea in theory. I do hope the NDP actually plan to track how tax credits are working as the AG recommended in April.
 - The auto industry in Canada is subject to pressures (especially wage pressures) that government intervention is going to have a real hard time countering. I remain wildly skeptical of the NDP's efforts here. Thumbs-up for more funding to the Canadian Space Agency, though.
 - An aerospace strategy sounds swell, but is it a smokescreen to cover more government money funneled to Bombardier?
 - **Tip to the NDP:** Choosing the Space Shuttle as representative of your aerospace strategy is a bad idea. The Space Shuttle was wildly more expensive than advertised, didn't deliver on its promises, was a compromised design with real safety issues, is obsolete, and is also retired. Whoops.
 - The Ring of Fire has been touted forever - is anyone going to start opening mines so long as commodity prices are this low? Regional economic development agencies have a poor history of actually spurring rural development anywhere in the country.
 - I wonder if Mulcair's going to appear in any of these tourism ads that will have the Americans pouring over the border.
 - Speaking of pouring, a microbrewery tax credit! See the earlier point about monitoring tax credits to ensure they are effective.
 - Hello farm Supply Management, why are you a good idea again?
 - Tackling homelessness is a noble idea, but is affordable housing the responsibility of the feds? No mention of consultations with the provinces here.
 - **BIG FAT LIE** on page 19: The 1996 government didn't eliminate the minimum wage for federal workers, it redefined it to be equal to the minimum wage of the province / territory the worker lived in.
 - No replacement workers in labour disputes - what a can of worms that's gonna be.
 - Again, on balance, the changes to EI seem positive. Getting a little jab in at the Liberals seems petty given that their plan intends to spend every cent of EI on EI programs.
 - Infrastructure priorities seem reasonable. Tying a job number to the infrastructure plans is a bit of a stretch. Getting another jab in at the Liberals, this time even more petty than before. Future cuts? What future cuts? Distasteful.
 - Not a lot of raw dollar spending on this 'greener economy'. A $150M 'Green Municipal Fund' and $200M wastewater infrastructure program will barely fund anything. Electric cars for government fleets! 
 - What's a 'Green Bond'?

**Opportunities for Young Canadians**

 - Phasing out interest on student loans is an interesting idea, but over *seven years*? Really?
 - Thumbs-up for an increase to the grant program.
 - I remain skeptical of all these big job numbers tied to promises.
 - My skepticism of adding more doctors remains, as does financial assistance to a group that's already going to be quite well-off financially.

**Help Where It's Needed Most**

 - Poverty's over, guys, we're going to introduce an Act that says so and create a national council who will come up with the actual solutions. Because we don't know what they are.
 - Boosting the National Child Benefit Supplement will indeed provide additional financial supports to the most vulnerable families. It'll also provide supports to the richest families. That last bit didn't make it into the document for some reason.
 - Cutting the raising of retirement age is a positive, but painting it as a benefit to those about to retire is super dubious. $13,000 in 'additional retirement income' pales in comparison to what many would be earning.
 - Increasing the CPP/QPP! By how much? Doesn't say. But we'll get started!
 - Preserving public sector defined benefit plans? That isn't gonna be popular outside of the public service. Or cheap.
 - The changes planned to help Canadians with disabilities seem like positive (if super vague)
 - **BIG FAT LIE** on page 31. The Conservatives did not mandate the end of home mail delivery. Ugh.
 - Ending violence against women is a noble endeavour. One that deserves a better commitment than 'we will create an action plan' if you're going to bring it up. Expanding shelter resources is a good idea.
 - Implementing pay equity is one of those things that sure seems easy on paper.
 - Half of all government appointees to board have to be women? 40% of board members publicly-traded, federally regulated companies have to be women? Seems kind of draconian.
 - Fixing the northern food situation is a big positive.
 - Anything that engages more youth in sport is a positive.

**cont'd**
**Supporting Indigenous Communities**

- Lots of 'action plan' this and 'cabinet position' that. Fixing our 'broken treaty process' and land claims is a hell of a lot more complicated than just saying you'll do it - and won't be cheap.
 - Investments in indigenous education are sorely needed, as is skills training. Infrastructure too, but the amount seems low relative to the need.

**Safe and Secure Canada**

- Let's beat up C-51 without saying what our own long-term security plans are!
 - 2,500 new cops!
 - A national database on crime seems like a good idea, as does increasing focus on mental health.
 - Let's bury our marijuana policy somewhere in here with a brief one-liner and not bother explaining why decriminalization is better than legalization.
 - Why are we re-opening Lac-Megantic? If rail's so bad, why aren't we building safer pipelines? Whoops, wrong place to ask.
 - We fought tooth and nail to get the US to remove country-of-origin labeling and now we're implementing it ourselves, even after the WTO ruled against it? Uh oh. Hello to pandering to anti-GMO pseudoscience!
 - Improvements to animal welfare are always welcome.
 - Oh boy, C-51! We're repealing it! We're adding oversight! And then... well, we're not getting into that.
 - Canada can't cut the flow of money and weapons to ISIS, no matter how many of our allies we 'consult'.
 - How much will it cost exactly to fix the Conservative 'neglect' of Canadian Forces equipment?
 - Are we building all the ships in the National Shipbuilding Strategy? How much more will that cost?
 - Cheers to improved grievance processes and increased access to mental health.
 - A new Defence White Paper! What's gonna be in it? Well, we're not gonna say, other than we're reviewing the fighter replacement program.
 - Buttressing care for veterans is a positive. Why is eliminating the VRAB better than changing its mandate?
 - Big plans on the international stage. We're going to reduce nuclear weapons, work towards bringing peace to Palestine, and hand out generic drugs to the developing world. Maybe we're reaching a little here.
 - A mandate to trade offices to support SMEs is probably wise. 
 - Not a single mention of increasing ethics in international trade deals. I guess we're still selling armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia.

**Stronger Communities, Stronger Democracy**

 - Cap-and-trade for all, except provinces with their own plans. Great idea, but after all this talk about downloading expenses to the provinces isn't this just another example of that unless the feds kick in some support? Isn't a carbon tax a better way to go anyway?
 - Kind of hyping up Mulcair's record as Quebec's environment minister here. You'd have thought he'd have pushed for a price on carbon then.
 - More talk of meetings, 'incorporating considerations', and other vague policy. Where's the concrete targets mentioned earlier that Mulcair plans to bring to Paris in December?
 - Undoing the changes to the Navigable Waters Protection Act and Fisheries Act seem like positives.
 - Generally positive policy for Parks Canada.
 - More money for Mother Corp and the arts (though less than the Liberals are offering).
 - What services are included in 'ensuring all provinces provide health services to women who need them'? Why does PEI need to have an abortion clinic on the island when they pay for the service in Moncton? The geographic distance between the two is very small.
 - Is the NDP going to pay for the expansion of broadband? How much?
 - Would Canada release the 'aims and objectives of trade negotiations' even if keeping them secret was a condition of negotiating?
 - Eliminating (most) access to information fees is a big positive. The other changes don't seem too cheap.
 - Enhancements to privacy protections are welcome.
 - More powers to the Speaker. I wonder how they would play out in practice.
 - A Parliamentary Science Officer! Not a bad idea, if it pans out.
 - Changes to the PBO seem positive.
 - I don't see why MPs can't charge speaking fees - especially outside of their ridings, or if speaking outside the political sphere. Seems a policy tailored towards one individual.
 - MMP in the first mandate! I still think we should study the issue a bit first. I really think we should have a referendum, but oh well.
 - Abolish the Senate! Why is unicameralism better in a federal system when virtually every other federal country in the world is bicameral? Details not found.
 - Cheers to returning the right to vote to expats, but I'd rather they voted for expat representatives.
 - Restoring the long-form census is a solid policy.
 - Why are Quebec Supreme Court nominees to be chosen by the province? How come they get Bonus Treatment?
 - Bilingual fluency does not strike me as a primary criteria for Supreme Court 

On balance... kind of vague. Some good policies, a few questionable ones, and some really bold-faced Falsehoods.
Well, let's have a look at it, then!

- **The Cover:** 'Building the country of our dreams'. Ugh. What a name.
- **Page ii:** It's kind of going unsaid that a lot of this so-called 'lost decade' was spent with the Conservatives in a minority situation that the NDP wasn't in any great hurry to undo. Anyway, let's look at the 'first 100 days' pledges.

Thanks, I'm pretty proud of it. It seems some people are less amenable to a critical analysis of a very vague document, however. Pity that they resort to the downvote button rather than a rational response.

So much for the idea of a civilized debate.Because the paragraph says the 'Paul Martin Liberals of the early 90's'. Pretty glaring inaccuracy right there, especially since Martin increased health transfers more than any modern PM ever.If you have a specific critique, feel free to submit it. Just because you might disagree doesn't make it 'garbage' any more than your own opinion is.I did one when their [fiscal document came out] (https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3mh63z/liberals_release_fiscal_platform_surplus_by_2020/cvf2zts).

TL;DR version: Seems mostly reasonable though overly vague in some parts. A few dodgy commitments and it's tough to know if the underlying assumptions are correct.

I prefer the tone of the Liberal document to the NDP one. Though the Liberal one still gets some shots at Harper in, the NDP one is filled with them. I don't like how many concrete job numbers are in the NDP document.

On the whole, though, they're pretty similar in terms of substance. Which one you prefer depends on your politics.I posted this exact same video the day after the Jingle Vs. was posted and it got removed. I'm glad things have loosened up a little.Since these 'highway airstrips' are meant for use in emergencies - including a surprise onset of war - I think it's safe to say they're permanent fixtures.Thanks, I appreciate the support. Most others seem to think I'm negative on the platform. I'm not, I'm just not wholly supportive.

I wasn't actually referring to TFWs - there is a line item in there referring to banning 'replacement workers' in unionized work environments, aka 'scabs'. It's long been something unions have loathed, but doing so may have unintended consequences.
&gt;Just as the other parties are doing, the NDP is nabbing from the till with EI funding.  The intent of the program is that it should run an overall balance over the business cycle; taking good-times (such as these, with relatively low unemployment rates) and *increasing* the expenditure side of EI is inevitably going to cause problems in a real downturn.

If you examine the LPC platform, you will note that every dollar of (their reduced) EI forecast to be collected is expended in enhanced EI programs. That doesn't mean it will work out in reality, but they are at least promising not to run any EI surpluses.Personally I would prefer a floating EI rate that takes in enough to fund last year's program spending. That way any deficit or surplus is ephemeral and all EI programs are paid for by the rate. Trying to guess at the upcoming year's spending isn't as reliable.I used to love [Junkyard Wars] (http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/junkyard-wars.htm). Two teams would simultaneously build some sort of machine out of junk they dig out of a junkyard (which of course had a few goodies stashed by producers) which would then compete to see who better handled the episode's challenge. TLC ran it for a couple of seasons around 2000 I think. It was basically just a US version of a UK program called Scrapheap Challenge, but I loved it as a kid.Canada.com's [promise tracker] (http://www.canada.com/news/decision-canada/promises.html) seems fairly comprehensive. Of course, you should read the platforms (linked on the sidebar) for the most detail.Cross post from /r/technology/

Seems like this would be a great way to improve the city and civic engagement. We have a ton of local dev companies who could build it. Paging /u/wayemason/ ...I'm sure you could do all that stuff in Detroit before this app came out, but it seems to have increased civic engagement in the city. Anything that accomplishes that while improving transparency in government (by including monitoring of issues) is worth investigating.The last time, as in Martin's brief administration? To quote the [Globe &amp; Mail] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/kyoto-withdrawal-shames-us-all/article4180876/): 

"When Paul Martin became prime minister, his ambitious agenda included getting Kyoto back on track while reviving Liberal fortunes in the West. This was interesting, since the two goals were mutually incompatible. But before we could assess how Prime Minister Houdini planned to pull off this amazing stunt, he was gone, and Stephen Harper was in charge."

Martin's 'Project Green' wasn't as ambitious as it should have been but it had programs in place to reduce emissions (at a cost of [$10 billion over 5 years] (http://blogs.canoe.com/davidakin/page/732/?powerpress_pinw=48321-podcast%2F) - ~$1.7B of which was spent). Martin's government didn't survive long enough for them to have much effect.

The previous Chretien administration was completely neglectful of Kyoto, though.Yes, the current system is functional. This seems to be a superior alternative. I maintain it should be investigated.Well he was the right age for it. In fact here's a [photo] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/article4568920.ece/BINARY/w620/CPT745.280900C.JPG) to back up his love of the franchise as a kid.Someone needs a dose of a [Heritage Minute] (https://youtu.be/XO9Pe7UnHr0)!They did, but there's more to the story than just that, as my citation-backed explanation above illustrates. It would also be fair to say the NDP scuttled the most aggressive environmental program in Canadian history (along with national day care and the Kelowna accords) - that they could have ensured got implemented due to the minority situation - to gain 11 seats.

Hopefully if they hold the balance of power in a Liberal minority after October 19 they will be more committed to their espoused values than they were last time around.&gt;The record of the Liberals isn't much better than the conservatives on this issue. Liberal governments have gotten Canada involved in many armed conflicts over the years, and they have generally voted in support of combat missions when conservative governments are in power.

Let's examine that record in detail with a list of the conflicts Canada's been involved in since Confederation:

- [Fenian raids] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_raids) (1866-1871): Doesn't really count as it was Canada being 'invaded' by somewhat delusional American Irishmen, so it was a defensive conflict. Government: John A. MacDonald, Liberal-Conservative.
- [Second Boer War] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War): Canada was in its heady rah-rah Empire phase - and indeed didn't have control over its foreign policy yet. Public sentiment was overwhelmingly in favour of aiding the British, and Canada sent volunteers to fight. Doesn't really count as Canadian involvement in the decision to send troops was somewhat limited. Government: Wilfred Laurier, Liberal
- World War I (1914-1918): Canada still didn't have control over its foreign policy and pro-Empire sentiment was strong - at least at the onset of war. Government involvement in sending troops was still somewhat limited, but this example is slightly more relevant than the Boer War. Government: Robert Borden, Conservative (then Unionist) Party
- Spanish Civil War (1936-1939): The [Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie%E2%80%93Papineau_Battalion) was a group of Canadian volunteers who fought for the losing Republican side of the Spanish Civil War. This Battalion was not authorized by Canada, but William Lyon Mackenzie King let them leave to fight (Liberal).
- World War II (1939-1945): Canada had control over its foreign policy for this one, so Mackenzie King's (Liberal) decision to go to war was an entirely Canadian one for the first time. Not that public sentiment would have allowed him to remain on the sidelines.
- Korean War (1950-1953): Canada joined the UN Army in 1951, after Louis St. Laurent (Liberal) struggled to reverse some of the huge demobilization after then end of WW2.
- Vietnam War (1955-1975): Under Diefenbaker (Conservative), Pearson (Liberal), and Trudeau (Liberal) Canada was a non-belligerent country - though the conflict only really stepped up with Western involvement under Trudeau. Nevertheless 30,000 Canadians went south of the border to fight with the US Military. We sent a small forgotten contingent in 1973 to help enforce the Paris Peace Accords.
- Gulf War (1990): Brian Mulroney (Progressive Conservative) joined the US-led coalition to force Iraq out of Kuwait. The Conservatives and Liberals [voted in favour] (http://www.wrmea.org/1991-march/canada-escalates-gulf-military-role.html) of enforcing UN Resolution 678 that authorized the war. The NDP voted against.
- The Yugoslav and Somali involvements were both peacekeeping operations, except for...
- Kosovo War (1999): Canada joined the air campaign despite no UN resolution in favour of it under Chretien (Liberal). Both the Conservatives and NDP supported the intervention, although the NDP [reversed that support] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ndp-breaks-ranks-on-kosovo-bombing-1.189645) 2 months after bombing began (after Alexa McDonough replaced Svend Robinson as leader).
- Afghanistan War (2001-2014): Canada dispatched troops under UN Resolutions 1378, 1383, and (especially) 1386 under Chretien (Liberal) with the support of the Conservatives. The NDP voted against the deployment initially, but one month later supported the mission. The Liberals supported the 2006 vote to extend the mission brought forward by Harper (Conservative).
- Iraq War (2003-2011): Canada was again a non-belligerent under Chretien (Liberal), although under pressure from the Conservatives to join the US invasion. Canada did not preclude Canadian military members in the US on exchange programs from participating, and some Canadians joined the US military as in Vietnam.
- Libyan Civil War (2011): Canada under Harper (Conservative) elected to join the air war in Libya under UN Resolution 1973, with both the Liberals, Bloc, and NDP [voting in favour] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/commons-unanimously-backs-canadas-deployment-to-libya/article573406/) of the idea.
- Anti-ISIS bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (2015- ): Harper (Conservative) dispatched Canadian aircraft to participate in the bombing of ISIS positions in these countries despite a lack of UN resolution. Both the Liberals and NDP are opposed.

**TL;DR:** In most modern conflicts the Liberals have supported intervention. Every intervention except Kosovo (which they supported) and the ISIS campaign (which they opposed) has been under the auspices of a UN resolution backing the effort. Less well-known is that often the NDP supports modern armed intervention as well (Kosovo, Libya, and 'sort of' Afghanistan).
Thanks for the insight! It makes me optimistic that this sort of thing is actually feasible (and wouldn't cost a fortune).It's just a silly post and in no way an endorsement of anyone. If it were Harper or Mulcair at the same event saying the same thing I'd post it the same way. 

There's ten thousand other threads on policy and other real issues, both here and on /r/CanadaPolitics/. Nothing's being 'diverted' here. Relax a little.&gt;And it was only after the the Gomery findings and 13 years in power that the Liberals stuffed national childcare into a federal budget bill they knew would be voted down

That's not accurate. The child care pledge was [part of Martin's 2004 election platform] (https://books.google.ca/books?id=6RDxd43z0wIC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=liberal+2004+platform+child+care&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R9WHwxzijz&amp;sig=yaIZ2vsMtSoRJo40J5w8mbGBr7M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=liberal%202004%20platform%20child%20care&amp;f=False) prior to the conclusion of Gomrey. Child care was a part of that platform unveiled before the June 2004 election, by which point the Gomrey Commission had only been in operation for 4 months, and his first findings were still a year and a half away (released November 2005).

The timing and motivations are also completely irrelevant. It was a signed deal that the NDP could have helped enforce by holding more-or-less the balance of power in Ottawa. Same story with Kelowna and the 'Green Project'.&gt;The childcare pledge was also in the 1993 Red Book and it wasn't actually put up for a vote until after Gomery, so I'm afraid that one actually is accurate.

The key differences being a) a change in Prime Minister and b) a minority situation wherein parties claiming to support this initiative held the balance of power. This was a gold-plated opportunity for Layton to advance issues he claimed he supported. He squandered it for 11 more seats.

&gt;No political party could possibly have voted confidence in the Liberals after the Gomery report came down and they all promised that they would vote against the Liberals at the next available opportunity, you understand that, right?

No, but nothing was preventing from abstaining from the [Conservative motion] (http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=dd6137b4-81bc-4747-b7ed-d49c5f9bb22b) and waiting for the election [at the release of the full Gomery report] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/martin-pledges-election-after-final-gomery-report-1.548028). Then both national child care and Kelowna could have been funded and Harper could not have undone them, just as he was unable to undo the National Health Accord until it [expired in 2014] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-health-accord-expires-prompting-protest-uncertainty-1.2592934).

There's speculation the NDP didn't want to lose child care, the environment, and native rights as issues they could rally their base around so Layton sunk the government [before these could be funded] (http://skidcrease.com/2012/08/23/the-dark-side-of-jack-laytons-legacy/). I don't know if I fully buy that Layton was that opportunistic but he sure wasn't a staunch defender of those ideals in 2005. That the NDP are breathlessly extolling the virtues of national child care now without anyone really pointing out how they could have implemented it 10 years ago is pretty cynical.- Mulcair started out pretty popular with the fans but it looks like he's going to come up a little... short.
- "You know nothing, Justin Snow."
- I don't like Harper but I am on record as not approving of him winding up like Joffrey did.
- I don't think dragons are carbon-neutral.
- Niqabs seem like they'd be pretty warm, but none for anyone in the north. Thanks Duceppe!Chris is one of the only people I find to be absolutely hilarious when his attempts to be funny completely fail... so I guess it wasn't a failure? Whatever, you keep being you, Chris.
&gt;You're joking right?  Any party maneuvering for political reasons to keep another party in power even after that latter party was found to be accepting brown paper envelopes full of cash would have promptly been destroyed for all time by the Canadian public (and rightfully so). 

You may want to review the conclusions of the Gomery Commission which exonerated Martin. In any case, your timing is off - the election was called before any conclusions were released. Your 'brown envelopes stuffed with cash' doesn't gel with the Commission's conclusions.

Of course there was opportunism. The Martin government probably had to fall but there was no reason Layton had to do it on Harper's terms, before child care and Kelowna were funded. The NDP were just as opportunistic as the rest. Maybe more so. Hopefully they've learned to put their ideals ahead of partisan gain as it looks like we're headed for a situation similar to 2004.&gt;The report didn't exonerate Martin, it said it wasn't able to confirm evidence that he was aware of the sponsorship dealings, which is an important distinction.

To quote the report itself:

"**Mr. Martin**, whose role as Finance Minister did not involve him in the supervision of spending by the PMO or PWGSC, is entitled, like other Ministers in the Quebec caucus, **to be exonerated from any blame** for carelessness or misconduct." - [Page 77] (http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/groupaction/report/ES_assigning%20responsibility_v01.pdf) (PDF)

I do not understand where this line of argument is coming from when the historical record is easily accessible, and we're getting way off track from the original point which was: 

- Martin ran an election with national day care in the platform and won.
- This was months before the Gomery commission released its findings.
- Jack Layton purported to support national day care.
- Paul Martin got a signed deal on national day care from all 10 provinces.
- Jack Layton sank the Martin government before national day care could be funded, and before the Gomery Commission report came out.

All of this is historical fact which I've backed up with multiple citations. I question who 'on the hill' you were working for.Spoiler alert, the Energized Dairy Gathering Absorption Rig was a huge money-losing project for Monarch Labs, completely blowing its research budget.

Some say it's a debt for the Mad King to deal with, but I say that E.D.G.A.R.'s the one in the hole.&gt;Wait, Jack Layton with 19 seats in the House of Commons was able to singled handedly sink a government with over a hundred seats?

Mmhmm. Layton's 19 plus the Liberals' 133 = 152. The Conservatives and the Bloc wouldn't have been able to overcome that with their combined numbers.

&gt;You have a very unusual way of trying to make Layton the cause of everything bad that happened to the Liberals.

Never said anything of the sort.

&gt;Yes, the Liberals weren't corrupt, they did nothing to deserve a non-confidence vote. 

I specifically said the Martin government probably deserved to be defeated. I also said there was no reason for a purportedly 'progressive' party to do so until the programs it claims it cherished were funded so the subsequent administration couldn't undo them.

&gt;Keep telling yourself that.

No need to be hostile.&gt;A person with Danny Williams insight could have focused the article on what only a former premier could know, and compare Harper to former PMs in that respect.

I've heard him speak briefly on the subject. He didn't have much to say about Chretien but he found Martin 'honourable' and was 'able to work with him'. I suspect his favourable opinion came about because Martin agreed to the Atlantic Accord.

He contrasted that with Harper, who he claimed was more focused on his own ideology rather than what was 'best for the provinces' - driven, I'm sure, by Harper's efforts to neutralize that same accord.
&gt;You totally missed the point that I was making.



&gt;How is Layton (with just 19 seats) the guy responsible for the Liberals losing a confidence motion that all of the opposition voted against but Duceppe and Harper, who had many times more seats, aren't responsible?

Never said they weren't. Just that Layton turned his back on deals he claimed he supported.


&gt;I always have a chuckle whenever I hear Liberal partisans try to weave a narrative wherein Layton is responsible for their demise (Duceppe and Harper are apparently either not human beings who voted against the Liberals or don't have human agency or something).  

I have no idea where you get the notion that I'm a 'Liberal partisan'. I'm not - I have no loyalty to any party and I'll thank you not to make such assumptions.

I have backed all of my corrections to your interpretation of history with citations.

&gt;I find it especially amazing that Liberal partisans who try to twist this story never seem to be able to admit that Liberal corruption might be to blame for the Liberals' demise.

For the *third time:* Martin probably deserved to be defeated.

Please read my posts before formulating a response.&gt;Layton promised to support the Liberals even when the full depth of their corruption was revealed?

Considering the 'full depth of their corruption' wasn't revealed until February 1, 2006 (after the election that brought Harper to power), by your own standard Layton participated in prematurely bringing down the Martin government.

&gt;Do you have a citation for that?

If you read what you quoted, I said Layton said he supported the *deals*, as in child care and Kelowna.

As for those, his [voting record] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Jack-Layton%28554%29/Votes?sessionId=141&amp;page=9) speaks for itself:

- 3rd reading and adoption of Bill C-292, An Act to implement the Kelowna Accord - Member Voted Yea
- During the French language debate Layton [claimed credit] (https://books.google.ca/books?id=ApnzhHz-N3oC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=jack+layton+paul+martin+child+care&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5xeCuVNFPd&amp;sig=2Vm84-PdY-qL5MJxfRjAtbmJb6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jack%20layton%20paul%20martin%20child%20care&amp;f=False) for pushing Martin to implement his child care deal, even though Martin campaigned on it in 2004.I will spell it out one last time:

- There was already going to be an election 30 days after the full Gomery report came out.
- There was no reason to have an election in January of 2006 instead of November 2006.
- In playing along with it, Layton betrayed his ideals and deals he helped broker for naked partisan gain. Had he waited a measly couple of months both child care and Kelowna would have been funded and untouchable by Harper.
- The Liberals earned their fate. Layton showed that the NDP are no saints either.

I have yet to hear a rational retort to this.You can keep repeating the 'corruption' mantra as much as you like. The practical effect of Layton's actions were that we lost national day care, Kelowna, and Kyoto. You seem to not want to acknowledge this irrefutable historical fact. You also wildly overinflate the scale of the sponsorship scandal - it would barely make headlines south of the border.

Layton spun good rhetoric and was a generally good politician but he does not deserve the lionization of his legacy that he's been given. The NDP are not saints.Since you no longer seem remotely interested in actually answering any of my points - not that you tackled many throughout the entirety of this thread, preferring redirection and repeating your talking points - this is the end of this conversation."The Kelowna Accord was a cynical insult."

Jack Layton had a hand in crafting it, supported it, and the NDP voted for it every time it came up.

Of course, Layton also killed it (along with national day care and $5 billion towards Kyoto implementation) as soon as he smelled an opportunity to win a few more seats.
I guess you could call that a veiled insult.If he saw this coming and it was his idea to [promise balanced budgets] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tom-mulcair-says-ndp-s-balanced-budget-commitment-was-his-idea-1.3266310) then I have a hard time seeing Mulcair staying in the leadership role if he loses a significant number of seats. Those were the 1-2 punch that have the NDP still trying to pick itself up off the mat.Yes, we were. But if Layton had waited those few months then national day care and Kelowna would have been fully funded and Harper would not have been able to cancel them despite his ideological opposition, just like he could not cancel the Health Accords until they expired in 2014.

It's not a 'meme', it's parliamentary history."There are great people running for every party."

That was extremely refreshing to hear. If he wins, I sure hope the confrontational rhetoric gets toned down from what we're used to.I'm in Halifax West where the Liberal incumbent isn't facing a real challenge. He's done a decent enough job as MP. The NDP's candidate put in a decent performance at the riding debate but hasn't really impressed me. I am not inclined to vote Conservative.

There's not enough difference between the national Liberal and NDP platforms to override my opinion on who would be the best local representative so I am leaning towards voting Liberal. I will wait till the 19th to cast my ballot, though, just in case anything comes along to change my mind.Blair says both the Conservatives and NDP [courted him] (http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/23/bill-blair_n_7648330.html). To quote:

&gt;\u201cJack [Layton] and I were neighbourhood guys,\u201d Blair said, and Regent Park was a neighbourhood that was beset with difficulties.
&gt;
&gt;\u201cThere was a lot of low-income [issues], a lot of poverty. A lot of violence was taking place, mental health issues, the homelessness issues, poor housing, lack of affordable and supportive housing for those who really needed it, and I was responsible for policing and the safety of that community and Jack was its elected representative. ... We were partners.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;But Blair and Layton did not share the same ideology, he said. His personal politics were more aligned with the Grits \u2014 \u201cif I have personal politics.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;\u201cI tried to show not any of that while I was a police chief,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to work really closely with everybody.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;Blair also suggested that he rejected advances by the Tories because he disagreed with their position on law and order. 

There's more of his offered rationale in the linked interview. Whether there's more to it than that is up to the reader to decide.Two months ago I would have thought anyone saying Fillmore had a chance would be a delusional optimist. Now I'm floored at how close the contest is. I'm obviously not as clever as I thought, so I wouldn't dream of guessing how this one's going to turn out.

Megan Leslie's been a fine MP. Fillmore is intelligent and well-qualified. On the plus side, whichever one of them wins seems like they will do a good job for the riding.That would bolster the case for Topp if it were to happen. If the NDP suffered a seat loss significant enough for Mulcair to leave he would be seen as 'untainted' by it.
&gt;This works against the Liberals too: Why did the liberals refuse to cooperate with Layton?

Given how much input Layton had into the budget I'd say they worked with him more than any governing party has with an opposition party in Canadian history. Could they have done more? Maybe. Doesn't excuse what Layton did.Is there anything like QP on the international stage that leaders participate in?It seems unlikely that this behaviour will impact her chances on election day, unfortunately. The riding's never been held by anyone but Conservative / Alliance / Reform and she pulled in ~76% in the past 2 elections.'Chop' how? Do you have a rational critique to offer?I'm not defending anyone, I'm just asking the rationale behind your original post. I haven't seen any commentary about stealthy tax hikes that would impact the middle class to the tune of double his proposed tax cuts.Looks like it happened [around here] (https://www.google.com/maps/@44.769777,-63.5801237,3a,75y,251.73h,75.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srHUO4QsUafwbFs4Ap4lfDQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1). They're lucky they weren't killed.Okay, let's have a look at them right from the [Conservatives website] (http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/our-new-tax-breaks-explained/), courtesy of recently-in-the-news MP Candice Bergen:

- Doubling the Child Fitness Tax Credit from $500 to $1,000. Is this an actual tax cut for families? Beats me. The Auditor General has no idea either, since a report on it was [kept hidden] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/auditor-general-report-child-fitness-tax-credit-report-kept-hidden-1.3051897). Insufficient evidence to call this a material benefit.
- Increasing the monthly UCCB to $60/child for children over 6 and to $160/child for children under 6, and increase the child tax deduction. Trudeau says he's implementing a means-tested tax benefit that will be more generous than that to the middle class. Will it be? Maybe, maybe not. Call it 'close enough' to cancel out.
- Income splitting, according to the PBO, benefits [high- and middle-high income households] (http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/federal-governments-income-splitting-plan-will-benefit-15-per-cent-of-households-higher-income-earners-pbo). Of course, 'middle class' is ill-defined, but it seems the majority won't be able to participate in this one.

Will Trudeau's plan be more generous than Harper's promises? Beats me. Too many moving parts. I can't see any evidence that they will be massively worse off, though. If you do, feel free to provide it.My point was more that the Auditor General does not know if it is working effectively or not and has called for a comprehensive review of all tax credits. It seems Ottawa is happy to announce tax credits but doesn't have the slightest idea if they're actually working as intended.AH (and RT in general) ham up generally nonexistent interpersonal conflicts for comedy. If there were any real serious tension between them they probably wouldn't work so well together.The Sherbrooke Declaration and 'Asymmetrical Federalism' will always be the source of massive disagreement between the NDP and Liberals. Mulcair's been pushing these pretty hard, perhaps to the point where it makes him irreconcilable to Trudeau's vision for the country.- Deduct from that very slightly higher health care costs. There will be a marginal uptick in marijuana use, and associated small costs with a rise in correlated health issues and addictions - which are still very mild compared to alcohol and tobacco.
- The add the savings from using legalized cannabis in place of far more expensive alternative treatments for some select ailments.
- Deduct the cost of a new licensing, inspection, and quality-control bureaucracy.
- Then add to that the savings from no longer enforcing current marijuana laws. In 2002 this was estimated at [$500 million] (http://www.med.uottawa.ca/sim/data/Marijuana_e.htm). Some laws will still be enforced (large unlicensed grow-ops, anything linked to organized crime, etc.) so we don't get the full savings, but we will get a huge chunk of it.

So yeah, on balance, marijuana legalization makes overwhelming sense.Drove past an nearly full parking lot at the school it was being held at on Monday. Decided to wait until election day to cast my ballot.I have my problems with list member MPs but the author is overselling things. Germany and New Zealand, the most comparable countries to Canada out of those that use MMP, haven't collapsed into a morass of undemocratic hyper-partisanship.Read them [for yourself] (https://www.liberal.ca/wayne-easter-on-our-amendments-to-c-51/) and decide. Alternatively, read the [full text of their proposed amendments] (https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/03/C-51.pdf) if you don't want any political spin on the summary.I don't think the assertion that Angela Merkel has managed to craft a decisive government not constrained by partisanship or beholden to 'fringe' parties really needs much in the way of support, does it? There's a wealth of evidence on issue after issue that the German government is capable of strong leadership in spite of the CDU only holding 40% of the Bundestag.

In New Zealand John Key has managed to capture 60 of 121 seats in the unicameral House of Representatives, minimizing the need for compromise. During the whole MMP era the 2 major political parties (National and Labour) have come close to capturing majorities in every election, but not quite crossing the threshold. Every government since MMP was introduced has lasted 3 years, no change from the duration of government in previous 40 years prior to MMP being introduced in 1996.That's a huge snip spanning two countries - and two sides of the planet.

&gt;Strength and stability are not equivalent to representativeness, accountability, and responsibility -- which is clearly what Canadians want.

- Proportional representation is by its very nature more representative. A party taking 40% of the vote gets closer to 40% of the seats under PR than FPTP. Under FPTP that could range anywhere from 30%-60% of the seats, depending on the geographic distribution of support that support. PR is more representative of the wishes of the totality of Canadians.
- PR is more accountable, for the reasons above. If a party drops 20 points in popular support, under FPTP they can limit the damage by shoring up 'safe' ridings and trying to split the vote in others. Under PR, they see a proportionate drop in their seat count - they are more accountable to the voters for whatever caused such a decline.
- 'Responsibility' is a vague concept that can mean very different things to different people. It's difficult to imagine an electoral system that could resolve this, but the increased accountability under PR would seem to be a positive step.

Yes. Italian coalitions colluded to distort their list memberships in 2001. This isn't a fatal flaw with MMP, however, as these sorts of tactics can be prohibited.Sort of, but it's a little more than that. They bash on each other all the time, after all. With Jeremy, it stands out and is perhaps a bit more noticeable for two reasons:

- It's fresh material. We've heard them rag on Geoff for playing poorly, Ryan for constantly flubbing up words, etc., for a long time now. With a new(ish) person it's a whole new avenue of comedic insults.
- By 'bashing' him they're also focusing attention on him. That's absolutely crucial in introducing someone (relatively) new to the audience.

That's my two cents anyway.It was a complicated manipulation of 'list members' to benefit the main vote. They set up phony ('decoy') lists so their main candidates wouldn't suffer any vote losses to list candidates - list candidates made up only 25% of the seats, after all. Both main parties did this, so it wildly benefited a 3 party (Forza Italia) to such an extreme degree that they did not have enough candidates for all the seats they won - though they still wound up being a very minor party overall.

There's more details on the Italian Wikipedia. The [translation isn't great] (https://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_civetta&amp;prev=search) but you get the gist of it.&gt;Probably whether I about the UN drug treaties. 

In the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, cannabis was categorized as Schedule IV drug, the most dangerous classification available. The requirements for this classification are that the drug is "particularly liable to abuse and to produce ill effects" and that "liability is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages".

To quote the [2002 Canadian Senate report] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/371/ille/rep/repfinalvol3-e.htm), "At the U.S.\u2019s insistence, cannabis was placed under the heaviest control regime in the Convention, Schedule IV. This regime included drugs such as heroin (the WHO considered any medical use of heroin to be \u201cobsolete\u201d). The argument for placing cannabis in this category was that it was widely abused. The WHO later found that cannabis could have medical applications after all, but the structure was already in place and no international action has since been taken to correct this anomaly."

Marijuana does not belong in this treaty by its own definitions under the heavy control scheme it is listed. Cannabis must be rescheduled - no government should be held accountable to adhering to the spirit of this agreement instead of the (contradictory) letter of it.Not much of a surprise. With their slide in the polls the NDP have to shore up the seats they have. Chisholm will have a hard time holding his seat and it seems Megan Leslie could also use a bump from the leader visiting the region.As far as I can tell it's not illegal. Elections Canada [wants to make it so] (http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rep/off/r40&amp;document=part1&amp;lang=e), but it doesn't seem that any such language is currently in the [Act] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-2.01/FullText.html).I wonder why the landing gear is painted green. It's an interesting colour choice.No, Tom, no one 'deserves' a shot at governing. You have to earn it. We'll find out if you did on October 19th.

&gt;"Remember Stephane Dion? Remember Michael Ignatieff? So much road kill before Mr. Harper's machine,"

Your own [atrocious attack ads] (https://youtu.be/DyANc-dv5EM) sure as hell didn't help the anti-Harper banner you're claiming to champion.&gt;There's the famous Jack Layton quote: 

And here's Jack Layton [starring in a contradiction] (https://youtu.be/DyANc-dv5EM) to those idealistic words.

It's easier to write stuff than it is to live it.&gt;The NDP claims that on or around Sept. 11, William Amos \u2014 who is the Liberal candidate in the nearby riding of Pontiac \u2014 \u201cFalsely advised\u201d Gatineau resident Marie Dumesnil-Renaud \u2014 who is listed as a staffer at Turmel\u2019s constituency office \u2014 that the NDP incumbent \u201cis extremely ill,\u201d a charge adamantly denied by Amos\u2019 campaign spokesman Marcel Chartrand.

So an NDP staffer is the main witness in this complaint? I certainly hope they have more robust evidence than he-said-she-said for such a serious accusation.&gt;Ok? I wasn't arguing that the NDP is a True beacon of integrity and hope, I was just providing evidence to another user's claim that the "hope&gt;fear" has been used extensively in politics before this specific Trudeau ad, as requested by ArthursRock. 

Is it fair to categorize Layton's letter as 'political speech', though? I have my problems with the guy but I wouldn't go so far to classify his farewell missive as a purely political message.

&gt;It's not like the Liberals have never contradicted themselves or broken promises.

No political party is a shining beacon in that regard.I really wonder who she is, and if she legitimately believes these sorts of theatrics are beneficial to democracy. I have no problem respecting her political beliefs if she's an ardent conservative, but these sort of antics are just embarrassing.&gt;How boring is this sub going to be after the election?

Yeah, all we're going to have is the drama of minority governments jockeying for power (bonus drama if the Conservatives win a minority), possible legalization or decriminalization of marijuana, and a complete overhaul of the way we vote.

Totally uneventful.&gt; My question is: How can any rational Canadian with a moral compass look at this and still vote Conservative? 

- They embrace conservative philosophies (fiscal, social, or both) and feel they don't have anywhere else to turn.
- They're generally happy with the way things have gone the past ~10 years.
- They believe the Conservative promises will benefit them more so than the other parties.
- They're religious. The Liberals lost the religious vote when they legalized same sex marriage and voiced support for abortion. The NDP largely never had it. Never mind that the Conservatives did nothing to undo either of those policies, many religious folk still consider them option #1.
- Many non-European immigrants tend to come from countries with more conservative moral values than Canada.
- And, finally, [nobody votes rationally] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-psychology-of-voting-why-youre-not-as-rational-as-you-think/article26755921/).

Reasonable people can vote Conservative, even though I see them as an unreasonable party with an unreasonable leader.&gt;Look, I know a lot of this sounds extremely general, and that's because it is. I can only share a limited amount of research. 

You haven't shared any research, just your own opinion. You say you've spent 'months working with research teams' but you've provided no backup to those opinions whatsoever.

&gt;But if nothing else I hope this will make people look **fuehrer** into each party's platform.

That's a hell of a typo.&gt;Why isn't there a party that is socially liberal and fiscally conservative?

They all claim to be 'fiscally conservative'. None of them are. The Conservatives lower taxes but increase spending. The Liberals are generally flat on taxes (with cosmetic increases and decreases) and increase spending. The NDP have no track record, but aren't much different in the promise department than the Liberals this time around.

Both the NDP and Liberals claim to be socially liberal to various degrees. The Conservatives claim not to be, but we still have same sex marriage and abortion after 10 years of their rule, 4 of them as a majority. On any international scale that's pretty 'liberal'.

If a new party came along that makes the same claims of being 'socially liberal and fiscally conservative' the Liberals and NDP will say 'so are we!', no matter how dubious that claim would be. They'd get no vote share as they're competing for the same audience. It's not a winning strategy at the moment.&gt; I don't think we should be comparing Canada internationally if same sex marriage and abortion rights are considered liberal.

[Don't be so sure of that] (https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/06/gay-marriage.jpg&amp;w=1484).

Look at the United States. Huge rifts on same-sex marriage requiring court intervention. Republicans agitating to defund Planned Parenthood.

Look at Canada 15-20 years ago. Abortion massively controversial. No hint that same sex marriage would ever be tolerated.&gt;The liberals did not lose the religious vote. Maybe the ones you know, but the majority I know consider social justice more important than marriage and abortion, and are split between NDP and Liberals

I'm relying on overall statistics, not just people I know.

In 2011 "The NDP drew one out of four of those Canadians who are most religiously devout, while the Liberals attracted 18 per cent." - [Vancouver Sun] (http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/05/09/poll-how-religion-and-ethnicity-shaped-canadas-2011-election/)I wholeheartedly approve. Resistance against incompetent, destructive figureheads is definitely a message that needs to be widely heard in Venezuela.I don't have any animosity towards the NDP (and indeed wouldn't mind it if they had wound up staying ahead) but part of me kind of wants Pat Martin to lose his seat. He's never given me anything but a negative impression as a confrontational hyperpartisan. That, and Liberal candidate Dr. Oulette's [AMA] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/3m4ntg/ama_with_robertfalcon_ouellette/) was pretty interesting, and I appreciated the time he took to write detailed, intelligent responses.We're building slightly watered-down versions of them called the [Harry DeWolf-class] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_DeWolf-class_offshore_patrol_vessel). First steel was cut September 1. The Canadian versions will be 140 tonnes heavier, have conventional propellers instead of azipods (meaning it cannot perform stern icebreaking as the Svalbard can), and is armed with 1x25mm Typhoon Mk38 Mod 2 deck gun vs. the Svalbard's 57mm BOFORS. It's slightly less powerful (2 conventional prop shafts at 4.5MW vs. the Svalbard's 2x5MW azipods) and requires more crew (65 vs. 50 on the Svalbard). The Canadian design can carry a bit more cargo and a larger helicopter, but the Svalbard can carry 2 smaller ones.Interestingly AnyoneButHarper.net has it at a 59% chance of [going Liberal] (http://anyonebutharper.net/riding.php?riding_number=24054). I don't know if I believe that; I personally don't think it's that likely.I don't think a couple of questionable predictions is solid evidence the concept doesn't work. I'd need something with a little more academic vigour behind it to be so certain.&gt;It's not the questionable predictions - it's that people who want to vote strategically can only have imperfect information with which to do so.

Quite True, but then I would argue that's the case for any voter who is not a lifelong adherent to any political party - regardless of their intent on a national scale.Yeah, their prediction is based off of running the model 1,000 times. Running it just once can give some [interesting results] (http://i.imgur.com/PtrC9KA.png).For sure. Monday night sure will be interesting.Yeah, that's why I separated it into its own sentence. Apologies if that was unclear.&gt; If the NDP somehow pulls out a leading majority I guess we can all assume the pollsters have an agenda, or are just incompetent. If the pollsters are right then I guess these supporters are wearing rose colored glasses themselves.

Given that pollsters use election polling to prove their mettle and drum up business from the private sector, distorting polls by virtue of having an 'agenda' would be suicide for their reputation cost them all serious business.

These are mostly the same firms that [predicted the NDP's win in Alberta] (http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/alberta.html) - I can't see how they'd suddenly turn around and hate the federal wing to their own detriment.

Is it possible they're all wrong? Sure, if unlikely. I wouldn't buy for a second that they're expressing an 'agenda', though.Geoff Regan won Halifax West with a decent 7-point margin in 2011 for the Liberals. I foresee him winning re-election by an even wider margin this time around. The NDP challenger doesn't seem inspiring and I expect the Conservative vote has degraded significantly. The Liberals are surging in Atlantic Canada and I expect my riding will ride the wave.Forget the national debt - the biggest debt the federal government has is the debt of trust with First Nations. Some of the FN bills the Conservatives proposed were fairly intelligent (like the education bill) but died because of a lack of trust. Major infrastructure projects face huge hurdles because of a lack of trust.

How do you solve that? You fix things. You fix things and you don't ask for anything in return.

- Poor water quality on a reserve? Fix it. It doesn't matter that this FN didn't file its financial statements.
- Dilapidated, overcrowded housing? Fix it. It doesn't matter that it's dubious if housing is actually a federal responsibility.
- Poor access to health care? Fix it. It doesn't matter that this FN has a chief who made $350K last year.

You go into FN with an attitude of 'how can we help?' You don't worry about whose 'fault' or responsibility stuff is. You keep fixing problem after problem after problem and don't ask for anything in return. It's not cheap and it's not quick, but that's the only way to build trust. Only after a long, arduous process can the federal government begin to approach FN about implementing necessary educational, financial, and in some cases democratic reforms - collaboratively, without imposing anything or blaming anyone.

Anything less is just repeating the same endless cycle of mistrust, leading to wasting everyone's time and money.Yeah, I was out of room in the headline and had to cut something. Still there wasn't much other shore-bombardment naval action going on prior to May 1940, so it's probably reasonably accurate.The objections of the Conservatives here are every bit as self-serving as what they accuse the Liberals of. Despite that, though, I can't help but agree with them about the necessity of a referendum to make such a fundamental change.Do equal amounts of carbon emissions warm the planet less during recessions as compared to boom times?&gt; It would be interesting to hear from Dominic LeBlanc about how Mr. O'Neill or Ms. Beckel are unqualified for the positions. Or he could just do what most people know this is and say that the Liberals want their people in these positions. 

That's wrong. He directly stated that it has nothing to do with their individual merits. The underlying story is 'abuse of process'.

The Conservatives are the ones who have intimated these people are unqualified by assuming no subsequent government would choose to renew their tenures. Where's the call to hold them to account for this?&gt; Then in that case Mr. LeBlanc can take the necessary formal steps to remedy the situation if the Liberal party machine feels that it's right. Attempting to shame them publicly into resigning is a bit much.

It's hardly an attempt to 'shame' them, it's a way to avoid the messy issue of having to fire them by asking them to decline the appointment. If it were an attempt to 'shame' them they'd be barred from re-applying or otherwise blamed for the situation.&gt;Carbon Emissions don't give a fuck. We're going to see a +2C situation over the next 100 years regardless of what happens in alberta in the next 4 years. Its a question of limiting it beyond +2C.

Why does Alberta get a special pass? Every region in the world can make the same argument that temperatures will rise regardless of what they do individually.

&gt;To achieve lasting emission reductions its a question of creating a situation in which regulations survive from government to government. Shouldering the blame for putting 40,000+ people out of work and destroying everyones pensions and property values is not the way to achieve lasting emission reductions.

It's pretty alarmist to say we have to shut down Alberta's oil and gas industry right now, but to limit warming to 2C it is going to have to be shut down by 2060-2080.That wouldn't jive particularly well with the new government's claim to be committed to transparency, would it? Staying silent when confronted with an egregious abuse like this wouldn't exactly instill confidence.&gt; Timing is everything. If they get repealed its been a huge waste of time. Think long term. 

Somehow I don't think Wildrose is going to be a carbon tax cheerleader after an economic recovery.

With some commentators saying oil could stay below $15 for [15 years] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/goldman-sees-15-years-of-weak-crude-as-20-u-s-oil-looms-on-glut) and even the IEA acknowledging the [possibility of a long-term depression in oil prices] (https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo-2015-special-report-energy-climate-change.html) the planet doesn't have time to wait for a return to boom times for the petroleum industry. C-51 can be amended at will. The impact of changing the voting system will be with us for at a bare minimum the duration of the parliament it creates and the effects on governance of whatever makeup this change results in could have on Canada could be profound. This isn't a typical bill, it redefines the relationship between the electorate and their representatives. The closest (but still imperfect) modern analogy is the Quebec separation movement.I think you are referring to C-24, which is to be repealed.I booked a test drive there once. They salesperson I went out with was dour, distracted, and mostly silent. I didn't say anything but I was annoyed... right up until I left the dealership and saw a note on the door saying they'd be closing early to attend the funeral of a coworker.

I felt so awkward I never went back despite liking the car I drove.An arms-length non-partisan super-PBO that reports to parliament - and is the basis for all financial data - wouldn't necessarily be the worst idea in the world. I struggle to think of any major downsides, to be honest. It sure would feed into the Liberals' line about 'transparency'.I wouldn't necessarily want them mixed - an auditor should be its own separate entity that could be used to scrutinize both government programs and the findings of this theoretical super-PBO.&gt; The coalitions plan is to promote integration of Sunni's and Shiites. 

Ambitious plan. Exactly how will the West do that after they've been mortal enemies for almost 1,400 years?&gt; Probably not, but the ones who are against it are sick of being called bigots and xenophobes and thus have been pushed out of the conversation.

Why would this impact poll results?History may not repeat itself but it [sure does rhyme a lot] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/BritishBrothersLeaguePoster%281902%29.jpg).&gt; Yeah, Trump is a nutjob, but so is everyone at the polar opposite end of the spectrum who can't even criticize Islam. 

That's because your target is too broad. You can't make a blanket statement about 1.6 billion people - it's simply not rational.

&gt;There's a vacuum in the middle that needs to be filled by sane moderates. 

Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't make them 'not sane'.&gt;He never said that. Don't put words in people's mouths with this meaningless smear of #NotAllMuslims. It is a completely rational question to ask whether one religious ideology results in disproportionately higher levels of radicalization or conflicts more heavily with Western values than another (say, Buddhism). 

'Islam causes terrorism' is a reductionist argument. Terrorists use Islam, not the other way around, the same as they use any other religion from [Christianity] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Resistance_Army) to [Buddhism] (http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/2/myanmars-buddhist-terrorism-problem.html) to [Hinduism] (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jan/19/india-hindu-terrorism-threat).

Why are there 'disproportionately higher levels of radicalization' with Islam? Because wealthy state actors (like Saudi Arabia) push that agenda on a wealth of destitute people like nowhere else in the world, exploiting violence fueled by centuries of Sunni-Shia sectarian conflict and grievances real and imagined with Israel / the West / etc. 

Blaming 'Islam' absolves these entities of their culpability by suggesting it's some fault of the underlying faith when really it's just being used as a vehicle for a political agenda.&gt;Do you see the gap between what he said and what you jumped to?

I see the absurdity of separating the two, yes.

As I've written elsewhere Islam is just a vehicle for those with agendas to twist conflicts to their own purposes. There's nothing special about Islam being used to fuel terrorism - every religion has been distorted to the same ends.

The only difference with Islam is the concentration of destitute people in one region being exploited by wealthy and/or powerful entities (like Saudi Arabia and Iran) to further their own political agendas.

Pretending it's the fault of 'Islam' while ignoring the motivations of human beings absolves the people who are directing these agendas. It's unhelpful, distracting, and is precisely what they want to happen. We have to stop shielding these people and creating the 'us versus them' mentality they feed on.&gt; Your insistence that to criticize and ideology is to attack and malign anyone who is associated with that ideology precludes any discussion between people who disagree.

Nonsense. I did nothing of the sort. The only 'maligning' going on is in your post - I said nothing about the original poster aside from stating that their criticism was not rational and that 'sane' people can disagree. I laid out in detail why in my followup. You have omitted any response to that in order to criticize me personally.&gt; You really think people's models of the world have no influence on their behaviour? Of course radicals use religion as a tool. They do so because religion, and ideology more generally, is an especially effective way to get people to willingly kill other people. But perhaps this proves the validity of the public's fear. Maybe Islam is an especially effective ideology when it comes to its ability to radicalize a mind. Do you a priori dismiss that some ideologies can be more effective than others at causing radicalization? 

I make no claim as to expertise on world religions. A cursory examination of history and current world events, however, shows that no one religion has a monopoly on urging its adherents to acts of violence. If Islam had some special power in this regard its history would be an order of magnitude more bloody than any other. It simply isn't.

&gt;There are plenty of wealthy state actors in the world. And yet you yourself say Saudi Arabia pushes their agenda "like nowhere else in the world". You say this is driven by centuries of Sunni-Shia sectarian conflict, and yet still refuse to see that perhaps their religious ideology can be playing a causal role in these conflicts. 

Religion absolutely plays a role. It's the underlying doctrine that's contorted to support these various causes. I'm not denying that. I'm simply saying there's nothing special about Islam that gives it some magical power to create radicalization. Other religions - and political ideologies, for that matter - have the same ability.

800 years ago it was the Christian fanaticism of the Crusades. 500 years ago it was factions of Christianity in the Thirty Years' War, one of the bloodiest in history. In the last century ideologies of Communism and Fascism gave rise to the biggest bloodbaths. Today it's Islam. In a 100-500 years it could well be something else.&gt; And I guess Christian fanaticism had nothing to do with the Crusades. All the economic interests of states, yes? Ideology should be viewed as a plausible possible cause. Excluding Islam from consideration today is just politics, not reason.

Ideology is a tool used by people for their own agendas. Sometimes that agenda is in line with the ideology's stated aims and sometimes it isn't. Let's boil it down simply:

- Can ideologies be used to incite people to violence? Yes.
- Is Islam such an ideology? Yes.
- Is Islam exclusively or predominantly prone to such incitement? History suggests no.

Evidence therefore indicates that there's nothing inherently 'broken' about Islam that makes it more or less prone to exploitation than any other religious or political philosophy when it comes to inciting violence. It's just the headline of the day, so we treat it as especially scary, when the lens of history shows it's just the current iteration of the focus of extremism.&gt; You attacked him with a claim he made "a blanket statement about 1.6 billion people" when he did nothing of the kind and made a statement about a belief system.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You then said it was absurd to separate the two.

What is Islam without people to believe in it? Of course it's absurd to separate the two. Any ideology's ability to incite action is wholly dependent on people adhering to it.

&gt;You are the problem because you insist that any critique of Islam is an attack on Muslims. 

What kind of argument begins with 'you are the problem'? How is that not a flagrant Rule 2 violation? How am I supposed to find redress for this obvious personal attack when it is a mod who is levying it against me?

&gt;Or am I mistaken? Are you saying that it's entirely reasonable to critique Islam and say bad things about it and that this is NOT an attack on Muslims?

Of course it's entirely reasonable to critique Islam and say bad things about it. The same is True of Christianity, Buddhism, Communism, Democracy, Capitalism, or any ideology under the sun. That's not what's being discussed here. It's the myth that somehow Islam is unique or distinct in its ability to incite violence when history shows this isn't the case, and Muslims do not merit the special attention being paid them as somehow more prone to violence solely because of their ideology.&gt; You are unwilling or unable to separate critique of an ideology with an attack on the people holding it.

I said absolutely nothing of the sort. Please re-read my previous reply:

&gt;&gt;Of course it's entirely reasonable to critique Islam and say bad things about it. The same is True of Christianity, Buddhism, Communism, Democracy, Capitalism, or any ideology under the sun. That's not what's being discussed here. It's the myth that somehow Islam is unique or distinct in its ability to incite violence when history shows this isn't the case, and Muslims do not merit the special attention being paid them as somehow more prone to violence solely because of their ideology.
&gt; Did the Buddhists in Myanmar cite Buddha's words or teachings while terrorising the Rohingyas or did people who happen to be Buddhists do it for reasons independent of their religious/philosophical beliefs? 

Both, but the former is much more incendiary:

- Straying From the Middle Way: Extremist Buddhist Monks Target Religious Minorities - [Time Magazine] (http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/)
- Buddhist Extremism and the Hypocrisy of 'Religious Violence' - [ABC News Australia] (http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/05/29/4245049.htm)

Are these monks in the 'majority'? No. Are they teaching 'True Buddhism'? Maybe, maybe not, but that's the same sort of argument often used against vitriolic Islamic scholars.

&gt;Even though we all are able to acknowledge the absurdity of such a discussion, it is baffling how so many fail to see how ridiculous the polar opposite reductionist argument is. 

Ideology is a universal constant in mass movements of violence. I make no claims as to know whether Islam is more or less efficacious in rousing the people but history suggests it's not unique or outstanding in that capacity.- "A defence official confirmed a large number of projects were affected by the delay, with funds ending up unspent. Those included the purchase of new maritime helicopters to replace the aging Sea Kings, as well as new army trucks and Arctic patrol ships."

Delaying the replacement of Sea Kings is by no means 'doing something right'. It's unmitigated gall, especially after the hay the Conservatives made out of accusing the previous Liberal government of dragging their heels on the file.&gt;&gt;How about where you said this:

&gt;&gt;    I see the absurdity of separating the two, yes.


You cannot criticize the behaviour of those who practice the Islamic faith and commit acts of violence by blaming the religion and absolving the individual, the demagogue who convinced them to carry out the act of violence, and the organization that financed it.That contradicts what the official quoted above said when they stated the Sea King replacement was 'affected' by this delay. What is your basis for the claim that their statement is inaccurate?No worries, happens to all of us.&gt;I'm not sure if you read the two articles you cited, but neither speaks to the connection between Buddhism and violence because there isn't one. I think you missed my point, so I will try it again. There is nothing in the Buddhist cannon that could even be remotely misconsTrued to promote violence. It simply isn't there. Same goes for other religions such as Jainism. Christianity and Islam cannot say the same. I encourage you to open the holy books and see how far you get before you notice the unfortunate fate for infidels.

Ah, the 'no True Scotsman' argument. Let's see how history bears it out.

- Meet [Nissho Inoue] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissho_Inoue), a self-styled Buddhist preacher (though never ordained) who in 1932 unleashed a wave of assassinations in Japan with the goal of overthrowing the government. They murdered the Prime Minister of Japan in 1932.
- Meet [Phra Kittiwuttho] (https://books.google.ca/books?id=cXORqV4AZjcC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=Phra+Kittiwuttho&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0DLzNucNS2&amp;sig=6R7RBb6yvA7SpApPsz4kl7GuvKM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-74Gl1NLJAhXLaD4KHfZYCFQQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Phra%20Kittiwuttho&amp;f=False), conservative Thai nationalist monk. He advocated for the death of all communists in the 1970s, saying it was consistent with Buddhism because 'such bestial types are not complete persons'.
- Meet the [Buddhist Power Force] (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/opinion/sri-lankas-violent-buddhists.html?_r=0) of Sri Lanka. They and their counterparts have the support of hardline nationalist monks advocating violence, especially towards the Tamil minorities.

The basic tenets of Buddhism do indeed speak to nonviolence to a far greater degree than any Abrahamic religion. That does not mean that people have not twisted the Buddhist faith to incite violence.

&gt;Certainly it is being used for a political agenda and the political context, including the atrocious acts by the US over the last 15 years, is an extremely important factor in the development of ISIS, but Islam is not off the hook as you say. In fact, what makes Islam particularly unique at this moment is the widespread belief in the Quran's scriptual inerrancy. When a holy book, which represents the perfect word of god has passages that condone violence, compared to one's that don't (Buddhism), there is a qualitative difference in the potential outcomes that could arise from them. Especially, as just mentioned, if it is maintained that the book is infallible. 

Islam is as those who interpret it wish it to be, no different than the Buddhist examples before. The Islamic advocates for peace, however, rarely make many headlines.Negative things Duffy says about the Conservative party should be treated with a high level of skepticism - after all, he generally stands to personally benefit by discrediting their conduct. The things he said absolutely should not be taken as True just because he said them.

By the same token, though, the possibility that his claims are True is not absolutely zero and some further investigation is warranted.-  "And what he's told me is that it's important for him as he remains a member of Parliament to be here for the important votes that matter to his constituents."

I wonder what criteria are used to determine which are 'important votes' for Harper to be present and which are 'unimportant votes' he feels he can skip out on. He's not the leader any more, nor even in the shadow cabinet - what's stopping him from attending every vote?I'm the opposite. I'm trying to get not-hyped and keep my expectations low so that I am not constantly trying to compare the movie to sky-high expectations. The tone of the trailers so far has been excellent and it's been difficult not to watch them more than once each.Overly-long [source video] (https://youtu.be/CZVht5E6sVM).Clearly a lukewarm satire site, but here are some better nominees:

- A bronze, gold-covered statue of Turkmenistan's quasi-dictator [Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/horse-turkmenistan-president-statute-berdymukhamedov) perched atop a '20-foot marble cliff', in an effort to outdo...
- The gold-plated statue of his predecessor [Saparmurat Niyazov] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_Monument) atop a 'neutrality monument', which also had a snazzy motorized dias to always rotate the Leader to face the sun. Berdymukhamedov moved the monument and sadly it no longer rotates.
- Or how about the [African Renaissance Monument] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Renaissance_Monument) in Senegal. Built by the skilled workers of North Korea, a 49-foot tall bronze statue depicting 'a young woman, a man, and held aloft on the man's raised left arm, a child resolutely pointing west towards the sea?'
- Speaking of North Korea, it's replete with contenders like the [Juche Tower] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche_Tower), the giant [Arch of Reuinification] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Reunification), or the enormous [Arch of Triumph] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Triumph_%28Pyongyang%29).

Vancouver with its little steam clock needs to step up its game.Man, if the floor in fact ever becomes lava the Indian Army is well-trained to deal with it.Trudeau's attitude bucks the predominant trend in Europe and the perceived attitudes in the United States. 

There are perfectly fair and valid reasons to argue against increased levels of refugee resettlement from this conflict but many of those on that side of the argument most likely to make headlines have been saying some pretty vitriolic things. That's the nature of media - the most shocking stuff gets attention, which sadly drowns out valid points and informed debate. Trudeau's sunny, everything-is-going-to-be-OK attitude also isn't necessarily a great starter for that debate either, but I guess it's an attention-grabber just for being the antithesis to that vitriol.&gt;I don't think a very strong argument can be made for different insurance rates based on usage time.

Usage time is at the core of risk. The more time you're on the road the greater your chance of an accident simply by virtue of being exposed to more traffic.

&gt;I mentioned in my other post that there are other occupations where people drive hundreds of more hours than an average urban worker but face no difference in insurance. My example was a vet who would drive all over a province to visit different farms. 

Sure there are outliers, but the rates are based on average drivers. Many insurers offer reduced rates for low-mileage drivers.

&gt;I hurdle I do see is the liability for passengers in the case of an accident. That is something that could definitely be used to leverage different insurance rates.

Sure, that's another factor. Insurance policies are generally specifically written to exclude paying passengers (though they tend to allow the recovery of expenses for things like car pools).Even if this is so then consider that the 40,000 is an overly generous population pool.

There were two types of roles that soldiers deployed to Afghanistan fulfilled - combat units and support. In 2009, for instance, Canada had 2,500 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which 1,200 were in combat roles and 1,300 in support roles. Now the data the Globe obtained didn't have this degree of detail, but it is far more likely that those who took their own lives were part of units that were deployed in combat roles, which would greatly increase the rate. You could even drill down further and make the reasonable supposition that these individuals were likely part of combat units that actually saw combat / incurred casualties / incurred some sort of trauma. Couple that with the Globe's disclaimer that the number of suicides they uncovered likely does not include all of them and there are reasonable grounds to believe the suicide rate among deployed soldiers most susceptible to psychological trauma is far higher than the general population. Either way a detailed investigation is warranted.Syrian refugees are not here for our benefit. They are here for their protection. Canada is obligated to carry out this duty under the 1951 and 1967 treaties on refugees that we are a signatory to - as is all of Europe, for that matter.

Refugees are also not permanent residents, as recent history has shown a significant number of them will return home should the conflict be resolved. Vietnam was the exception to this rule as the new regime remained hostile to those who fled for generations.Why? What is the processing capacity for refugees? Where did you come up with that number? Can you cite your source for it?Wynne won a majority mandate from the people of Ontario in a free and fair election. Like her or not she has every legitimate right under the Constitution to take this action.Prior to this conflict Syria had the most educated population in the Middle East outside of Israel. The literacy rate is [86%] (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS/countries/SY?display=graph). That a fifth of the population has a 'pathetically low' literacy rate is not statistically possible.That is an either-or fallacy. Canada is wealthy enough to address both problems at once.Here is the [aforementioned earlier arrest] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong/comments/3pidya/loyal_imperial_soldiers_capture_new_canadian/) from the databanks.

Here he is [as a child] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/article4568920.ece/BINARY/w620/CPT745.280900C.JPG) (on the right), and here's an interview from the [Ottawa Comic Con] (https://youtu.be/2k057-AmLL4) where he details his love for the Empire Strikes Back.Even if Trudeau ratifies the TPP it is possible that the negative aspects of it with respect to copyright, patents, etc. can be addressed in side letters to modify the deal. I'm not saying it will happen, just throwing that out there.I would like to see Trudeau advocate for side letters to exclude Canada from the more contentious copyright / patent / etc. clauses in TPP. If we can cut out those sorts of clauses the deal will be more palpable.I really hope that since we cut them loose from the contract (and they own the ship) that we aren't on the hook for another dime to them. I further hope Bay Ferries uses a more sensible vessel for the route - and they make the destination Boston, not Portland.No, not a modification to TPP, but rather a side deal that affects only the countries participating. Canada has reportedly already [negotiated a lot of them] (http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/numerous-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-trade-agreement-officials-1.2603645) and there's no reason we cannot negotiate more.&gt;When Bay Ferries was running The Cat, all they asked for was $2.5 mil a year. Dexter killed it, it went a few years without it, the MacNeil started it from scratch again. 

Well, Nova Star was a tag team effort from Dexter and MacNeil. [Dexter chose Nova Star] (http://www.theforecaster.net/maine-company-wins-chance-to-launch-new-ferry-service-between-portland-nova-scotia/) to run it and MacNeil signed the contract. Neither one of them comes out smelling like a rose from this.

&gt;I think it could be profitable of done right and with the right ship. The Nova Star was a political stunt that went very wrong. They are bring back Bay Ferries for another go. I just hope they get the right ship. 

If it were up to me I'd have Bay Ferries run the relatively new [MV Fundy Rose] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Fundy_Rose) on the Digby-Saint John route one day then the Yarmouth-Portland route the second day, and run the Yarmouth-Portland route on the weekends until there's enough demand to justify adding a second ship.

Another option would be to get a second ship but run it from Yarmouth-Boston instead, but that would be a lot pricier.&gt;Yeah he did choose the Nova Star and it was obviously the wrong decision. I think they were just trying to get any boat running. However MacNeil could have done a much better job at overseeing it. 

For sure. Like I said, neither one of them handled it well.

&gt;I also agree on the Yarmouth to Boston point. I've always thought that would be a better route and would probably turn out much better. For some reason that never seems to be an option thought.

I only imagine port facilities in Boston would be vastly more expensive than in Portland. MBTA has [ferry terminals] (http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/boats/) but none of them are equipped to handle cars. Portland still had its facility from when the Cat was running.So far the weight seems to be for those who want to lift the reduce or lift the ban:

&gt;Fair election? Do you remember all the illegal 3rd party signs from working families coalition with outright Falsehoods about Tim hudak? 

'Illegal' is inflammatory for signs that contravene municipal bylaws. If you don't want 3rd parties in Ontario elections then change their laws, but that group has a [legal right to exist] (http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/25/ontario_tories_lose_legal_fight_to_working_families_coalition_of_unions.html).


&gt;And now a 7m paper trail back to the teachers unions, who, surprise surprise gave money to the WFC (money they got from the OLP)?

Do you have evidence that this influenced the outcome of the election?


&gt;There is nothing free and fair about it. Using tax dollars to fund a 3rd party that engages in illegal campaign activities and attack ads on your parties behalf is an affront to democracy.

Please provide the court case or auditor's report where this is established. Otherwise it borders on a conspiracy theory.

Was anyone in the polling place monitoring your ballot? Were armed men intimidating you into voting a certain way? We're the results tampered with? Of course not. Could the election laws be improved? Probably, but to call it an unfree and unfair election is ludicrous.I don't have a "team" and I have no love for the Wynne government. I don't even live in Ontario. Your assertions of electoral fraud so severe as to call the past provincial government are as unfounded as someone saying the 2011 federal election was fraudulent because of the illegal actions on behalf of the Conservative party.

This isn't about partisanship. Calm down.
&gt;I still disagree with you regarding 3rd parties influencing outcomes, especially when there are "questionable" direct transfers of taxpayer funds to these entities (even if there is an intermediate) that spend large down the stretch of the election.

I'm not saying they don't have some influence and I'm not saying they're a good thing, but under Ontario law they are legal currently. I haven't seen any direct evidence of taxpayer money going to them either. 

All I am saying is that their efforts do not meet the threshold of making the election unfree and unfair. If they did not exist the outcome of the last Ontario election likely wouldn't be massively different - Hudak and Horwath adeptly shot themselves in the foot at every opportunity.Canada already has negotiated [at least 15 side letters] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/several-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-pact-federal-officials-say/article26763531/) to modify TPP. Japan has [18] (http://www.prosperousamerica.org/japan_has_18_side_letters_to_tpp_including_on_autos_ntms_rice_with_u_s). It's very much not 'take it or leave it'.

*Fine, downvote citation-backed facts because you don't like them.I heavily favour dispensing with FPTP and introducing either STV or MMP. I also am fairly adamant that a referendum is necessary to ensure legitimacy, as the relationship between the electorate and their representatives is a fundamental tenet of democracy.

New Zealand managed to adopt MMP with two referendums, and when those who opposed MMP won power they had to hold their own referendum to try and repeal it. They failed and MMP remained. If such a thing were to happen in Canada the party wishing to overturn whatever system we wound up with would be under no such constraints.&gt;Look at the projected quality of life in Sweden. Why is it going straight down?

Where's your source for that projection?The courts would, I think, take a dim view of the wink-wink-nudge-nudge 'here's our Senatorial election results but they're totally not binding' approach. Once every Senator that's selected by these elections winds up being appointed the argument that the results aren't binding loses all its merit.And yet New Zealand managed to survive not one, not two, but three referendums on choosing, implementing, and keeping MMP respectively.

I'm an ardent supporter of ditching FPTP but I also firmly believe we need a referendum to do so. A party will win power eventually that wants to return to FPTP. That happened in New Zealand. They had to have a referendum there to undo it because there was one to implement it. That referendum failed and MMP remained. 

Without a referendum any future party could revert to FPTP with the stroke of a pen.Nova Star Cruises purchased the MV Nova Star from ST Marine (the builder) in 2014. If you have a marinetraffic.com account you can see the ownership history [here] (http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/311000199).Luckily the MV Nova Star is owned by Nova Star Cruises. Since the contract has been terminated between the province and the company I can't imagine the province will be on the hook for this.

There's plenty of blame to go around for how badly this went. The previous NDP government [chose Nova Star as the provider for this service] (http://www.theforecaster.net/maine-company-wins-chance-to-launch-new-ferry-service-between-portland-nova-scotia/) while the current Liberal government was the one to actually sign the contract.

Going with Bay Ferries seems to be a wiser alternative that should have been explored earlier if this service actually has merit.Mexico: No longer part of North America.

Also, what the hell is going on in the background of these images with the pale grey Comic Sans text and drawings?Free and fair referendums are the gold standard of consultation. They set the bar very high for undoing any reform passed by virtue of them. For something as critical as an electoral system I maintain they are necessary.What impact does the introduction of widespread tolls have on the economy of a region? Is there any evidence of reduced economic activity in an area that requires more tolls to reach vs. an area that can be reached for no / fewer tolls?Happy to help. It's why Nova Star could look for winter work for the ship without needing anyone's permission - they had fulfilled the seasonal contract with the province and had no other obligations.I believe that was the situation prior to 2014. Either way the good news is that the province is under no obligation to keep using that pricey ship.Sure, theoretically the notion seems to balance out, but I am more interested in if there has ever been any actual study done to research the impact of widespread tolls on economic activity in a region. Sort of similar to this [European report] (http://www.cedr.fr/home/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/2009/e_Road%20pricing.pdf) perhaps less Euro-centric.

[This paper] (http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2010_11_Impacts_Toll_West_Virginia_REMI_Approach.pdf) from West Virginia forecasts increased economic activity from increased tolls but is a little light on details and is forward-looking. Same with [this one] (http://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kockelman/public_html/TRB06SukumarTRs.pdf) from Texas. &gt;There is only one possible solution. Reposess all these houses and kick out all of these foreign "investors" (more like criminals). Anyone who resists will be shot. 

Nothing signals to the world that Canada is a nation that respects the rule of law like seizure of legally-acquired property and threats of execution. The Venezuela model isn't panning out so well down there, I'd rather not import it here.

There are plenty of other solutions that don't involve violence: a separate, significantly-higher tax rate for non-residents, for instance. Phase it in over 3 years for existing property owners, hit new ones with it immediately. That will also generate resources for affordable housing for the most vulnerable without having to, you know, shoot anyone.'Roosevelt would like the secrets of Radar. They are offering food and gold for 30 turns.'[5,000 more people per year] (https://www.liberal.ca/liberal-immigration-plan-focused-on-family-reunification-middle-class-growth/) is not a statistically significant number of individuals, even if all of them were seniors. The objections raised by the Fraser Institute are a bit overinflated. The concern is that foreign investors are buying up these properties as an investment. A large number are never going to live in them - they will hold them vacant and sell them later, possibly to someone else doing the same thing.

This isn't a problem with something like a share of a company, but real estate is different. They're driving prices up beyond the reach of people who actually live in the city. They pay property tax, sure, but they don't pay income tax or sales tax on purchases there. They don't contribute to the local economy beyond the initial sale and some property maintenance fees. It's a real hollowing out of the tax base and community economy for no real gain.

You've got a finite supply of land in a densely-populated region like Vancouver and leaving huge chunks of it vacant really screws with municipal planning too. Sure you have tax revenue coming in, but how big do you build your schools? Do utilities stop investing so much in increasing capacity because no one is living in these houses? What happens if people suddenly start moving in in droves and you're getting no new tax revenue?
Some do, but it's a lot of hassle for someone not living in the same country, much less the same continent. By the time you pay a management firm to take care of everything locally the net returns are significantly diminished and you still have liability if the management firm screws something up or something else goes wrong. Many seem to want a 'carefree' investment and see renting as an unnecessary complication that doesn't warrant the additional incremental revenue.&gt;property tax? or land transfer tax?

Time to bring out the old meme of [why can't we have both?] (http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-03/26/19/imagebuzz/webdr05/anigif_optimized-29941-1427413465-1.gif)

Charge a fat rate to non-residents, and charge them a fat tax to transfer it to anyone. Drop some ice water on the land rush fire.For sure, but paying someone to cut the lawn and do an interior inspection once a year costs a whole lot less than paying someone to be a proxy landlord.Vacant property insurance is slightly different from regular property insurance. The coverage is less and (generally) the inspection requirements are less stringent than a regular property being left unattended for a period.

Just a small handful of the wealth of articles out there that will answer your question in exhaustive detail from many independent sources. Happy reading.This article is problematic. There has been no new announcement, it's just reiterating the Liberal platform and passing it off as a new story. I've little doubt that the Liberals actually will carry through with it as the article says, but as it stands it's a little misleading to declare it so before it's officially announced.The table uses data directly from OP's image.Yeah, that's why I didn't include it in my original post - there are too many variables and I couldn't find a reliable 'average'. I take no responsibility for the FP's calculation for the very correct reasons you point out.What's with the hostility, friend? I don't live in Ontario so I really don't care who you elect.[OECD] (http://www.oecd.org/economy/germany-economic-forecast-summary.htm) and [Deutsche Bundesbank] (https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/BBK/2015/2015_06_05_bundesbank_projection.html) and [Germany themselves] (http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/__pr/P__Wash/2015/10/15-Economic-Growth.html?archive=1992696) indicate a growing economy for the next several years.

&gt;I'd imagine...

Okay then.

&gt;Those small growth numbers won't out run inflation and growth over the next year is not indicative of current events today but what was going on up to 5 years ago.

5 years ago? Germany's update is a few weeks old. 

Let's look at someone [who has studied the impact of refugees] (http://bruegel.org/2015/10/how-will-refugees-affect-european-economies/), citing the Economist and OECD:

- "**Their overall conclusion is that migration is \u201cneither a significant gain nor drain for the public purse\u201d**"
- "Mark Schieritz looks into the debate of how much refugees will cost Germany and cites estimates from RWI Essen, which amount to 10 bn EUR for 2015, and should be even higher for 2016. This is similar to the estimates from the German government, which estimates costs to amount to 12000 Eur per refugee per year. Nevertheless, despite the extra-spending related to the refugee crisis, the German budget surplus will rise from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP in 2015. Schieritz explains this by stating that the extra-spending does not vanish in a black hole, but is actually stimulating internal demand in Germany. To what extent refugees will then be able to contribute to the sustainability of the welfare state in Germany will depend on many factors, including their ease of access to the labour market."There's definitely a maximum threshold for even the most prosperous nation, but it seems that the capacity for the social safety net to accommodate them is a barrier that would be hit long before economic concerns start to be a serious factor.

It is True that migrants have historically been [over-represented in crime statistics in Germany] (http://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/duenkel/Germany_youngMig.pdf) of 2.7:1 of registered migrants vs. native Germans (this includes all forms of migration, not just refugees) - this drops to 2.4:1 if crimes that Germans are incapable of committing (like immigration fraud) are removed from the analysis. The study period was from 1981-2002 and so does not capture this latest inflow, which may skew the numbers higher or lower.It's on the other side of the country and their logo [doesn't really look like KOD's] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/king-of-donair-trademark-1.3296910).

Usage time is at the core of risk. The more time you're on the road the greater your chance of an accident simply by virtue of being exposed to more traffic.

&gt;I mentioned in my other post that there are other occupations where people drive hundreds of more hours than an average urban worker but face no difference in insurance. My example was a vet who would drive all over a province to visit different farms. 

Sure there are outliers, but the rates are based on average drivers. Many insurers offer reduced rates for low-mileage drivers.

&gt;I hurdle I do see is the liability for passengers in the case of an accident. That is something that could definitely be used to leverage different insurance rates.

Sure, that's another factor. Insurance policies are generally specifically written to exclude paying passengers (though they tend to allow the recovery of expenses for things like car pools).Even if this is so then consider that the 40,000 is an overly generous population pool.

There were two types of roles that soldiers deployed to Afghanistan fulfilled - combat units and support. In 2009, for instance, Canada had 2,500 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which 1,200 were in combat roles and 1,300 in support roles. Now the data the Globe obtained didn't have this degree of detail, but it is far more likely that those who took their own lives were part of units that were deployed in combat roles, which would greatly increase the rate. You could even drill down further and make the reasonable supposition that these individuals were likely part of combat units that actually saw combat / incurred casualties / incurred some sort of trauma. Couple that with the Globe's disclaimer that the number of suicides they uncovered likely does not include all of them and there are reasonable grounds to believe the suicide rate among deployed soldiers most susceptible to psychological trauma is far higher than the general population. Either way a detailed investigation is warranted.Syrian refugees are not here for our benefit. They are here for their protection. Canada is obligated to carry out this duty under the 1951 and 1967 treaties on refugees that we are a signatory to - as is all of Europe, for that matter.

Refugees are also not permanent residents, as recent history has shown a significant number of them will return home should the conflict be resolved. Vietnam was the exception to this rule as the new regime remained hostile to those who fled for generations.Why? What is the processing capacity for refugees? Where did you come up with that number? Can you cite your source for it?Wynne won a majority mandate from the people of Ontario in a free and fair election. Like her or not she has every legitimate right under the Constitution to take this action.Prior to this conflict Syria had the most educated population in the Middle East outside of Israel. The literacy rate is [86%] (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS/countries/SY?display=graph). That a fifth of the population has a 'pathetically low' literacy rate is not statistically possible.That is an either-or fallacy. Canada is wealthy enough to address both problems at once.Here is the [aforementioned earlier arrest] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong/comments/3pidya/loyal_imperial_soldiers_capture_new_canadian/) from the databanks.

Here he is [as a child] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/article4568920.ece/BINARY/w620/CPT745.280900C.JPG) (on the right), and here's an interview from the [Ottawa Comic Con] (https://youtu.be/2k057-AmLL4) where he details his love for the Empire Strikes Back.Even if Trudeau ratifies the TPP it is possible that the negative aspects of it with respect to copyright, patents, etc. can be addressed in side letters to modify the deal. I'm not saying it will happen, just throwing that out there.I would like to see Trudeau advocate for side letters to exclude Canada from the more contentious copyright / patent / etc. clauses in TPP. If we can cut out those sorts of clauses the deal will be more palpable.I really hope that since we cut them loose from the contract (and they own the ship) that we aren't on the hook for another dime to them. I further hope Bay Ferries uses a more sensible vessel for the route - and they make the destination Boston, not Portland.No, not a modification to TPP, but rather a side deal that affects only the countries participating. Canada has reportedly already [negotiated a lot of them] (http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/numerous-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-trade-agreement-officials-1.2603645) and there's no reason we cannot negotiate more.&gt;When Bay Ferries was running The Cat, all they asked for was $2.5 mil a year. Dexter killed it, it went a few years without it, the MacNeil started it from scratch again. 

Well, Nova Star was a tag team effort from Dexter and MacNeil. [Dexter chose Nova Star] (http://www.theforecaster.net/maine-company-wins-chance-to-launch-new-ferry-service-between-portland-nova-scotia/) to run it and MacNeil signed the contract. Neither one of them comes out smelling like a rose from this.

&gt;I think it could be profitable of done right and with the right ship. The Nova Star was a political stunt that went very wrong. They are bring back Bay Ferries for another go. I just hope they get the right ship. 

If it were up to me I'd have Bay Ferries run the relatively new [MV Fundy Rose] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Fundy_Rose) on the Digby-Saint John route one day then the Yarmouth-Portland route the second day, and run the Yarmouth-Portland route on the weekends until there's enough demand to justify adding a second ship.

Another option would be to get a second ship but run it from Yarmouth-Boston instead, but that would be a lot pricier.&gt;Yeah he did choose the Nova Star and it was obviously the wrong decision. I think they were just trying to get any boat running. However MacNeil could have done a much better job at overseeing it. 

For sure. Like I said, neither one of them handled it well.

&gt;I also agree on the Yarmouth to Boston point. I've always thought that would be a better route and would probably turn out much better. For some reason that never seems to be an option thought.

I only imagine port facilities in Boston would be vastly more expensive than in Portland. MBTA has [ferry terminals] (http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/boats/) but none of them are equipped to handle cars. Portland still had its facility from when the Cat was running.So far the weight seems to be for those who want to lift the reduce or lift the ban:

&gt;Fair election? Do you remember all the illegal 3rd party signs from working families coalition with outright Falsehoods about Tim hudak? 

'Illegal' is inflammatory for signs that contravene municipal bylaws. If you don't want 3rd parties in Ontario elections then change their laws, but that group has a [legal right to exist] (http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/25/ontario_tories_lose_legal_fight_to_working_families_coalition_of_unions.html).


&gt;And now a 7m paper trail back to the teachers unions, who, surprise surprise gave money to the WFC (money they got from the OLP)?

Do you have evidence that this influenced the outcome of the election?


&gt;There is nothing free and fair about it. Using tax dollars to fund a 3rd party that engages in illegal campaign activities and attack ads on your parties behalf is an affront to democracy.

Please provide the court case or auditor's report where this is established. Otherwise it borders on a conspiracy theory.

Was anyone in the polling place monitoring your ballot? Were armed men intimidating you into voting a certain way? We're the results tampered with? Of course not. Could the election laws be improved? Probably, but to call it an unfree and unfair election is ludicrous.I don't have a "team" and I have no love for the Wynne government. I don't even live in Ontario. Your assertions of electoral fraud so severe as to call the past provincial government are as unfounded as someone saying the 2011 federal election was fraudulent because of the illegal actions on behalf of the Conservative party.

This isn't about partisanship. Calm down.
&gt;I still disagree with you regarding 3rd parties influencing outcomes, especially when there are "questionable" direct transfers of taxpayer funds to these entities (even if there is an intermediate) that spend large down the stretch of the election.

I'm not saying they don't have some influence and I'm not saying they're a good thing, but under Ontario law they are legal currently. I haven't seen any direct evidence of taxpayer money going to them either. 

All I am saying is that their efforts do not meet the threshold of making the election unfree and unfair. If they did not exist the outcome of the last Ontario election likely wouldn't be massively different - Hudak and Horwath adeptly shot themselves in the foot at every opportunity.Canada already has negotiated [at least 15 side letters] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/several-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-pact-federal-officials-say/article26763531/) to modify TPP. Japan has [18] (http://www.prosperousamerica.org/japan_has_18_side_letters_to_tpp_including_on_autos_ntms_rice_with_u_s). It's very much not 'take it or leave it'.

*Fine, downvote citation-backed facts because you don't like them.I heavily favour dispensing with FPTP and introducing either STV or MMP. I also am fairly adamant that a referendum is necessary to ensure legitimacy, as the relationship between the electorate and their representatives is a fundamental tenet of democracy.

New Zealand managed to adopt MMP with two referendums, and when those who opposed MMP won power they had to hold their own referendum to try and repeal it. They failed and MMP remained. If such a thing were to happen in Canada the party wishing to overturn whatever system we wound up with would be under no such constraints.&gt;Look at the projected quality of life in Sweden. Why is it going straight down?

Where's your source for that projection?The courts would, I think, take a dim view of the wink-wink-nudge-nudge 'here's our Senatorial election results but they're totally not binding' approach. Once every Senator that's selected by these elections winds up being appointed the argument that the results aren't binding loses all its merit.And yet New Zealand managed to survive not one, not two, but three referendums on choosing, implementing, and keeping MMP respectively.

I'm an ardent supporter of ditching FPTP but I also firmly believe we need a referendum to do so. A party will win power eventually that wants to return to FPTP. That happened in New Zealand. They had to have a referendum there to undo it because there was one to implement it. That referendum failed and MMP remained. 

Without a referendum any future party could revert to FPTP with the stroke of a pen.Nova Star Cruises purchased the MV Nova Star from ST Marine (the builder) in 2014. If you have a marinetraffic.com account you can see the ownership history [here] (http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/311000199).Luckily the MV Nova Star is owned by Nova Star Cruises. Since the contract has been terminated between the province and the company I can't imagine the province will be on the hook for this.

There's plenty of blame to go around for how badly this went. The previous NDP government [chose Nova Star as the provider for this service] (http://www.theforecaster.net/maine-company-wins-chance-to-launch-new-ferry-service-between-portland-nova-scotia/) while the current Liberal government was the one to actually sign the contract.

Going with Bay Ferries seems to be a wiser alternative that should have been explored earlier if this service actually has merit.Mexico: No longer part of North America.

Also, what the hell is going on in the background of these images with the pale grey Comic Sans text and drawings?Free and fair referendums are the gold standard of consultation. They set the bar very high for undoing any reform passed by virtue of them. For something as critical as an electoral system I maintain they are necessary.What impact does the introduction of widespread tolls have on the economy of a region? Is there any evidence of reduced economic activity in an area that requires more tolls to reach vs. an area that can be reached for no / fewer tolls?Happy to help. It's why Nova Star could look for winter work for the ship without needing anyone's permission - they had fulfilled the seasonal contract with the province and had no other obligations.I believe that was the situation prior to 2014. Either way the good news is that the province is under no obligation to keep using that pricey ship.Sure, theoretically the notion seems to balance out, but I am more interested in if there has ever been any actual study done to research the impact of widespread tolls on economic activity in a region. Sort of similar to this [European report] (http://www.cedr.fr/home/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/2009/e_Road%20pricing.pdf) perhaps less Euro-centric.

[This paper] (http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2010_11_Impacts_Toll_West_Virginia_REMI_Approach.pdf) from West Virginia forecasts increased economic activity from increased tolls but is a little light on details and is forward-looking. Same with [this one] (http://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kockelman/public_html/TRB06SukumarTRs.pdf) from Texas. &gt;There is only one possible solution. Reposess all these houses and kick out all of these foreign "investors" (more like criminals). Anyone who resists will be shot. 

Nothing signals to the world that Canada is a nation that respects the rule of law like seizure of legally-acquired property and threats of execution. The Venezuela model isn't panning out so well down there, I'd rather not import it here.

There are plenty of other solutions that don't involve violence: a separate, significantly-higher tax rate for non-residents, for instance. Phase it in over 3 years for existing property owners, hit new ones with it immediately. That will also generate resources for affordable housing for the most vulnerable without having to, you know, shoot anyone.'Roosevelt would like the secrets of Radar. They are offering food and gold for 30 turns.'[5,000 more people per year] (https://www.liberal.ca/liberal-immigration-plan-focused-on-family-reunification-middle-class-growth/) is not a statistically significant number of individuals, even if all of them were seniors. The objections raised by the Fraser Institute are a bit overinflated. The concern is that foreign investors are buying up these properties as an investment. A large number are never going to live in them - they will hold them vacant and sell them later, possibly to someone else doing the same thing.

This isn't a problem with something like a share of a company, but real estate is different. They're driving prices up beyond the reach of people who actually live in the city. They pay property tax, sure, but they don't pay income tax or sales tax on purchases there. They don't contribute to the local economy beyond the initial sale and some property maintenance fees. It's a real hollowing out of the tax base and community economy for no real gain.

You've got a finite supply of land in a densely-populated region like Vancouver and leaving huge chunks of it vacant really screws with municipal planning too. Sure you have tax revenue coming in, but how big do you build your schools? Do utilities stop investing so much in increasing capacity because no one is living in these houses? What happens if people suddenly start moving in in droves and you're getting no new tax revenue?
Some do, but it's a lot of hassle for someone not living in the same country, much less the same continent. By the time you pay a management firm to take care of everything locally the net returns are significantly diminished and you still have liability if the management firm screws something up or something else goes wrong. Many seem to want a 'carefree' investment and see renting as an unnecessary complication that doesn't warrant the additional incremental revenue.&gt;property tax? or land transfer tax?

Time to bring out the old meme of [why can't we have both?] (http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-03/26/19/imagebuzz/webdr05/anigif_optimized-29941-1427413465-1.gif)

Charge a fat rate to non-residents, and charge them a fat tax to transfer it to anyone. Drop some ice water on the land rush fire.For sure, but paying someone to cut the lawn and do an interior inspection once a year costs a whole lot less than paying someone to be a proxy landlord.Vacant property insurance is slightly different from regular property insurance. The coverage is less and (generally) the inspection requirements are less stringent than a regular property being left unattended for a period.

Just a small handful of the wealth of articles out there that will answer your question in exhaustive detail from many independent sources. Happy reading.This article is problematic. There has been no new announcement, it's just reiterating the Liberal platform and passing it off as a new story. I've little doubt that the Liberals actually will carry through with it as the article says, but as it stands it's a little misleading to declare it so before it's officially announced.The table uses data directly from OP's image.Yeah, that's why I didn't include it in my original post - there are too many variables and I couldn't find a reliable 'average'. I take no responsibility for the FP's calculation for the very correct reasons you point out.What's with the hostility, friend? I don't live in Ontario so I really don't care who you elect.[OECD] (http://www.oecd.org/economy/germany-economic-forecast-summary.htm) and [Deutsche Bundesbank] (https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/BBK/2015/2015_06_05_bundesbank_projection.html) and [Germany themselves] (http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/__pr/P__Wash/2015/10/15-Economic-Growth.html?archive=1992696) indicate a growing economy for the next several years.

Okay then.

&gt;Those small growth numbers won't out run inflation and growth over the next year is not indicative of current events today but what was going on up to 5 years ago.

5 years ago? Germany's update is a few weeks old. 

Let's look at someone [who has studied the impact of refugees] (http://bruegel.org/2015/10/how-will-refugees-affect-european-economies/), citing the Economist and OECD:

- "**Their overall conclusion is that migration is \u201cneither a significant gain nor drain for the public purse\u201d**"
- "Mark Schieritz looks into the debate of how much refugees will cost Germany and cites estimates from RWI Essen, which amount to 10 bn EUR for 2015, and should be even higher for 2016. This is similar to the estimates from the German government, which estimates costs to amount to 12000 Eur per refugee per year. Nevertheless, despite the extra-spending related to the refugee crisis, the German budget surplus will rise from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP in 2015. Schieritz explains this by stating that the extra-spending does not vanish in a black hole, but is actually stimulating internal demand in Germany. To what extent refugees will then be able to contribute to the sustainability of the welfare state in Germany will depend on many factors, including their ease of access to the labour market."There's definitely a maximum threshold for even the most prosperous nation, but it seems that the capacity for the social safety net to accommodate them is a barrier that would be hit long before economic concerns start to be a serious factor.

It is True that migrants have historically been [over-represented in crime statistics in Germany] (http://www.rsf.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/lehrstuehle/duenkel/Germany_youngMig.pdf) of 2.7:1 of registered migrants vs. native Germans (this includes all forms of migration, not just refugees) - this drops to 2.4:1 if crimes that Germans are incapable of committing (like immigration fraud) are removed from the analysis. The study period was from 1981-2002 and so does not capture this latest inflow, which may skew the numbers higher or lower.It's on the other side of the country and their logo [doesn't really look like KOD's] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/king-of-donair-trademark-1.3296910).

- Sydney to Halifax [400km] (http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/about/business_plans/BPlan_2012Ch6_OpMaintCosts.pdf)
- For comparison, Montreal to Ottawa to Toronto is [649km] (https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/Montreal,+QC/Toronto,+ON/@44.5729171,-77.5943561,8z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x4cc91a541c64b70d:0x654e3138211fefef!2m2!1d-73.567256!2d45.5016889!3m4!1m2!1d-75.6717747!2d45.4023937!3s0x4cce0593731dd5a9:0x31490dc80fadbb3!1m5!1m1!1s0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477!2m2!1d-79.3831843!2d43.653226!3e0)
- The absolute minimum cost of a Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto high-speed rail corridor is [$4 billion] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/high-speed-rail-belongs-in-liberals-infrastructure-discussion/article27059566/). At our distance of 400km, this line will cost us a minimum of $2.5 billion dollars.
- With operating costs about [$200,000/mile/year] (http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/about/business_plans/BPlan_2012Ch6_OpMaintCosts.pdf), we will also pay well over $50 million every year just to maintain it, as that estimate is based on snow-free California.
- The population of the CBRM is [97,000] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Breton_Regional_Municipality)
- There are [414,000] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia) people in HRM. Our total serviced population is now 511,000. Assume a stop in Truro and add 12,000 people to that for 523,000.
- There are 5.5M people in the GTA, 1.2M in Ottawa, and and 3.8M in Montreal, and they *still might not be able to make the business case for a high-speed rail there* for a line that would cost the same as our fantasy Nova Scotia rail line.&gt;That's what I keep saying. Negative population growth in Nova Scotia the past few years and yet the city keeps issuing permits and allowing development of more and more buildings.

While I agree that the city is overbuilt, the population of Halifax [has been growing at a steady rate] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm).

&gt;When most of council gets their campaign money from developers it's really not hard to understand. Just follow the money. 

There's no need for unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. They only undermine whatever argument you were trying to make.

Developers are building because borrowing conditions are dirt-cheap. They build a structure, sell it, then build something else. Once interest rates go up this building boom will come to a quick end, and the purchasers of these buildings - already experiencing vacancy in new buildings - might find themselves squeezed. That's why you see intelligent landlords like Killam not being anywhere near as aggressive in their developments / acquisitions as smaller property owners have been recently. Read the CMHC report [for yourself] (http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/odpub/esub/64267/64267_2015_B01.pdf):

- "Multiple starts are expected to record starts levels above the ten-year average during the forecast period in both 2015 and 2016. Favourable borrowing conditions continue to support the development of rental unit projects while vacancy rates are on the uptick in newer structures."

It's not the city's job to tell developers their investment decisions are risky.Given the Conservative candidate got 9,105 votes vs. 10,319 for the NDP and 10,237 for the Liberals I would call it a fairly competitive contest and not write third place off as a 'non-factor'.Densification is indeed a (generally) laudable goal but the vast majority of new developments are in the suburbs. Even if we did as you say, though, it would likely be decades before we could materially cut property taxes on a municipal level - which would probably only be a big signal to the province to up their portion as happened when the feds cut the GST portion of our HST.Nobody, but nobody is going to tell the public not to buy a house - even if all the economic signals are that it might not be the best time to. By saying 'in the current climate the housing market is not a sound investment in the GTA and GVA' and anywhere else that's overheated the agencies themselves will be the trigger for a correction - something that is a huge political liability when irate homeowners go looking for someone to blame for their suddenly-diminished property values even if the agencies themselves are just speaking the obvious truth.

You don't have to warn me about condos, but in some markets there is literally no other option for ownership at median income levels. Ownership still has an innate appeal and in the right circumstances is the correct course, but there's no denying the risks and some markets are making the case for it impossible to justify for a lot of people.If I report your post will it cause a feedback loop and cause you to self-destruct?

Kidding aside, congrats and I'm sure you'll do great.&gt;Hi! I haven't seen anything like this before, so I made it myself. The good news is that now I have a basic level of proficiency with Inkscape. The bad news is that someone's probably already done this.

I can't help but wonder what it would sound like if you assigned each party a note and played the resultant music...&gt;Catherine McKenna - Environment and Climate Change

Adding 'and Climate Change' to the Minister's title is a big exclamation point on the change from the previous administration and also sets up some pretty hefty expectations for action on that file.Image source and further details available [here] (http://www.darpanmagazine.com/magazine/spotlight/taking-commandlieutenantcolonel-harjit-singh-sajjan/). Information on his just-revealed appointment is available [here] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/harjit-sajjan-mp-vancouver-south-defence-minister-1.3303667). Crossposted from /r/Canada/Image source and further details available [here] (http://www.darpanmagazine.com/magazine/spotlight/taking-commandlieutenantcolonel-harjit-singh-sajjan/). Information on his just-revealed appointment is available [here] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/harjit-sajjan-mp-vancouver-south-defence-minister-1.3303667). Crossposted from /r/Canada/We have a Minister of Environment *and Climate Change*. Quite a remarkable difference in tone from yesterday when our action on fighting climate change amounted to mostly hoping it would go away.Harper's parameters weren't the problem - cutting to 30% below 2005 levels in the next 15 years is a respectable (though not optimal) starting point for real action. The problem with Harper's approach is that no one in the country (or the rest of the planet) really expected him to act on those targets, as evidenced by wholesale inaction for the past 10 years. Dropping the goal year from 2030 to 2025 ignores just how little has been done in the past 10 years.

Realistically as well, exactly how much of a plan do you think could be thrown together in a few weeks? It's either go with this, go with something haphazard that no one will take seriously, or go with no promises at all.

Trudeau will be judged on what he does in the next 4 years. This is literally the first day of his government. Cynicism is fun, but let's wait until more data is in.&gt;He's had 4 years in Opposition to come up with an emissions target - he refused to do so.

Did you see what happened to Stephan Dion in 2008 when he pushed a sensible environmental strategy? He was absolutely savaged for it. Returning to the same strategy would have been electoral suicide for any party - partly why even the NDP barely touched the file.

&gt;Given that the Chretien/Martin years were as equally horrible on climate change as the Harper years, what possible reason should we have to be optimistic about this government

You may want to revisit your knowledge of history, at least about the Martin government. During Martin's administration, Minister of the Environment Stephan Dion secured $10 billion in funding for full implementation of Kyoto under what was known as [Project Green] (http://blogs.canoe.com/davidakin/main-page/kyoto-and-canadas-green-plan/). The Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc brough the government down before much of it could be implemented, though.

&gt;what possible reason should we have to be optimistic about this government

You don't have to be 'optimistic', just temper your cynicism a little. It's a destructive force. Constructive action would be to contact your MP (whoever they may be) and the PMO and ensure they are aware of your desire for a robust climate policy. You think these policies (which haven't really been announced yet) aren't aggressive enough? Let the government know.

&gt;EDIT: And if you think 2005 baseline levels or a 2030 target date are appropriate, then you really aren't terribly serious about climate change either, so no wonder you're wowed by Trudeau.

Perhaps do a little research before slinging inappropriate downvotes and insults. Just a suggestion.&gt;You think Dion was savaged for his "Green Shift" plan, rather than being maybe the worst communicator ever to lead a major political party in Canada? Please.

Not being the most effective communicator didn't help (courtesy of Steve Murphy's [unethical character-assassinating interview] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/ctv-broke-ethics-code-in-dion-interview-standards-council-1.811860)) but pretending Dion wasn't savaged for the Green Shift is historical revisionism. The risks of the plan were [well known] (http://www.thestar.com/news/politics/federalelection/2008/10/17/dion_ignored_green_shift_warnings.html) but Dion went ahead with it anyway, and the attack ads were completely focused on those, not 'poor communication skills'. [[1] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dion-s-green-shift-threatens-national-unity-harper-1.739593)] [[2] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tory-attack-may-stretch-truth-but-works/article25581763/)] [[3] (http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=4048)]

&gt;Wait - the Liberal were in power from 1993 until 2006, right? Isn't that part of history?

Chretien's inaction on climate change is indefensible. Pretending it was being ignored under Martin, though, is another heaping helping of historical revisionism.

&gt;Thank you for exposing yourself as a Liberal hack who is more interested in political points than sound policy.

I've backed everything I've said with ample citations. They're all grounded in the historical record. If I'm a 'Liberal hack' I'm doing a less than stellar job by severely criticizing Chretien and by saying there's no ground whatsoever to praise Trudeau yet.

Conversely, there's no ground to be such a cynic - it is literally the first day of government and the Paris climate conference has not yet happened.

What message are you trying to spin with historical revisionism, personal attacks, and cynicism based off of events that haven't even transpired yet? That sort of tactic failed spectacularly for one Stephen Harper - I'd hoped to see the end of it for a time with the end of his term in office.Nope. Tone doesn't, by itself, mean anything. I'm hopeful that it signals this government will take the file more seriously but I'm not going to give them any credit for anything other than concrete action.Yeah. So far this government has been *saying* some encouraging things but saying is a hell of a lot easier than doing. I try not to be a cynic until it is warranted - I guess that sometimes comes off as naive or overly optimistic.Yeah, because the NDP proved themselves such a super-trustworthy partner just a few years prior. For it was Layton himself who delivered us into the tender mercies of Stephen Harper to gain 11 seats, [sinking deals he helped create] (http://torontolife.com/city/stephen-marche-jack-layton-legacy/) like Kelowna and national day care and giving up the only real influence the NDP ever had on national governance.

The NDP are not saints, they are just as opportunistic and political as any other party.You could say the details of the precise location are a little... cloudy.

^^/I'llseemyselfout...&gt;Yes, because the NDP was honour-bound to have to always support the Liberals, no matter how corrupt they were

Puh-leeze. That's a strawman so overstuffed he's about to explode.

The NDP held real power. Layton got a lot of what he said he claimed was important to him. They gave that up for optics. The historical record is there in black and white should you ever decide to take off your orange-coloured glasses.&gt;Noticing how quick you are defending 2008...

Didn't say a word about it, at least as far as 'coalition talk' is concerned. Just that the NDP are unreliable and opportunistic, same as any political party.Holy hell, that could have gone massively wrong. I can't imagine what this kid was thinking.I'm gratified it took this long for these sorts of alarmist claims to appear. I was worried they'd show up sooner.

Fortunately Canada is now accepting the actual science behind the climate change rather than fringe Conservative talk radio conspiracy theories about fictitious 'wealth redistribution' fantasies, with Canada wisely going so far as to appointing a [climatologist and former IPCC member as Minister of Science] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsty_Duncan).

Canada has rejected unscientific fearmongering. Your post will not overturn this accomplishment.

Step out of the myopic world of the anti-science echo chamber of so-called 'climate skeptics' and educate yourself. Or don't. One delusional American is of no importance to our country.There are minor, selective ways in which marijuana is somewhat worse than tobacco. Marijuana can lead to sufficient impairment to make operating a motor vehicle dangerous, for example. In other ways, though, marijuana isn't as dangerous as tobacco.

(Using the past tense feels good).I think it was part of Canada's Action Plan to grow oranges in Nunavut in a couple of decades.Thanks for your concern, chum, but I think we'll be fine. Focus on 'saving' your own country if you would be so kind.The details on the new government's position on TPP are not yet clear. The Japanese Prime Minister has said both he and Trudeau are 'defenders' of it but Trudeau himself has yet to state a position.

Reportedly Canada has signed at least 15 'side letters' to modify TPP, with the potential for more to come. If we can somehow escape the mess of modifications to our copyright and patent laws and affirm the supremacy of our own health and environmental laws TPP will be a bit easier to swallow. Right now it's all speculation, though.Keep in mind that the content of the many [side letters Canada has signed] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/several-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-pact-federal-officials-say/article26763531/) to modify TPP for Canada have yet to be revealed. Future side letters can also be negotiated without having to reopen TPP.Keep in mind that the content of the many [side letters Canada has signed] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/several-side-deals-to-accompany-final-tpp-pact-federal-officials-say/article26763531/) to modify TPP for Canada have yet to be revealed. Future side letters can also be negotiated without having to reopen TPP.Somebody seems to have swapped the first line items in the 'do' and 'don't' sidebar...Well, it wouldn't be at will. The party (or parties) to these side letters would have to agree to let Canada modify the deal. Doubtless they'd want something for any changes we'd want to make.They can contain whatever the parties agree on. They can modify any clause of the agreement, or multiple ones at the same time, major or minor. We'll know more once they're revealed.&gt;How can we inform our government on the parts of the TPP that concern us in hopes they'll draft a side letter?

I would suggest contacting your MP and our new Minister of Trade Chrystia Freeland - though it might be a few days before they all get set up with appropriate contact information.I'm not telling you how to react, just that there is information yet to be released.Note this bit at the end of the article on TPP side letters just released by the [Toronto Star] (http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/11/05/tpp-side-letters-cover-everything-from-borders-to-bc-lumber.html): "Canada also signed other letters with various TPP countries covering intellectual property and government procurement."

There are in fact [8 such side letters] (http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/tpp-ptp/instruments.aspx?lang=eng) involving intellectual property. None seem to address the 70 year term, however.Altering what the agreement says is exactly what these side letters do, such as the primacy of Canada's BC lumber controls cited in the article. [Read them for yourself] (http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/tpp-ptp/instruments.aspx?lang=eng).If I had a best-selling book I wouldn't much care what happens to the copyright after I'm dead - and most likely my kids would be too given the average age of a published author is [37 years old] (http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/06/24/why-new-novelists-are-kinda-old/). This doesn't benefit content creators one bit.Indeed they are. I get that publishing houses / studios / etc. take some element of risk in publishing a work but 50 years after the creator expires is plenty of time to earn a return on that investment, and there's nothing stopping Disney from making Mickey Mouse content after the copyright on him expires. Their protests ring hollow to me.An interview with Peter Mansbridge on the day of the cabinet unveiling isn't what I'd call a puff piece.Yep, so if I had kids at 25, wrote the book at 37, and died at 83 my kids would be 103 by the time the copyright expires under our current regime or 123 under TPP's proposed changes.Why? What benefit do you derive?Take part. Tell her that if that's what you believe. There's no guarantees she'll listen if you speak, but staying silent assures an absolute certainty of not being heard.Best one of these yet. The underlying music consistent throughout was a nice touch.I'm curious as to what specific increase in benefit you derive from your work being protected 70 years after your death vs. 50 years after your death.It isn't so much that he's refused to testify, it's that his public story on the matter keeps changing. Invoking 'privilege' to say he doesn't have to testify is also super, super weird. It seems that those two things combined convinced the Premier that Younger was a liability in terms of trustworthiness.There is [already a mechanism for changing TPP] (http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/tpp-ptp/instruments.aspx?lang=eng).Residents oppose development citing unique character of the neighbourhood / traffic concerns / property values.

At this point journalists might as well have a standard form for these sorts of stories and just change the address each time.I really hope the PC version of Fallout 4 isn't some unoptimized buggy mess - as in, I really hope it's not a typical Bethesda game. I'm through with Metal Gear and itching for something new.I used to do the same, but what I found would happen is I'd buy a bunch of cheap, interesting-looking games and not play any of them. I found when I switched to buying one full-price new game I for some reason felt more obligated to actually play it.

I bought all of the games you listed for full price (save for Fallout 4 of course) and don't regret any of them one bit. All were excellent.So you're saying it'll keep you sane while you're... cooped up?I don't have a definite yes or no answer I can find a citation for. Going by other trade deals, though, I can't imagine there would be no possibility for post-ratification bilateral side deals, especially given Clinton's promise to not ratify the existing deal and her realistic chance of becoming the next president.Good call. Me too. I can wait. Look, this is me waiting. Patient as can be.

I skipped it all for Skyrim and don't feel like I'm missing anything. Same with Witcher 3 - loved the game, probably won't buy any DLC whatsoever.I don't own it, but I've played it on a friend's PS4.

Sorry!You are comparing Sept-Oct job numbers to July-August job numbers. Statistics Canada is the source of both job loss and job gain reports for this time period:

Perception is hard to quantify, but if you make declarative statements like 'blatantly pro-X' instead of a more nuanced statement like 'seemed to favour X' then you're going to have to back it up with something definitive.The onus is always on those advocating change. However, to answer your question, New Zealand calculated the cost of copyright extension famously calculated the lifetime cost to consumers and businesses to be [$55 million NZD] (https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151006/16455732456/new-zealand-confirms-that-tpp-would-extend-copyright-terms-many-countries-block-us-plans-to-reduce-terms.shtml).

Would you care to answer my previous query?Pros:

- Canada is expected to ship [700,000 carloads of oil by rail to the United States this year] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/pipelines-winning-as-crude-slump-hits-oil-by-rail/article24866894/). Building the pipeline would enable this number to be reduced. Transporting oil by rail is more expensive, generally riskier, and generally more environmentally damaging than a well-built and properly-monitored pipeline.
- Because transport by pipeline is cheaper and more reliable, it enables Canadian oil producers to retain more profit.
- Construction of the pipeline would generate significant economic activity.

Cons:

- Pipelines aren't always well-built and well-monitored. Recent pipeline spills can be quite damaging.
- Building a pipeline necessitates a new transportation corridor resulting in environmental disruption, whereas transport by rail uses existing infrastructure.
- That rail capacity doesn't go away just because the pipeline exists. Therefore constructing the pipeline may have the effect of raising overall delivery capacity of Canadian oil provided there are producers willing to pay the higher delivery fees for rail after Keystone XL reaches capacity. If oil prices rebound that means there could be significant new development in Alberta's oil sands that wouldn't necessarily have occurred had delivery capacity been more constrained by the number of available rail cars. This is a more distant hypothetical than the other cons but is a consideration.Never underestimate the ability of Ontarians to overstate things, or assume their provincial matters are the most pressing national issues. Even your own budget watchdog says the [picture is mixed] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/streetwise/ontario-watchdogs-tough-hydro-one-privatization-report-isnt-so-clear-cut/article27073801/):

- "Four crucial tables in the appendix illustrate just how confusing the short conclusion can be. According to the auditor\u2019s own calculations, of the four scenarios he modelled out to 2025, two suggest the initial public offering will ultimately add to the province\u2019s net debt burden \u2013 and two suggest the province\u2019s debt load will be better off because of the deal."

I really hope legal weed helps Ontario mellow out a little. All your drama is annoying the rest of the country. Be, like, rational, man.

*Ontario-centric drama confirmed. You guys are ridiculous.No, it's not, but we generally don't subject the rest of the country to it at maximum volume 7 days a week. I'm no fan of Wynne (or more accurately I have no opinion of her) but if she was seen ordering a Starbucks latte there'd be 5 national editorial boards lambasting her for shunning Tim Hortons within the hour.Naturally. But day-in day-out rehashings of the same Ontario-only story in the national press drowning out truly national matters gets very tiresome. Quebec, BC, and Alberta combined don't produce 10% of the headlines Ontario does - and the vast majority of Ontario headlines aren't new stories.Since very few content creators are capable of receiving this monetary benefit 50-70 years after their own deaths the question is very much not answered.Beats me, but that's not the point. Why should politicians be allowed to interfere with them in any way? What if it weren't guns but, say, an anti-vaxxer President were elected?Kind of a harsh criticism with no real foundation anywhere in the article. Do you have any substantive evidence to back up such a drastic accusation of 'shameless degeneracy'?Given the somewhat over-exuberant atmosphere around this government's early days I imagine they could ask volunteers to (safely) remove and dispose of them and they'd be gone overnight from a fair bit of the country for no cost.Pretty much as described in the Macleans article. Excessive exuberance? Maybe. But 'shameless degeneracy' is a slur too far.Even though the question had absolutely nothing to do with 'reining in public sector wages and/or benefits' or even anything related to public servants at all? How is this in any way reflective of their 'morality' as servants rather than their opinion as individuals on an unrelated political issue?

Sure people shouldn't boo reporters but I'm having a hard time connecting this display by a small portion of the crowd with 'shameless degeneracy' in the public service.The 'optics' of a distasteful response by a few in a crowd to a question unrelated to their roles should not be extrapolated to all public servants. Not every public servant in Canada attended the press conference.

I would suggest treating those whose behaviour your found distasteful as individuals rather than representative of [~257,000 people] (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/psm-fpfm/modernizing-modernisation/stats/ssen-ane-eng.asp).Largely it's not about results, it's about setting a tone as a cooperative partner. First Nations want an inquiry, said inquiry isn't likely to be prohibitively expensive, and so to show that the government is willing to listen to FN Trudeau will go along with it. Enough actions like this, even if the benefit of each separately is marginal, collectively will help repair the relationship between Ottawa and First Nations, which is something that will pay longer-term dividends as education and economic outcomes amongst FN peoples improve by virtue of this kind of cooperation.&gt;On a scale from 8-10 how quickly do you plan to forget that Alberta/Western Canada exists? 

With 29 MPs in Western Canada it's pretty unlikely.

&gt;What is your first big money wasting project for Quebec? Surely you can take some of the wests money for something - your father built mirabel airport, maybe you can use that as some inspiration

Probably by making sovereignty more difficult by upholding the Clarity Act and not being a dick to the provinces for no reason, so Quebec will continue to draw on equalization as they slowly improve their economy. Not cheap in the short term, though!

&gt;Any tips on how BC/Alberta/Sk can quickly separate from the east? We'd like to do it sooner rather than later.

Well, job #1 would be for such movements to purge all the whacko nutjobs and fringe lunatics from their ranks. This unfortunately would have the side effect of having no one left to vote for western separation.

&gt;Your wife just fired the government chef at 24 sussex, I wasn't aware your wife had the abilities to fire government employees. I'm curious:

[Even the Chef says that he was let go by his manager] (http://www.ottawasun.com/2015/11/06/sophie-trudeau-didnt-fire-24-susse-chef-says-team-trudeau).

&gt;Since WHEN does the WIFE of a Prime Minister get to fire government employees?

Hello salty echo.

&gt;Where was it in your vision of hope and change that one of his first orders of business would be firing people? Real change? Right?

Did we forget how to order things numerically?Even so, my main point is that it's quite unfair to claim the whole public service displays such partisanship based on the actions of a few.There are ~257,000 public servants. I reject the notion that you can paint any such a large, diverse group with a uniform partisan brush.Generally one flop per slice, but if I overclock the spring I can get anywhere from two to four.&gt;PC as in politically correct \u2013  given his perfect predictability in espousing the traditional causes of the left, whether they be legalizing marijuana, gender parity, climate change, what have you.

If supporting these causes are the 'old style' Solomon is portraying as a negative then I have to ask exactly what the 'new style' is.&gt;We can't afford adequate snow removal

We'll never have adequate snow removal in the most extreme circumstances unless we have ten times the number of staff and vehicles that are needed for typical snow events.

&gt;a sewage treatment plant that works in a rainstorm

When was the last time this was a problem? 2009?

&gt;or improved transit

'Improved transit' is pretty vague. We have new terminals and are adding buses and drivers [all the time] (http://thechronicleherald.ca/thenovascotian/1281484-on-the-bus-halifax-transit-offers-map-to-the-future). 

I'm not saying a stadium is a swell idea but come on, reign in your negativity a little - or at least do some research first.&gt;I think free trade is a good thing in and of itself. And this deal may not be perfect, but it can only hurt us to be on the outside of a trading zone with our biggest trading partners.

We aren't, though. We [already have free trade agreements] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada#/media/File:Canada_FTAs.png) with [all of the major players in the TPP] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership#/media/File:TPP_enlargement.png) with the exception of Japan, and we were in the middle of negotiating such an agreement when TPP interrupted the process. The rest, [Australia included] (https://www.asiapacific.ca/statistics/trade/bilateral-trade-asia-product/canadas-merchandise-trade-australia), are minor trading partners we could negotiate bilaterally with as the need arises.&gt;Snow clearing is a problem in my neighbourhood even under normal winter conditions. 

Even if that's the case your neighbourhood =/= the entire city. 

&gt;The beach at the Dingle was closed over the summer because of bacteria introduced into the water when the local treatment facility was overwhelmed by rainwater. If you're interested in the subject and willing to do "some research first" you could do a little googling and find other recent examples. 

I'm aware. Excess bacteria levels doesn't mean the sewage plant 'isn't working', though. It's a common thing in other jurisdictions too. [[1] (http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/06/29/storm-yuck-alert-heavy-rain-often-sends-untreated-sewage-into-lake.html)] [[2] (http://www.durham.ca/print.asp?nr=/departments/health/health_protection/beaches/whyBeachesPosted.htm&amp;setFooter=/includes/health/healthfooterBeaches.inc)] [[3] (http://wgntv.com/2015/08/28/high-levels-of-bacteria-from-sewage-in-the-chicago-river/)] [[4] (http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/eh/water_quality/beach_grades.cfm)] and a million more out there.

&gt;Basic improvements in transit would include a card system for paying fares, an app (even the bridge project has an app) and real time tracking of busses. New terminals improve the experience of the passengers who pass through them but little to improve the system as a whole.

You mean like the [Automated Vehicle Location System] (https://twitter.com/hfxtransit/status/590550691824934912) launching next year?If you desire standards of service well in excess of those in comparable regions, fine, but by definition you cannot then accuse the city of delivering sub-par services. There are of course always improvements to be made but hyper-negative cynicism is not productive.&gt;Sounds like you're living in denial.

A couple of dozen people is not a significant threat. More people in Canada have been killed by their fridge falling on them than scary terrorists.

&gt;With Trudeau, all of those convicts will be out of the street again soon enough.

Trudeau ain't a judge. First degree murder [already carries a mandatory life sentence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_Canada) and that's not likely to change. We don't need to pass new laws - existing ones work fine to deal with whatever terrorists come up with.The proposed amendments that the Liberals put forth are available on their website [here] (https://www.liberal.ca/wayne-easter-on-our-amendments-to-c-51/). If you don't want any politician's spin on it the full text of those amendments is available [here] (https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/03/C-51.pdf).Said amendments were proposed and put forth in detail in the platform and [on their site] (https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/03/C-51.pdf). Judge for yourself.Vice posts some very good, insightful articles from time to time. This is not one of them. One civic motion and one business lawsuit does not equate to 'losing our shit'.Not to be cantankerous but my advocacy would be against building one. It's one thing to admire past leaders for their accomplishments or personal qualities but something on the scale of Mount Rushmore passes from admiration to veneration. I don't think that's consistent with the modern Canadian psyche.

Nor, I might add, is ruining the ecosystem of a whole mountain for a monument. 90-100 years ago that sort of thing might have been acceptable but it'd never fly today.They would have to survive to make a material impact. Income splitting will not (aside from seniors) and TPP is somewhat still up in the air - on top of that Harper's contribution was pretty marginal given how many states were involved in its negotiation.

As for TFSAs, sure, they're swell, but they're no more impactful than RRSPs, and I don't have the slightest clue off the top of my head who was in charge when those came into effect.

If those are the top contributions of the Harper era I don't see a case for him being on this hypothetical monument.&gt;We got completely fleeced. These must have been the most expensive votes ever bought in Nova Scotia. While Maine is collecting their 1.6 million, we didn't think to make a repayment clause for our 10s of millions? 

We'd only have a case if some part of the contract were violated. No matter how incompetent government may seem I guarantee you that they've had a lot of lawyers look over the agreement to look for any such thing. A lawsuit against Nova Star would be a great bit of optics to let the government shift most of the blame to the company so they'd be chomping at the bit to launch one if they could find any reason to.High-profile stuff that was in their platform anyway. These are basically just re-announcements of their campaign promises, but it is a positive to see them rededicating themselves to their promises in such a public way when winning a majority didn't necessarily obligate them to do so.Well, if every nation were to kick in their share of GHG emissions towards this $100B fund then Canada's minimum share would be [$1.6B] (https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=54C061B5-1), of which we've previously pledged about [$300M] (http://news.gcfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Status-of-Pledges-2015.10.18.pdf) (a third of which is a loan).

Since this fund is meant to help developing nations, though, they would be excluded from contributing and therefore Canada's minimum contribution would be higher.I have no problem with a right-wing leaning news source. I'd happily listen to a rational opinion that is from a different viewpoint than my own. I freely admit that sometimes the conservative approach is more sensible than the progressive approach in some situations.

Ezra, though, just spins [naked partisan Falsehoods] (http://www.albertaoilmagazine.com/2015/11/better-than-ezra/) for views. Amongst soft centrists like me (who are actually open to listening to all sides) he does more damage to the right-wing than he does to his intended targets.I learned the hard way to make frequent manual backups of my save directories in these sorts of games.You're just mad because your pack didn't come with a rookie card for Garneau.

Joking aside, yeah, this is a bit excessive. I take some comfort in that at least it's not the government themselves doing it, and that once this honeymoon is over journalists will return to hitting the ministers with difficult questions... I hope.As long as some effort is made to make the dollar value of the toys be at least somewhat close to the value of the parking ticket, otherwise I guarantee at least half of them will be 50 cent dog toys from Dollarama.&gt;He says that like it was an indisputable fact. It could well be False. The average family healthcare cost from taxes is $11,375. Every hundred refugees that come here and use our healthcare system is costing us a million dollars worth without giving into the system. 

Your data is off, inflating your conclusion. Refugee health care costs were on average [one tenth those of average Canadians] (http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/06/15/standing_up_for_refugee_health_in_canada.html) [[2] (http://ccrweb.ca/sites/ccrweb.ca/files/ifhreporten.pdf)] even before the cuts to refugee health care.Yeah, I suppose I am raining on the parade a little, but I felt it was a point I had to make. Nothing wrong with the hypothetical discussion, though.Actions determine whether or not the individual was a wise choice for the role or not but it's impossible to deny that their identity has an impact as well. For evidence of that simply look at the reaction of First Nations peoples, Sikhs and historically underrepresented groups in general to the makeup of our new cabinet. Many more feel involved, engaged, and better represented than in previous administrations - and hopeful for future representation even if the number of cabinet ministers of their specific background varies in the future. That counts for something.Boy there sure are a lot of articles about 'what Trudeau needs to do soon'. Have there ever been so many demands on an administration for immediate action less than a week into its tenure?&gt;There aren't very many East Asians or Black People in cabinet. 

That doesn't much matter. It's the inclusiveness of appointing a significant number of cabinet ministers who do not fit the stereotype of 'white male' that has people talking.

&gt;I think it's a large part to do with new government bliss. 

That would not explain why these choices are attracting international attention from people who couldn't even tell you who Stephen Harper was and largely couldn't identify Trudeau either.&gt;Trudeau appointed only 3 more women than Harper did.

Well, to be fair, Trudeau's first cabinet is also [8 members smaller] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/compilations/federalgovernment/MinistrySize.aspx) than Harper's final cabinet.

&gt;The point I'm making is that all of Canada's parties are inclusive and diverse. 

I didn't mean to imply they aren't, just that diversity in and of itself is not an empty gesture.Man, you can't go all violent when somebody comes to a conclusion you don't like. Educate yourself on the science and question the methodology if you find any flaws, but death threats? And now he has the nerve to say [*he's* the victim] (http://beforeitsnews.com/environment/2015/11/dana-durnford-tells-arrest-story-on-richie-allen-show-2540964.html) and this is an attack on 'freedom of speech'? I have no sympathy for this man.I would suggest that the dynamic at the federal level is different enough that provincial experience is not particularly relevant.I have nothing productive to add, so I'll just state that I love SU&amp;SD. Very entertaining interview, slightly awkward and disorganized, which only added to its charm.Well, here is the news release announcing the switch:

- [SUBWAY\u00ae Canada welcomes PepsiCo Canada as exclusive national beverage and snack provider] (http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/subway-canada-welcomes-pepsico-canada-as-exclusive-national-beverage-and-snack-provider-540058291.html):
 - "One key element of the new partnership will give customers even more customization options when they visit their local restaurant with the installation of Pepsi Spire "
 - "Conversion to the new PepsiCo brand choices is currently underway at SUBWAY\u00ae Canada restaurants and will be completed in all 3,200 Canadian outlets by spring 2016."Construction on that also started in 1948 and is not without controversy. It's also in the United States where grandiose monuments are more apropos.Write [the Minister] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Chrystia-Freeland%2884665%29) too. Hold Freeland to her promise of 'meaningful consultations'.There are no nations in Europe that welcome Roma.  There are already hundreds of thousands of them in every major nation in the EU. [Source] (http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/europe-failing-to-protect-roma-from-discrimination-and-poverty-a-942057.html)My semi-bold prediction: These 'consultations' will last past the US presidential election. Trudeau will silently hope for a Democratic victory and Clinton (or Sanders, though this is looking less likely) killing TPP so he doesn't have to deal with it and look weak to either free trade backers or anti-TPP citizens. Worked for him on Keystone, after all.&gt;What is an SJW?A lazy derogatory label you can use to apply to people whose causes you don't like so you can attack an easy strawman instead of actually addressing them as individuals?Maybe not, but both Democratic front-runners in the US are. With the Republicans descending into farce it's looking more and more likely that the US will pull out of TPP, giving Trudeau a cheap and easy way of getting out of a controversial problem. It worked for Keystone after all.I have to wonder what prompted Mulcair to go from ["enthusiastically in favour of TPP"] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-tom-mulcair-says-stephen-harper-is-weak-and-vulnerable-on-tpp-talks-1.3178689) to [opposed] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ndp-government-would-not-adhere-to-a-tpp-deal-mulcair-says-in-letter/article26631467/). The change in stance came before the deal was released so it couldn't have been prompted by the full content of the deal. Without knowing exactly why it sort of undermines the credibility of his opposition a little.&gt;Hilary may be saying that, but there's plenty of time for her to "reconsider" once the primary and/or election is/are secured.

That's definitely possible, but it wouldn't surprise me to see these 'consultations' Trudeau is promising drag on until the US picture becomes clear. If the US takes care of the problem for him, great (for him). If not, he'll be in for a really difficult decision about which camp to appease.

I'd be just as content if either Clinton or Trudeau killed it, personally, for whatever reason they come up with to do so. I'm not anti-free trade but there's just too much other toxic stuff in there for me to support.Rode the Liberal wave over Atlantic Canada primarily because the Liberal incumbent did a fairly good job for the riding and neither the NDP nor Conservative candidate impressed me much. I disfavoured the Conservative platform and was largely ambivalent between the federal NDP and Liberal platforms so it all came down to the local candidate for me.&gt; That's a very savvy take on Trudeau, I hadn't considered that. I'm still skeptical it won't make it through in the US, though - there's too much at stake for the rich and powerful for it to fail.

It's a safe gamble for Trudeau to make, though. There's some chance (maybe low, for the reasons you point out, but at least not zero) of it being resolved for him, but at the absolute worst he winds up right back where he was at the beginning: having to make the decision himself.If such is the price of a healthy, free, and fair democracy that attracts high-caliber talent, so be it. It's not like this is the first election where such reimbursements have occurred. Halifax West. Joanne Hussey didn't overly impress me for the NDP and Michael McInnis just put out Conservative talking points for the most part. Geoff Reagan has done a decent enough job here to earn my vote. We'll see if I chose wisely, I guess, but his margin of victory was significant enough to assuage my concerns.If you swear to be faithful to Queen and country and then join a republican movement to disassociate Canada with the Crown should citizenship be revoked with the same reasoning?And how do you prove that at the time they took the oath they had 'treasonous' thoughts? You can't, after all, backdate future 'treasonous' actions to the time of the oath to invalidate it. You have to prove they were of a 'treasonous' mindset at the time they took it in order to make a legitimate case for fraud.I'm not saying that Hillary or Bernie would 100% not support TPP, just that it's a possibility (moreso for the latter than the former) that Trudeau might want to delay his decision on TPP until there's clarity on. Worst-case scenario is that he still has to make the decision on his own.Shortly after, maybe. What about a year after? What about 20 years after?

We have adequate laws to deal with 'treasonous' actions without needing to invent bonus punishment for citizens based on the peculiars of how they acquired citizenship.Dead? Nonsense. Those troopers are so skilled at animal handling - not to mention compassionate - that they tamed the supposedly untameable Rancor who is dutifully watching over them as they get some much-needed rest.

The doubt you have in our troops has been noted in your record.&gt;It isn't "bonus punishment". It's recognition of the fact that people who aren't born here need to earn the right to live here, and that right is earned by actually adhering to those 43 words, not just by saying them.

Do they? At what point do they cross the threshold from 'needing to earn it' to 'having earned it'? If not upon receipt of their citizenship then when? Why are people born in Canada considered as not having to 'earn' their citizenship to the same degree?

&gt;At the same time, it isn't black and white. We shouldn't just kick out people at any point. A one year limit is way too short, and a twenty year limit is way too long. It should be something reasonable in between, and five years is about right to me - long enough to enforce the oath without giving people the boot who've established and maintained their current citizenship and effectively abandoned their old one.

Forgive me, but I don't see any rationale behind those time frames other than that they seem to 'feel' right.Well, there goes any notion of changing our energy mix to be more environmentally friendly, especially if prices go up beyond NSP's projections and Muskrat Falls keeps getting delayed.

I'm no fan of ever-increasing rates but this seems like a move for optics more than substance. We'll see, I guess."Prime Minister Trudeau today announced the new panel providing advice on cities will be called the:

C^ommission O^n N^ew S^ustainability : S^uburban - U^rban C^anadian K^inship"
There's no shortage of places to see the Queen's visage in Canada. She doesn't need to be absolutely everywhere, especially when the tradition was something else until recently and there was no rational reason behind the changeover to a royal portrait.At the start of the campaign it seemed like Mulcair was a positive factor pushing me towards potentially voting NDP. I won't say he ever went fully to a negative factor for me but he sure at least fell to 'neutral' in my eyes.

When he switched from being an 'enthusiastic supporter of TPP' to opposing it without having read the text I remember feeling somewhat sorry for him. I personally think I oppose it but to do so before it was made available smacked of desperate opportunism of the sort that sank the last Liberal-NDP informal coalition in 2005. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'm happy with a Liberal majority but I never expected the NDP to be a consistently reliable partner in any minority situation given their history.I doubt it solely because of the cost involved. There's better ways to spend [$1M+] (http://www.torontosun.com/2013/06/29/royal-rebranding-cost-taxpayers-more-than-1m) than a PR exercise.Relevant text from the article:

- "In 1469, in an effort to subdue tensions between Scotland and Denmark, King James III was betrothed to Margaret of Denmark, daughter of Christian I, King of recently unified Denmark and Norway. A handsome dowry was arranged, but as Christian was short of financial clout, first Orkney and subsequently Shetland were offered as protection in lieu of payment."

- "When it became clear that the dowry money was not forthcoming, the fate of the islands became inevitable. In 1470 the long-established title Norse Earl of Orkney was officially ceded to James III, and on 20 February 1472, both Orkney and Shetland became official protectorates of the Scottish crown."A second vehicle tried to flee the scene and was apprehended partway down Dunbrack. ~~Crappy tree-obscured picture of it [here] (http://i.imgur.com/dlQiq1s.png)~~.

Two older people got out of the car in the first picture without assistance and were taken off by ambulance. Cops interviewed everyone in the area.&gt;The government has a majority, so they're gonna act as they wish. Not much else someone can do to stop the government's flagship election promise

Considering the mandate Ontarians gave them to do just that it shouldn't be surprising that they're going to implement it. It's not like this wasn't spelled out explicitly in their platform. For better or worse that platform has been endorsed by voters, and the shortfall in CPP relative to average need is well-known. 

Ontarians went with the philosophy of increased state involvement versus more resources for private plans, as they seem to have at the federal level as well. Is that a wise course of action? The CPPIB has a proven track record and the Caisse, while sometimes dallying in political distractions, generally performs well too. Canadians certainly aren't, on average, saving enough for retirement. The personal choice / private plan approach advocated by the Conservatives [hasn't closed that gap] (http://newsroom.bmo.com/press-releases/bmo-rrsp-study-eighty-nine-per-cent-of-canadians--tsx-bmo-201401300924693001).The lamppost was torn out of the ground from the grass right next to the yellow guide wire protectors. Car in the picture was turning and the guy who fled seems to have hit them and took out the light. Everyone looked fine to my (admittedly untrained) eye. Thankfully no one was at that crosswalk waiting to cross.&gt; Is there a reason we are taking 25,000?

That's the number the Liberals ran on and Canadians elected them in a majority government. As for why the Liberals chose that number, advocacy groups have been asking for 10,000 to 100,000 more, so 25,000 must have seemed like a good compromise number.

What the US, UK, and France are doing isn't necessarily relevant to our decisions.About 15 minutes before I posted the pictures. 
&gt;To be fair, the details came out before he hanged his position.  Moreover,  his "enthusiastic support" was always conditional and he made that very clear. 

Unconfirmed, partial details - not really anything to base such a substantial decision on. Harper could stake a firm position since he knew the full details. Trudeau risked looking wishy-washy by taking a wait-and-see approach but without verified, full details (plus all the side letters) it was the only rational option a then-opposition party could take.


&gt;Funny how Trudeau's massive flip-flop of support balanced budgets in July and then advacatinga deficit in August didn't get much attention.

It got plenty of attention at the time. Canadians just thought his old position was wrong, his new one was right, and none of the Conservative or NDP attacks on the 'flip-flop' stuck. People liked the idea of deficit-funded infrastructure spending too much to care.

It's also not strictly comparable since far more information on the state of the economy was available (and verifiable) than details of TPP.Relative to the typical excitement level of Halifax that's the equivalent of a 20 minute Hollywood car chase.

Seriously, though, I believe not remaining more-or-less where the accident happened is an offence.
&gt;An interesting issue that highlights institutional hypocrisy within an oath giving. Doesn't mean they broke a law. Joining a peaceful protest movement is not anywhere close to joining a violent extremist group, and I'm disappointed in you for promoting that connection. That's what the conservatives tried to do with C-51 and its vague language. This type of fear mongering is unacceptable. 

Nonsense. I'm not 'promoting a connection' or 'fearmongering', I'm asking an academic hypothetical. I hardly believe that joining such a group is grounds for any action by the state, just as I disagree with the citizenship-stripping power of C24.



&gt;But the law is clear on your right to free speech. It's also something we cherish. 

I would suggest then not casting inaccurate aspersions on lines of inquiry without taking the time to understand the intent behind them.It's a pretty useless headline, though, so far from the next election and still pretty deep into Trudeau's honeymoon period. A lot of people will respond to those dredging up ghosts of 10-year-old Liberal sins with accusations of old-style fearmongering which, to be honest, it sort of is. There's no evidence that front-line trench-level Ontario staffers had anything to do with the sponsorship scandal.They do, but I question how many of those would involve wrongdoing by staff rather than just improper decisions. The gas plant cancellation, for instance, in and of itself wasn't illegal or unethical, it was just a bad political decision. Although efforts to delete/hide records was unethical that didn't seem to involve any / many staff.

Being 'involved' in a file that wound up as a 'scandal' doesn't necessarily mean any particular staffer has done anything unethical nor that they've displayed poor judgement.Sure, but like I said, the number involved in that process seems to be [extremely small] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/opp-say-mcguintys-chief-of-staff-double-deleted-gas-plant-e-mails/article22851460/).Putting a hold on this was a blatantly political move by the previous administration that may or may not have violated (admittedly somewhat nebulous) caretaker rules as it was clearly the only alternative available to Montreal. Good on our new minister for actually listening to the science on why this is necessary and making what was not the most optics-friendly decision.&gt; I don't believe that Canadians support the alienation of minority groups (like the victims and their families)

A significant majority of Canadians (77%, 51% 'strongly') oppose this monument. This rises to 83% opposed (63% 'strongly') in the National Capital Region. This is not 'rooted in petty partisanship' - most self-identified Conservatives (63% nationally) oppose it too, along with an overwhelming majority of Liberal, NDP, Green, and Bloc supporters.

Even so it's worth looking at the details of the sale to ensure we didn't just give away something valuable to Saudi Arabia in exchange for less than fair market value. It's not like they're willing or even able to undo the sale.

Of course the current government hopes to derive a side benefit by embarrassing the previous administration but transparency is still a worthwhile exercise. There used to be a party leader from Calgary Heritage who espoused those ideals, after all.Voluntary punching bag here.

You want to own a gun? I don't care. Concealed carry? No thanks. There's two nations in the world where concealed carry is common: The United States (in some states) and South Africa. Neither one exactly has a great handle on gun violence.

Is concealed carry (or open carry for that matter) 100% the cause? Not likely, but until there's something like a consensus over what exactly *is* the cause then even at the risk of Shamu bukkake I'm not super keen to make our laws more like theirs.

/Laurentian elite mode off&gt; Selling a monopoly for the purpose of a de-regulated market can work out in government's favour.

For sure, and I'm not saying it hasn't. I just want to know if we got good value for money selling the CWB to Global Grain Group.&gt; I wonder what we'll do about those F-18s? F-35s? You those to expensive jets.

That'll be up to our new Minister of Public Services and Procurement, [Judy Foote] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/judy-foote-ready-to-work-with-fellow-n-l-mps-as-new-cabinet-minister-1.3305387).The article I linked to, though, specifically details that she will be handling the F-35 file.&gt;There's a practical median between "ban all the guns" and "my home is my castle, and I need to carry this Ruger to feel like a man."

What subreddit am I on and how did I find someone making such a sensible point? Oh god what have I become.Canadians as individuals or the Canadian government?

If it's the government then it's useful to avoid the fire-and-brimstone bully pulpit approach in condemning any usurpation of democracy. A lot has been made of Canada's return to 'honest broker' status but the fact is that unsavoury regimes sometimes want to pull back from their extremes (as we may be seeing in Myanmar / Burma) - without risking their own lives in some sort of revolution - and so it's useful to have a country like Canada that can be trusted to assist diplomatically and not be seen to overtly condemn one side, even if their values are inconsistent with our own.

Thus I believe the Canadian government should be somewhat muted in its condemnation of undemocratic actions in other countries and instead offer assistance to smooth over disagreements with the goal of returning to democracy. Will it work in every, or even most, cases? No, but if it works even once it would be a lot better than a vitriolic condemnation that would be readily ignored.&gt;Other than that, probably nothing. Stuff takes time. 

Indeed it does. I don't think there's been such a heavy amount of expectation on any government in modern Canadian history to act on so many things right away. I think we were spoiled by the last couple weeks of the campaign when major new promises were coming at us all the time, while the actual pace of governing and implementing 'change' is necessarily slower.The 'income-driven' philosophy sure hasn't put a dent in the growth of carbon emissions over the past 50 years. The free market is a great tool for many things but environmental stewardship sure hasn't been one of them. Some level of government intervention is required.

Canadians had their chance to keep carbon emissions down without a tax. Time's up.Maybe you should read the [Official Residences Act] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-4/page-2.html#h-3). This is a complete non-story that wouldn't generate a single headline in any other western democracy. The pay range was no different [under Harper] (http://o.canada.com/uncategorized/whats-it-pay-to-be-stephen-harpers-chef-or-housekeeper) either.

Mulcair was entitled to the same when he was opposition leader, and whoever the Conservatives wind up choosing as leader will too. It's perfectly legal, germane, and appropriate in order to allow our leaders / opposition leaders to better focus on their work.&gt;But I'll admit that I'm curious if I'd think the same if it were Harper.

The pay range seems [about the same] (http://www.obj.ca/Blog-Article/b/22467/Harpers-Chef-Gets-a-New-Salary). Harper had a chef and at least two 'servants' who earned the same pay range as these two new nannies. Harper also employed maids, chauffeurs, and gardeners. Even at the height of Harper's unpopularity nobody made much of a story about residence staff.

The exception would be in 2006, when his chef sued for wrongful dismissal, alleging he was 'never paid him for additional duties that included babysitting, washing the family car and burying one of Harper\u2019s pet cats.' The suit was settled out of court, per the article above.&gt; The guy is the prime minister and that's why he gets paid $327,400. I don't think he should incur extra expenses due to restrictions attached to his position -- e.g., I think the "reimburse the cost of private airfare" rule for personal travel which is on government jets for security reasons makes sense, and I don't think he should pay rent for the nannies who are living in the house -- but I do think he should have to pay or reimburse any personal expenses.

Sure, it's fine to have that debate, but it's a little inappropriate to cast blame on Trudeau for following the same rules as his predecessors and leaders of the opposition.&gt; I'm really struggling to imagine any plausible justification for this.

1. [Official Residences Act, Section 7] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-4/page-2.html#h-3).
2. [Precedent] (http://o.canada.com/uncategorized/whats-it-pay-to-be-stephen-harpers-chef-or-housekeeper).&gt; Yes. The Liberal leader is entitled to his entitlements 

As the Conservative leader before him, and as the Conservative leader of the opposition will be.

This has nothing to do with political parties - it's entirely legal. If you want to change the rules, fine, but it's False to pretend this is something novel under Trudeau.&gt;I'm not saying it's against the rules. But I am saying this is against Trudeau's own words. He campaigned on the idea that current entitlements and tax breaks were unfair because they helped families like his.

Where in his campaign did he ever say he was reducing the benefits to public servants / MPs / leaders? Surely you recognize that this staffing expense isn't a 'tax break'.

&gt;He renounced the baby making cheques saying he didn't need them. But once in power I guess it suddenly became fair for the rich and the middle class to pay for his nannies? How is the income splitting and UCCB benefits unfair but paid nannies not?

Because he's the Prime Minister, obligated to be away from his family in service of the people who elected him? The same reason we give additional benefits to diplomats, MPs, and military personnel - we ask sacrifices of them in service of the country, and provide additional support to them over and above the average taxpayer in return.

&gt;He told us again and again that his family, and Harper's family didn't need that "help" and that it was unfair. That narrative apparently no longer applies.

He isn't taking 'help' as a citizen, he's simply taking the same level of employment support as his predecessors for an equally-demanding job.

If he were forced to miss a major international conference or important vote because of family issues there would be a major row by his political opponents over why he's shirking his duties rather than take advantage of his legally-permissible child care. He'd be accused of shunning that for optics at the expense of Canada. His giving up his personal benefit is a meaningless bit of optics, but at least it doesn't have the potential to harm the nation.

This is one of the many no-win situations that his avowed opponents have placed him in.&gt; Obviously he wouldn't have had nannies, but there should be a record somewhere of how much was budgeted for residence care and upkeep. So far the only thing I can find is this

When Ambrose [took the keys to Stornoway] (http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/rona-ambrose-gets-the-key-to-stornoway/) she terminated the existing chef but retained a housekeeper, so Mulcair's staff was at least 2. I'm not sure if he had a chauffeur too, but he was entitled to one. Wikipedia claims a staff of 3, but that's based off of Manning's tenure in 1997.&gt;He placed himself in this situation by saying that people like him didn't need the help. How did he manage to care for his kids during the campaign? Then he didn't need the help because it was "unfair." Trudeau boldly said then that families like his, and the Prime Minister's did not need help.

Specifically, he said the "child care benefit should not go to rich families like his" - [Source] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-says-child-care-benefit-should-not-go-to-rich-families-like-his/article25624594/) Since it isn't, where's the controversy?

&gt;Trudeau alone put himself in the situation by saying that people like the Prime Minister do not need government help.

When did he criticize Harper's staffing of 24 Sussex?&gt;The Official Residences Act has nothing to do with my comment. Maybe read over what I quoted again.

Read it again. 

- 7. (1) The Governor in Council may appoint a steward or housekeeper and **such other employees as the Governor in Council deems necessary** for the management of the Prime Minister\u2019s residence, and may fix their rate of remuneration and conditions of employment.

Childcare personnel are perfectly legal and acceptable.

&gt; No-one is saying the Trudeau's can't pay someone to look after their kids, just that they should. Having staff to maintain Sussex is a little different than having the taxpayer pay for their nannies. 

Why is Trudeau held to a different standard than Harper, Ambrose, or Mulcair?

That this is a 'controversy' at all is absurd.&gt; You speak as if the Trudeau's didn't have nannies before or that taxpayer-funded nannies are the only option.

They're a legally allowable option under the current rules. You want to change the rules? Fine, have that debate, but don't single out one individual for adhering to them.&gt; It seems silly to even talk about polling when parliament hasn't even sat yet.

It is, but polling firms need to keep their names out there, so they'll keep pushing them out from time to time. At least there shouldn't be a deluge of them.The so-called 'Libertarian' political movement does not have sole ownership of the philosophy of civil libertarianism.My point isn't that they used (or are going to use) nannies, just that the option was legally available to them. It's all well and good to have a debate over whether or not this is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds but the same rules apply to Trudeau as to these other leaders.&gt; You're making a strawman. No-one is saying it's against the rules, we're saying it's hypocritical given what he said during the campaign.

Since what he said during the campaign was specifically and solely focused on the [child care tax benefit] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-says-child-care-benefit-should-not-go-to-rich-families-like-his/article25624594/) such accusations of hypocrisy are verifiably False.
&gt; It's the fact Trudeau's position on the UCCB and child care are disingenuous. If he really walked the walk, he wouldn't be having the Canadian taxpayer footing the bill for his children's care.

Why? Because he's changing the system? If he signs a new carbon agreement in Paris will he be required to give up his chauffeur? If he loosens C-51 security measures will he have to give up his security detail?

Applying policy decisions to completely irrelevant personnel matters in the name of avoiding 'hypocrisy' is frankly ridiculous. It makes no practical difference to the country whatsoever who pays for these two individuals, so it's solely an exercise in optics. There are many valid things to criticize this government over and this is just a complete waste of time.

&gt;The other item that isn't even being discussed is why are his kids in Paris at all?

Why should it be discussed? It's not like they're flying commercially or staying in separate hotel rooms. The incremental expense is negligible.That analogy makes no sense at all. Are you seriously equating child care to a crime?Morneau had better explain this discrepancy quickly, and I seriously hope he has a more substantial explanation than the typical 'we disagree with the PBO's forecasts'.&gt; There's a link between Muslims and Muslim terrorists (imagine that), but haven't seen a libertarian gun down a concert hall yet so maybe not so fast on that one...

We did have one self-professed libertarian killing RCMP officers in [Moncton] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/justin-bourque-latest-revelations-about-man-charged-in-moncton-shooting-1.2665900) a year ago, but of course it would be ridiculous to say all libertarians are potential mass murderers.No such claim was made or proven in court. [Bourque plead guilty] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/justin-bourque-sentencing-hearing/article21348506/) and claimed his motive was to 'provoke citizens to rebel against authority'.&gt; If they are living safely in Lebanon they are not refugees when coming to Canada but migrants looking for economic benefits.

'Living' and 'safely' are pretty broad terms. Conditions in refugee camps are [extremely bad] (http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/11/destitute-syrian-refugees-jordan-lebanon-may-return-to-warzone).

We had an election where this was a major issue just over a month ago. This is the democratic will of the Canadian people. You are welcome to voice your objection and rational disagreements but our nation is content to proceed. All 3 major parties are in agreement on this, though they may disagree on the specific details of the program.

&gt;Why are Africans in poor countries not given the same benefit in a relocation and new life? 

Anyone is free to apply to become a refugee in Canada under the same criteria. If accepted, the government will transport them and settle them just as they will these Syrians, although residency details may vary. [Learn more about the process here] (http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/canada.asp).&gt; maybe you should read the quote again, he said Canada cannot afford it and he doesn't need it

If Canada cannot afford $90,000 then we're in pretty dire straits.&gt; That's actually a fair statement. Allegedly, the Finance forecasts were based on the median of private-sector forecasts, with an explicitly-added prudence margin on national GDP.

It certainly is a fair statement but I would hope Morneau would go into more detail as to exactly how his office came to the conclusions it did, and provide a better explanation as to the discrepancy than just a blanket statement of disagreement. I would assume Morneau would have access to the PBO's underlying information.I am directly addressing that by pointing out that he was referring narrowly to the child care tax benefit, as evidenced by the citation I provided earlier. I am pointing out how inappropriate it is to extrapolate that private benefit to citizens onto staffing policy at the Prime Minister's residence.&gt; Is Lebanon offering people no hope of relief ? Are they being killed in Lebanon ? I still feel that by the above definition they are migrants, being brought in to receive financial benefits. 

We are aware of this argument and have chosen to proceed anyway. We have taken in large numbers of refugees in the past from Vietnam and Lebanon, and as a result have thriving communities with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. We see no reason this cannot be repeated with Syrians. [Canada needs immigrants] (http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/26/refugees-economy-canada_n_8658076.html).&gt; in your own wording, "Canada needs immigrants", and taking these people in may better Canada in the long term if they integrate into the areas of the country and society the government wishes them to fall into... 

It hasn't been a problem before. Canada does not have the same degree of ghettoization that we see in many European, and even American, cities. It does happen and needs to be addressed, but the scale is different.

&gt;the use of the term refugees seems to be trying to score brownie points, and to bypass some of the logical discussions around the topic, appealing to people's emotional side instead.

The UNHCR calls them refugees. That's good enough for us.

&gt;Would easing working visa applications, and offering greater perks to professionals relocating to Canada not offer the same benefits at much lower risk? I would suggest that looking to attract people from similar cultures would lead to better integration in the country and provide the same economic stimulus- if these Lebanese-Syrians are not refugees when brought into Canada, there is no reason that the people being brought in to fill Canada's needs be this group in particular.

We don't particularly see a large amount of risk. These are people in obvious need, and urban Syrians are among the best-educated in the region. With adequate screening we believe such concerns can be mitigated.

Immigration to Canada is always welcome. We haven't had a serious problem with 'dissimilar cultures', so we don't really feel a need to restrict immigration in such a manner.

Could we be wrong? Maybe. There are rational reasons to object or be cautious, but it's worked out so far.&gt; Out of curiosity, is there a source you would be able to share, where the UNHCR stated people who are listed as refugees and settle in a country, are still considered refugees when further relocating although they are leaving for reasons other than immediate persecution and conflict, as in this instance?

The UN's [1951 Refugee Convention] (http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c125.html) defines a refugee as someone who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country."

By that definition they continue to be a refugee so long as they are outside the country of their nationality for any of the above reasons. All of the countries in green, light green, or yellow on [this map] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees#/media/File:Refugeeconvention.PNG) agree to that definition by virtue of being members of the convention, but all UN members are bound by it.Well, if great social services were a guarantee of a high birth rate then Scandinavia and Japan would be in the middle of a big baby boom. That they're not suggests it's a little more complex than that.&gt; What business does a private citizen who just happens to be married to the PM have going overseas?

Diplomatic tradition. Find me a country that doesn't do the same.&gt; There's a difference between having a cleaning lady and/or a chef - they're there to serve the house and the functions of state that take place inside. The residence belongs to the state so that makes sense. 

Justin can cook his own meals. A chef most certainly is not needed to maintain the property. Why have a chef, then? To free up the Prime Minister for the duties of the state.

Justin can dust his own bureaus. A cleaning person is not needed to maintain the property. Why have a cleaning person, then? To free up the Prime Minister for the duties of the state.

Justin can watch his own kids. A nanny is not needed to maintain the property. Why have a nanny, then? To free up the Prime Minister for the duties of the state.&gt; Lol, the official rep from Canada has arrived everyone.

Not really. 29% of Canadians say we shouldn't take in any Syrian immigrants at all. That's not a majority, but it's a sizable demographic and their objections should be listened to.

We did just have an election where this was a major issue, though, and we handed one narrative a decisive victory. They have a democratic mandate to implement it.&gt; The upkeep of the house and the experience of being hosted in it fall under the purview of the state. The government picks up the tab for their upkeep.

Where are you deriving this mandate from? The wording of the Official Residences Act is very broad. Where exactly do you get the specific definition of the 'experience of being hosted in it' and why does that include meal preparation but not secondary child care?

&gt;The government should not be paying to raise Justin's kids, in particular when one of the parents are not officially employed. 

What exactly does 'officially employed' mean? 

These two individuals are apparently being employed for ['secondary child care and other duties around the house'] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/spokeswoman-defends-trudeau-familys-use-of-taxpayer-money-for-nannies/article27542948/), implying Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau remains the 'primary' source of child care. 

Exactly what percentage mix of child care duties versus upkeep of the house crosses the threshold of inappropriateness, and why?&gt; What do you think about your country's decision to say it won't discriminate against Muslim refugees, only to double back and discriminate against male Muslim refugees. 

The story is somewhat overblown. Canada is accepting single male refugees. What was said is that because we are accepting the people based on the criteria of who is most vulnerable, it's less likely that some single male refugees will arrive on their own.

To quote the official in charge of the effort, ['single male refugees will be coming'] (http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/single-syrian-men-will-be-coming-top-official-says-1.2675869).

&gt;Ultimately, Canada is accepting a significantly smaller portion than they were initially planning to. Do you feel this was a compromise to satisfy the 29%?

We are still accepting the 25,000 initially promised, just not all of them by the end of 2015. The deadline was stretched into 2016.
&gt;That's tomorrow. Do you think she's with her husband in Paris at the moment? 

A single data point is not indicative of a trend. Michelle Obama has travelled extensively with the President, and indeed has done trips in an official function on her own. 

All this further reinforces the point that spousal travel with world leaders is widespread - not universal, not 100% of the time, but widespread.&gt; No it isn't appropriate, and you've been digging yourself into a hole this entire thread by not acknowledging the basic truth here.

Your interpretation isn't 'the basic truth', it's your interpretation. Stating that what you believe is the 'truth' and anyone who disagrees with you is 'digging themselves into a hole' means your mind cannot be changed and there is no point in engaging in a debate.&gt; My interpretation is based on reason, and the fact this is the sole critique you have of my comment merely reinforces this hypothesis.

I've made my points, and despite your implication they too are based on 'reason'. Until you acknowledge that then there's no point in further discussion.And just because it's not 'obligated as a matter of state' doesn't make it unseemly or unprecedented.

There are many legitimate things to criticize this government for. These small issues are irrelevant to the national picture.I still maintain the ex-pats are better served by having their own MP. Long-term ex-pats have sometimes limited connection to their old riding, and certainly aren't much affected by what goes on there, so they shouldn't influence that riding's choice of representation. A dedicated ex-pat MP (or as many as are necessary) would better represent their interests too.I imagine we would learn from the approach the [French have taken to overseas constituencies] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituencies_for_French_residents_overseas). The Italians do [the same thing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_constituencies_of_the_Parliament_of_Italy).I don't think it would be unconstitutional, though - no one province is gaining any advantage from such an appointment system since such MPs are not representing any province.&gt; So he has no problem rejecting the UCCB because he's too rich but we need to pay the bill for his nannies?

He's the Prime Minister. He has very young children. The need for these nannies is obvious, and since that need is derived from the requirements of his job his employer should rightly cover the expense. To do otherwise is cynical manipulation purely for political optics.&gt;Except the MPs are appointed via regional representation and not at-large. They could get around it by appointing MPs in proportion for the entire country (ie, one for each region). 

Why would the procedure for changing this be any more difficult than passing the [Fair Representation Act] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2011_26/page-1.html)? After all, per [section 44 of the Constitution, 1982] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-56):

- "44. Subject to sections 41 and 42, Parliament may exclusively make laws amending the Constitution of Canada in relation to the executive government of Canada or the Senate and House of Commons."

Both the Fair Elections Act and the [Representation Act, 1985] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-5.6/page-1.html) that it replaced (which also modified the way seats were distributed) were passed by parliament alone.

For that matter, the granting of representation to Nunavut was done as an act of parliament, which also had a dilutive effect on the number of MPs (and Senators) apportioned to the provinces.&gt; They won't stay in Atlantic Canada. 

According to a study by Statistics Canada, Atlantic Canada's refugee retention ratio in 2010 for all refugees arrived from 2000-2006 was [48%] (http://www.cic.gc.ca/English/resources/research/interprov-mobility/section3.asp) - just behind Saskatchewan at 50%. A majority, it seems, did leave, but not all of them.&gt;When asked to rank the top goals of a voting system, the respondents at large said they wanted simple ballots, strong stable governments, the ability to directly elect the MPs who represent their constituency, and assurances that the government has MPs from each region of the country.

Oh, so those who want change would seem to want ranked ballots. After all, STV or MMP would be more complex and less prone to producing 'strong stable governments'.

&gt;Overall, 44 per cent of the respondents picked one of the two systems of proportional representation, while 43 said they were happy with first-past-the-post, and just 14 per cent said they liked the idea of a ranked ballot.

Well, so much for that conclusion. Whatever we wind up doing it seems a large amount of public education needs to be done about exactly what benefits and drawbacks each system has.

Despite all that, this poll seems to support that a referendum - my preferred mode of implementation - would possibly support a change from FPTP, although the margin is pretty tight at 58% for change (PR or ranked) vs 43% who want FPTP.He did say he was quoting a 'party member', and immediately followed that up by an MP with the opposite point of view. It's not fair to attribute either viewpoint to Martin.&gt;As many as 50,000 refugees \u2013 at least 70 per cent from Syria \u2013 could arrive in Canada by the end of next year

...

&gt;Finally, the forecast also encompasses Canada\u2019s refugee intake commitments from other countries, as well as an estimate of how many more Syrian refugees might be sponsored privately by Canadians.

It's a little misleading in the Globe's headline to suggest they're all going to be Syrian. That would be extremely, extremely unlikely.&gt; Some MMP systems (like Best Near-winner) could have a ballot that looks exactly the same as it does now. So this is a spurious statement at best.

Let's take a look at some MMP ballots that are actually in use (and not theoretical models) and see if the criticism of more complex ballots using existing MMP systems is warranted:

- [New Zealand sample ballot - MMP] (http://www.andrewanddave.com/davesblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Ballot-300x196.jpg)
- [German sample ballot - MMP] (http://www.stevendroper.com/German%20ballot.gif)
- [Irish Ballot - STV] (https://independentforum.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irl-ballot-paper.jpg) requiring a ranking 1-7 on this ballot
- And for reference, a [current Canadian sample ballot - FPTP] (http://www.elections.ca/vot/yth/stu/gui/images/dxsmp1-e.jpg)

Doesn't seem like a 'spurious statement at best' when currently-used PR ballots are compared to the current Canadian one.&gt; Looking at those ballots, I still feel that the requirement of a 'simple ballot' is met. It's clear and easy-to-understand.

Let's look at the results of the [Toronto Citizen's Assembly on Electoral Reform] (http://www.citizensassembly.gov.on.ca/en-CA/Get-Involved/Summaries%20of%20Public%20Meetings/Toronto%20Central%20_1.html) when they were presented with the same data:

- "Deciding how to split your vote (on a two-vote ballot) in MMP is complicated."
- "Voting in STV is simpler than in MMP. Preferential voting (in STV) is clear, but deciding how to split your vote (on a two-vote MMP ballot) is tricky."

Those are, of course, only two isolated points as they relate to the ballots themselves. The Assembly listed more positives and some more negatives for each option in the link provided.&gt; I don't have time to read through the report at the moment, but did you catch what market price they were rating it against?

From the article:

- "For instance, Ontarians are paying double for wind power and more than triple for solar power what U.S. consumers pay."
- "In another case in 2013, the government decided to convert a coal-fired plant in Thunder Bay to biomass in order to keep the plant going after the province stopped burning coal for electricity. Energy experts at the OPA told the government the conversion was not cost-effective, but the government told them to do it anyway. As a result, power from the plant costs $1,600/megawatts per hour, which is 25 times more than the cost at other Ontario biomass plants."
- "In a third situation, in January 2010, the OPA warned the province that the Lower Mattagami hydroelectric project was $1-billion over budget, but the government decided to proceed. As a result, power from that plant costs $135/megawatts per hour, compared to an average cost of $46/megawatts per hour for two other recent hydro projects."

Thus 'market rate' would be what similar markets pay or what comparable projects cost.Look, I like MMP as much as the next person, but the ballot is clearly more complicated. Certain demographics will be negatively impacted by that change.

- "A report scheduled for release today by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law shows that poor ballot design and instructions have caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of votes [in the United States]."
- "Studies have shown that those most likely to be confused are elderly, low-income and newly registered voters ... "You tend to find the biggest problem in precincts with large numbers" of those voters, says David Kimball, associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, a co-author of the report."

[Source] (http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-07-20-ballots_N.htm)Tightening the rules under the previous government was a sound decision, and continuing to do so (and building on the work under the Harper administration to set up this down payment hike) also seems prudent.&gt; This is one of the reasons the east has been so willing to accept however many will come. Their population is dwindling and immigrants have kids and start businesses. 

It certainly happened in Halifax after the intake of refugees from Lebanon. Now we have a prominent, successful Lebanese community in the city. There's no reason that experience cannot be repeated with Syrians.&gt; But the rampant downvoting. I just removed a string of my comments because they were downvoted.

The downvoting is ridiculous. My upvote history is full of comments on this sub that I really don't agree with just to try and counteract that trend whenever I see it.

Conversely to downvoting on conservative opinions you'll usually find heavy downvoting on some people supporting refugees here. Some people are just too married to their own interpretation of reality and can't stomach a debate, and that's not unique to any political philosophy.&gt; Do political parties not have access to PBO information unless they form a government? 

I don't think any of them have access to the underlying assumptions behind the PBO reports until they are released. It would interfere with the autonomy of the office if they could sneak a peek early - it would give rise to accusations of meddling, even if there wasn't any.&gt; Too bad Trudeau refuses to open up the reform of the Senate issue.

Given that the courts have repeatedly said that substantial reform isn't possible without amending the constitution - and that's never going to happen - then it's better to have an imperfect fix than none at all. Unless the provinces suddenly indicate they're on board the reform train and are willing to amend the constitution - and not ask for anything else at all as part of that amendment - and further energy expended on this by the federal government is completely wasted.

I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that practically it's not currently possible.Personally I would advocate for overseas MPs, similar to the system used in France or Italy. That way ex-pats aren't influencing the outcomes in ridings they aren't living in and they have representative(s) more attuned to their needs.[Source] (http://www.loc.gov/resource/fsac.1a34823/) - says it's not an approved image host so I rehosted it on imgur.[Source] (http://www.loc.gov/resource/fsac.1a34823/) - says it's not an approved image host so I rehosted it on imgur.&gt; We have this technology we came up a couple decades ago called genetic engineering.

It's a good idea, and one that's [being looked into] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetic-modification-carbon-sequestration/):

- "A new analysis published in the October [2010] issue of Bioscience suggests that by 2050 humans could offset between five and eight gigatons of the carbon emitted annually by growing plants and trees optimized via genetic engineering both for fuel production and carbon sequestration."

Though it looks like someone isn't a fan of the original CBC article judging by the voting on this post.It seems to be a polite rebuttal to world leaders like Obama speaking as if it's already a done deal that Canada will ratify TPP. 

I maintain that the Liberals will be content to let 'consultations' drag on past the US elections just in case the next American government isn't so keen on TPP. If the deal falls apart Trudeau gets to have the problem taken care of without making a single decision. If not then he's no worse off than he is today, stuck having to make the decision himself.Canadian citizens have decided we want a new government that advocates increased levels of spending. If we were honest about it we'd consent that this means government revenue sources - as in, taxes - need to increase to match that spending, that it's not entirely realistic to think we can solely trim or grow our way to these increased spending levels, or that a tick upwards in the tax rate for 'only the wealthy' will do it. Canada being 'back', as Trudeau puts it, brings with it the higher bills of old without the correspondingly elevated tax levels.

It would take a government of great bravery to materially increase taxes, something I don't really expect to see over the short term. I don't know that they'd have done as well in the election had they promised higher taxes instead of deficit spending but a realistic assessment of government revenues versus spending priorities has yet to take place.&gt; We need to stop tooting our horns over 25,000 people. Germany has taken in 700,000, and their population is only 80 million. If Canada did the same we would need to take 260,000 refugees, or about 10X our current effort. 

Interestingly, if the reported [6.3% take-up rate] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/syrian-refugees-not-keen-to-move-to-canada-immediately-ottawa-says/article27561756/) of Syrian refugees is accurate, that means we would have to ask ~397,000 Syrians if they wanted to come to Canada before getting 25,000.

Part of our 'tooting our own horns' is to build a narrative, to get Canadian engaged, and build support for bringing in more. The government, of course, is also interested in self-promotion, but non-partisan writers such as Johnston are above that sort of thing.I sorry big words make your brain sad. :(Well, if you don't like citation-backed refutations of your preferred narratives, you can always go join an echo-chamber sub devoted to salty dank memes and sulk about it.Well, with the Democratic candidates and [some Republican candidates] (http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/21/trans-pacific-partnership-gop-candidates-split-on-deal.html) proclaiming to be against it there's at least some chance the Americans will pull out of it - contingent on one of those winning the White House and keeping their word. If they do that then the deal is effectively dead no matter what Canada does.&gt; But since the senate has always been about representing Canadian demographics gender parity would make about as much sense. 

I would also argue that the Canadian population is large enough and 'merit' is a sufficiently loosely-defined concept that every singe Senate vacancy could be filled with a woman without violating the 'merit-based' mandate.I always wanted to be a meme. [I'm so happy, I'm so happy!] (http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l236/wonkalumps/goonies7.gif)&gt;The same as it's always been: to wait for minority governments to be elected so they can exchange their support for enactment of left-wing policies. They will have more of an impact on policy this way than attempting to broaden their base to win government.

And, if history is any judge, throw that golden opportunity away at the first whiff of being able to win a handful more seats - even if it means most of those policies they collaborated on and professed to support get thrown out by the next government.&gt; This is a waste of time. The cons were right about this one. Of all the gun crimes that occur in Canada, almost none of them involve a long gun and handguns are already registered. This is clearly an issue of politics and not practical policy. 


- [Victims of police-reported violent crime where a firearm was present, 2012] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2014001/article/11925/tbl/tbl02-eng.htm)
 - Rifles/shotguns were present in 19.3% of cases, or 908 incidents. 
 - Rifles/shotguns were responsible for 24% of firearms homicides in 2012, or 33 incidents.


Long guns are in the minority, yes, but it's not 'almost none'.&gt; And do you know what percentage of those guns were legally obtained? 


I was responding to your original assertion that 'almost none of them involve a long gun'. 

&gt;Because it's a very, very small percentage and it's that percentage that would be subject to this registry. 

I don't see anything on police statistics that backs up this claim. Where did you get this information that it's a 'very, very small percentage'? Even if three-quarters of the guns are illegally obtained that's 227 violent crimes involving legal rifles/shotguns in 2012.Well, I guess I live in the riding of the Speaker now. That's a first. I wonder what it will mean, in a practical sense.&gt; If they really cared about the Syrians so much then donate to the refugee camps which are severely underfunded. Most refugees dont want to leave their home. 

Well, the did dole out [$100 million] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/details-government-syrian-refugees-1.3338266) in such aid for a total of nearly $1 billion across this government and (mostly) the previous one. For comparison, the United States - at 10x our population - has contributed a total of [$4.5 billion USD] (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/09/247115.htm), and Germany has given [1 billion euros] (http://www.dw.com/en/germany-earmarks-extra-funds-for-un-refugee-efforts/a-18829047).&gt; The whole refugee situation is optics. If they hadn't have been walking into Europe no one would have cared.

And so caring now is therefore a bad thing?&gt; These are people coming here in for free, not needing to pay taxes, pay for houses, whatever.

[Refugees pay more income tax than millionaire investor immigrants.] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/refugees-pay-more-income-tax-than-millionaire-investor-immigrants-1.2984982) - "By contrast, refugees to Canada start out earning about $17,500 a year, and by the end of their first 10 years, 66 per cent of them are declaring an earned income. Their annual earnings eventually reach a level closer to economic immigrants to Canada, in the $30,000 range"

&gt;Taking in refugees or economic migrants is great to feel good about yourself (and to show the world how"Canada is back!") but it's damaging in the long run and boy, it's going to get ugly.

As with a lot of the alarmist anti-refugee rhetoric there's a distinct lack of supporting data for such a claim. If you've got any, though, feel free to provide it.&gt; Yes, when there are literally people in this country who are doing worse than people in these camps.

You need to do just a [little more research into the conditions in these camps] (http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/11/destitute-syrian-refugees-jordan-lebanon-may-return-to-warzone).

&gt;Spend the billion ending homelessness in Canada.

Canada is more than wealthy enough to do both. By the way, homelessness is a provincial responsibility, not federal.&gt; Yeah its so bad they aren't in a rush to get over here.

The rationale is explained explicitly - they want to return home after the war ends.

&gt;The federal government can allocate funds for provincial programs. Healthcare is a provincial responsibility, there is still Health Canada regs and the health care transfer.

And there is federal funding to [partner communities] (http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/homelessness/designated/index.shtml) for homelessness. Canada, again, is rich enough to do both.

&gt;The fact the natives and homeless live as shitty as they do while advocates have been screaming for help for decades while the red carpet is rolled out for refugees is frankly disgusting. 

You may recall the election we had in October. Both increased refugee levels and increased support for First Nations were endorsed by the selection of a party to govern that advocated for these in their platform.

&gt;Anyone who stopped for a split second to analyze this altruism should have realized this is wrong. Charity starts at home.

Not everyone shares your view. The majority, in fact, do not. 33% of Canadians support 'closing our borders to refugees' while 67% reject the idea according to the Ipsos poll.


&gt;You may recall I don't give a god damn about the election or popular opinion.  That's a cop out.  My entire point was that popular opinion  was riled up to help a bunch of conservative foreigners to the tune of a billion dollars while  Canadians freeze in the streets.  It's Kony 2012  but less excusable. 

Sounds like 1939 reasoning all over again. Where you see 'conservative foreigners' most of the rest of us see human beings.

Canada has taken in refugees before. We'll do it again. Your nationalistic isolationism is a relic.Regan's opposition this time around was fairly mild compared to the caliber of NDP candidates elsewhere in the region. The Conservatives seemed to largely give up on Halifax as well.
&gt;Yeah, except these are the Nazis you want to let in.  The ones who hate Jews.

You really think there are 4 million Nazis in Syrian refugee camps? I really wonder where you get your information from.I've yet to from abolitionists hear why unicameralism would be superior to bicameralism for Canada, especially when bicameralism is used by almost every other federal state in the world. 

I'd also like to hear from those criticizing the current level of reform how they plan to overcome the titanic constitutional roadblocks that would spring up in the face of anything more. It's all well and good to want more substantial changes but this current plan is about as far as the government can go until someone can convince enough provinces to go along with the notion of amending the constitution for this and this alone.&gt; There are bad men in the world but the rare acts of active shooters should not be taken as justification to restrict the freedom of the mass of good men and women in this country.

Firearm ownership is not a right in Canada, it is a privilege. It is subject to 'reasonable' limitations, and the people of Quebec have decided that this is such a reasonable limitation - the most recent poll I can find, while from 2010, says [81% of them support a long gun registry] (http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/two-thirds-of-canadians-back-long-gun-registry-poll).

&gt;There are bad men in the world but the rare acts of active shooters should not be taken as justification to restrict the freedom of the mass of good men and women in this country.

You've yet to explain how this registry 'restricts freedom'.

Regardless, Quebec is forging ahead, and their experience will be interesting for the rest of the country to observe - impartially.Not exactly the most erudite of explanations as to why unicameralism is superior to bicameralism, but then abolitionists like Wall have never really explained their case on that score. Nor, for that matter, come up with a credible plan that actually has any chance of success for amending the constitution. But hey, it's easier to criticize than be constructive.&gt; Long gun-related murders accounted for 23% of all firearm-related murders in 2012, accounting for a rate of 0.1 per 100,000

Whether or not this registry is a good idea, I dispute your point that just because long guns not used in a majority of cases that they don't merit consideration in policymaking. 23% is not a trivial number.If Ontario's coal had been replaced with nuclear instead of this huge web of convoluted renewables the province would have had a much more reliable source of power at lower rates while at the same time eliminating the same amount of greenhouse gasses. We should be building more of the things, but sadly unscientific scaremongering has won the day.Well, all I can say is that since Quebec is bound to forge ahead anyway - courtesy of [massive public support] (http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/two-thirds-of-canadians-back-long-gun-registry-poll), correct or not - we'll see what comes of their experience. The federal version had serious problems but it wasn't in place long enough to say conclusively if it would help or not. Quebec's version will be interesting to watch, as long as everyone keeps their agendas in check while evaluating its results and problems.I agree, but I'd say the Canadian Human Rights Museum would be a somewhat better contender for such an exhibit.Agreed, but then I have that sentiment for every government program.Relevant text:

- "In his efforts to shake off the Spitfire, Faber flew north over Exeter in Devon. After much high-speed manoeuvring, Faber, with only one cannon working, pulled an Immelmann turn into the sun and shot down his pursuer in a head-on attack."
- "Meanwhile, the disorientated Faber now mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel and flew north instead of south. Thinking South Wales was France, he turned towards the nearest airfield - RAF Pembrey. Observers on the ground could not believe their eyes as Faber waggled his wings in a victory celebration, lowered the Focke-Wulf's undercarriage and landed. The Pembrey Duty Pilot, one Sergeant Jeffreys, grabbed a Very pistol and ran from the control tower and jumped onto the wing of Faber's aircraft as it taxied in. Faber was apprehended and later taken to RAF Fairwood Common by Group Captain David Atcherley (twin brother of Richard Atcherley) for interrogation."
- "Whilst a prisoner of war in Canada, Faber managed to successfully convince British authorities that he suffered from epilepsy. Remarkably, it appears the authorities were taken in by his ruse and in 1944 they allowed his repatriation. Shortly after his return, he was again flying in front-line fighter operations."&gt;According to information gathered by Cuellar and his legal team, Drummond is alleged to have caused 4,400 deaths, 420 disappearances and the forced displacement of 55,000 people.

I was a little skeptical of this claim and am still concerned the numbers may be inflated, but in doing some brief research there are corroborating stories to accusations levied at Drummond Coal:

I've tried finding the full quote, but I'm having trouble doing so.

That, and all the other 'citations' about this guy's supposed 'disturbing Islamic leanings' are from sources of questionable validity like 'frontpagemag', 'PJmedia', and 'Militant Islam Monitor'.

This whole thing is a tangle of unsubstantiated allegations feeding back into itself. Unless an actual reputable news organization can be referenced anywhere this is completely untrustworthy.I have to wonder if they were live-commenting on it if James' reaction would be a heck of a lot different than Michael Huber's famous exclamations at Shenmue 3 getting announced - though maybe not quite as manic.&gt; Firearms are already highly regulated objects in this country. There is no point in Quebec borrowing more money to reconstruct a database that has already failed to the tune of billions of dollars.

Your equivalency of 81% of Quebecers to Nazis aside, the long gun registry was not in operation long enough determine if it succeeded or failed.

Are Canada's gun laws needlessly obtuse? Yes, but that's a separate issue.I have no interest in defending Ontario's government, all the more so in light of recent revelations, but 'everything'? Really? This piece abandons all pretense of balance.

Saying they're a bad government or that other options are better is perfectly valid but to claim there's literally zero redeeming qualities of any administration anywhere in Canada is unhelpfully hyper-partisan.- Alberta can't pretend its anemic plan is a major accomplishment. 
- BC can't stall its carbon tax just because it's held up as an example to the world. 
- Quebec and Ontario can't join some byzantine cap and trade agreement that will exempt swaths of industries and claim they've made progress - same with Manitoba. 
- Saskatchewan can't pretend the problem can be cured by economic growth or unworkable carbon capture schemes. 
- Atlantic Canada can't keep doing nothing.

Despite his promises to rebuild the relationship with the provinces these are the hard truths Trudeau's going to have to lay on them if he's serious about this.- From [1971-1993] (http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Canada--Nuclear-Power/) we added most of our ~85-100TWh of nuclear generating capacity over 22 years (it ranges between ~85-100TWh currently depending on maintenance schedules).
- If this had continued in a linear fashion over the next 22 years (1993-2015) nuclear generating capacity would have doubled, adding another ~85-100TWh. It could have replaced the following:




Power Type | [2014 Capacity] (http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a47) | [CO2 per kWh (lb/kg)] (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=74&amp;t=11) | Total CO2

Cutting emissions by 77.64Mt would have brought us ~52% of the way to achieving our Kyoto target of emissions 6% below 1990 levels.

Naturally we very likely would not have been able to shut down every single coal, gas, and oil plant in that time without significant expense, but it's interesting to think about. Nuclear does not deserve its bad reputation.- From [1971-1993] (http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Canada--Nuclear-Power/) we added most of our ~85-100TWh of nuclear generating capacity over 22 years (it ranges between ~85-100TWh currently depending on maintenance schedules).

Naturally we very likely would not have been able to shut down every single coal, gas, and oil plant in that time without significant expense, but it's interesting to think about. Nuclear does not deserve its bad reputation.The EPA gives their totals in pounds. I just wanted to list both the pounds and the equivalent in metric. You can mentally replace the / with an = if it helps.For sure, but for my little exercise I still had room left over after eliminating all coal, so I tossed in other generating methods to fill it up.&gt; Serious question: do we have enough Uranium to just do that forever. I know that Nuclear power is extremely energy dense but it's not infinite. Surely there's some limit on Uranium supply that doubling our rate of consumption will halve?

According to Scientific American there is enough 'economically accessible' uranium to run the world's reactors for [200 years] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/). At 2,800TWH worldwide capacity, It would seem that Canada adding 100TWh would reduce this by ~7 years.

However one thing to keep in mind is that Canada's CANDU reactors can use natural uranium, not low-enriched uranium, which is what the 200 years is calculated on. In order to produce 1 tonne of LEU uranium you need 10 tonnes of natural uranium. Therefore the impact of Canada's increase in capacity may well have been less than that ~7 years.Per the link above the world consumes 70,000 metric tonnes per year of uranium to keep its 2,800TWh capacity running. To keep things simple, Canada's ~100TWh current capacity into 2,800TWh would consume  2,500 metric tonnes per year. Adding another ~100TWh would raise that to 5,000 metric tonnes per year.

In 2014 Canada produced [9,331.5 metric tonnes of uranium] (http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/uranium-nuclear/7695), mostly from Saskatchewan. 85% of it was exported. 

Canada's proven resources per the above link are 490,000 metric tonnes. This is enough to run our hypothetical 200TWh capacity for 98 years. 

Note that given that CANDU reactors run on natural uranium and these consumption numbers are for 10:1 LEU uranium, this number is probably very conservative and the reactors could probably be run for much longer.
No worries friend, blame it on it being Friday. I could probably have been clearer.He's said it elsewhere as part of the story that led to this tweet:

- **Sask. Premier Brad Wall still in favour of abolishing the Senate** - [CBC, Dec. 3, 2015] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/brad-wall-senate-reform-1.3349856): "People may ask, 'Why is your position still abolition?' My answer to that, today, would be: It's 2015," he said.&gt; Wouldn't natural gas still be necessary to support variance in demand? As I understand it, nuclear provides a stable baseline and natural gas is fired up at peak hours.

Actually Ontario's nuclear reactors are capable of operating at anywhere down to 60% load / zero output indefinitely. It does take a while to get back up to full power, so they tend to move in big 300MW baseload 'chunks' as opposed to smaller increments like 80MW that are typical of other thermal plants. This is a bit problematic when something that's unpredictable, like wind power, suddenly kicks in to flow into the grid.

However more modern plants are designed to be 'load-following', capable of adjusting to peak demand and off hours as easily as other thermal plants. This sort of thing is prevalent in France and Germany. Ontario's nuclear plants can be retrofitted with this capacity if desired. A really good writeup of it can be found [here] (http://atomicinsights.com/ontarios-candus-can-be-more-flexible-than-natural-gas-and-hydro/).If they find themselves with an excess of parking spaces they will have no problem renting them out in that location. If they need them for new tenants later on they can just terminate the agreement with any non-resident parkers.No mention whatsoever of Canada's other contributions. No acknowledgement that this new commitment by the UK more than offsets Canada's 6 aircraft. Isn't there usually an obligation to at least acknowledge the other side of the debate?That isn't really an adequate explanation. You could argue that the House of Commons is just as dysfunctional by that standard in any majority with governments whipping members on all sorts of bills. 'Legitimacy' is also open to interpretation - is our judiciary illegitimate because it's appointed rather than elected? It certainly has a huge impact on government policy.

It's a little disingenuous to suggest the Senate has never produced anything of value or advanced any sort of meaningful amendments to legislation. If we're going to have a real debate over whether we should abolish it or not we can't pretend it doesn't exist at all, otherwise why even bother abolishing it? The dollar value of concessions the provinces would demand would probably be astronomical, dwarfing the Senate's $90M annual cost.Between this, the cost overruns for the surface combatants, the lacklustre design of the AOPS ships (which likely won't be built in the numbers promised), and the problems around replenishment ship replacement the shipbuilding strategy is descending into 'debacle' territory after originally being held up as a model for defence procurement. How did it go so apparently wrong?&gt; I spend my time thinking about food and rent and I bet at some point it crossed that fucker's mind to hire a third nannie. 

It is scandalous how he's increasing the Prime Minister's household staff to six. I mean Stephen Harper managed to get by with only six! [[1] (http://globalnews.ca/news/2375755/trudeau-to-keep-nannies-office-says/)]

This sort of out-of-control growth in government expenses will ruin us.And when the Kurds turn around and say they want their own country, while Turkey, Iraq, and Syria say no, what do we do? Such a massive level of military support would create expectations of us backing such an endeavour, emboldening them to take that step. Supporting them over the objection of the nations that would lose territory to them borders on an act of war.&gt; When did I say that?

Right about here:

&gt;&gt;Canada has function [sic] unicameralism now.

Meaning you believe Canada has only one house that actually does anything, meaning you believe the Senate does nothing.&gt; Is this a teaser to election reforms or is this usually how a speaker is chosen? 

Previously the Speaker was chosen via multi-round balloting. They'd vote, knock off the person with the fewest votes, wait an hour, and do it again. Repeat until there's only 2 left and have one last vote. This time they switched to ranked ballots so there was only one round.

Trudeau has said he likes ranked ballots but is open to other voting methods. In most polls some form of proportional representation is more popular than ranked ballots. We'll see what we wind up with.Let's have a rundown of the articles on CBC.ca right now. Not just CBC News, but the main portal site:

I wouldn't worry about it. A dabbling of fluff pieces on CBC won't hurt anyone.
&gt; What are better alternatives to bicameralism?

In democracies you either have two houses (bicameralism) or one (unicameralism). Every single federated state in the world (countries with provinces, states, etc.) uses a bicameral system to provide representation both on a riding level and a subnational unit level - with the exception of Iraq (who has an upper house on paper but chaos in their parliament meant they never got around to implementing it) and the Federated States of Micronesia.

Nobody has yet made a convincing case why ditching the upper house and sticking with one, contrary to how pretty much every other democracy does it, is a good idea. Most just wrapped up in notions of why the Senate is 'bad' without explaining why their preferred alternative is 'good'.&gt; Further, I'd argue that just because no one else has tried a system of government isn't a reason to not do it. If that's the case, democracy might not have emerged during the Age of Enlightenment.

If we're going to go messing with the fundamental nature of our democracy we need something more robust to go on than that. There needs to be some positive, redeeming quality to having one house instead of two. So far advocates of abolition have only focused on the negatives of the current system without a single mention anywhere of the positives of unicameralism. That's not a reason to act, and the onus always has to be on those advocating change for why their proposed solution will be superior.

&gt;Anyway, what Raitt said was politician-speak, but not wrong.

I'll have to disagree on that one. Raitt didn't say that she disagreed with the accounting methodology, she implied that the Liberals have spent ~$5 billion dollars in 4 weeks. That's how it would read to anyone not following the intricacies of how surpluses and deficits are calculated and unaware of how accounting can generate two different scenarios using the same numbers - as in, the majority of the population. 

I'd have no problems with criticisms of the methodology the Liberals employed but this implies much more than that.Some answers:

This is already [being looked into] (http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2014/11/03/drug_use_tests_for_canadian_drivers_coming_soon.html)

&gt;How do we make it clear to Canadian financial institutions that servicing marijuana business is not risky?

The stories we hear in the United States about banks not wanting to deal with marijuana businesses is because marijuana is still illegal federally there. In Canada with national legalization there will be no comparable barrier. The bigger question is if these banks will face difficulty in the United States (or other countries) for servicing those involved in the business of a drug that remains illegal there.

&gt;What about criminals currently in jail for low level, repeated marijuana crimes?

&gt;What about criminals currently in jail for high level marijuana crimes?

&gt;What about expunging criminal records for low level, repeated marijuana crimes?

&gt;What about expunging criminal records for high level marijuana crimes?

On the campaign trail Trudeau said a Liberal government would 'look at' [overturning convictions for marijuana crimes] (http://www.straight.com/news/512956/justin-trudeau-liberal-government-would-look-overturning-convictions-marijuana-crimes). No further details on that appear to be currently available.

&gt;Will we export marijuana to other countries?

&gt;Will we import marijuana from other countries and will any duty apply to protect Canadian producers?

Health Canada currently says the import and export of marijuana would ['undermine public health and safety objectives'] (http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/info/licencedproducer-producteurautorise/import-eng.php). Whether this will change is an open question.Exactly what lasting consequences have arisen from Canada's refusal to join the 'Coalition of the Willing' in invading Iraq in 2004? That time we weren't even participating in any ancillary activities like training, just supplying some personnel on exchange.&gt;Since taking power we've gone from a surplus, to a surprise 3 billion deficit.

That's not the case. We haven't 'gone from' one financial position to another - the underlying information remains the same. It's the interpretation of it that's changed.

&gt;It's not up to the Conservatives to explain how the Liberals arrived there. They're the government now, they have to explain themselves. 

It would be a little too convenient for them to not have to defend their original estimate, though.

&gt; So far their explanation is that the "cupboard is bare" from the last government. Who's being more dishonest here?

Without seeing the full books for myself - and suddenly gaining the expertise necessary to come up with a reasonable interpretation of them - I wouldn't pretend to know. Realistically I doubt either one's being especially 'dishonest', but both are probably pushing things as far as they can within an ethical range to make the picture suit their chosen narratives.&gt; In Canada, it would require the federal government along with the unanimous consent of the provinces to make a comparable change. I expect pigs to learn to fly before Canada manages such a feat.

I hear Quebec's on board.&gt;This shit doesn't make a difference reporting real stories does. 24/7, not 12/5 and the rest is fluff garbage. 

CBC isn't just news, you know. If you want to completely shut down their entertainment side of things, that's a whole other topic.

It's fine to not like this specific article but there's really no reason to get worked up over it - there's no evidence of a 'slippery slope' here.&gt;I want to help homeless, but don't know how. This seems like a great way to restore their independence and generate some self-confidence.

For the right kind of person, yes. There are so many different reasons why people are homeless that there's unfortunately no one single answer to solve the problem for everyone - but that's no reason why we shouldn't be trying to solve the problem for as many as we can. Just because a program doesn't help absolutely everyone doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile.


Kudos to you for taking an interest.CBC has an ombudsman for just such complaints. Throwing up some public denigration of the CBC rather than even bothering with the ombudsman process demonstrates Irving is more interested in controlling the optics than establishing the truth.
&gt;Canadian politics lack ambition. In America there seems to be a "no problem too big to solve" or "no challenge too tough to overcome" attitude. 

The United States is not exactly an upstanding model of functional government. They don't often bring any substantial changes to votes on federal levels because of the complete dysfunction of their hyper partisan system. The last major change they made was Obamacare - a squeaker of a vote that was hardly a major overhaul of the broken US healthcare system. TPP barely got the 'fast track' approval it needed and now many presidential candidates are promising to undo it.

If Canadian politics lacks ambition, American politics is delusional in pretending major change is actually possible down there with the sheer chaos of partisan rhetoric.I would rather we select it in a fair and open competition than the previous method of rigging the game so only one aircraft would qualify. Just as the shipbuilding contract is melting down into a disaster, any attempt to reform our procurement process is welcome, even if we wind up with the same aircraft in this case. I just hope our new government can pull it off.The previous selection process was a farce. A rigged game where only the F-35 was going to qualify. The Conservatives, long content to criticize their predecessors, have turned out to be at the very least just as inept as them when it comes to procurement.

We might wind up with the F-35 but criticisms of the deceptive means the previous government used to select it are valid. That sort of methodology cannot be allowed to continue.Yeah, that's what's known as a 'rigged game' of the sort the previous government engaged in: only the F-35, we'll tailor our requirements to make it so, and downvote - I mean, denigrate - anyone who disagrees!

Of course pressing that satisfying little down arrow is way easier than listening to the [Auditor General] (http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201204_02_e_36466.html):

- "PWGSC did not fully carry out its role as the government\u2019s procurement authority. Although it was not engaged by National Defence until late in the decision-making process, PWGSC endorsed the key decision to sole source the acquisition of the F-35 in the absence of required documentation and completed analyses. By that time, practically speaking, Canada was too involved with the aircraft and the JSF Program to run a fair competition."
- "Since National Defence intended to recommend the purchase of the F-35 without competition, it had to identify and justify an appropriate exception to competitive tendering set out in the Government Contracts Regulations. One of the permitted exceptions is that \u201cthe nature of the work is such that it would not be in the public interest to solicit bids.\u201d Up until late May 2010, National Defence planned to use this exception, based in part on the conclusions from the 2008 options analysis and on its argument that it needed a fighter jet with fifth generation capability. While this exception was supported by PWGSC, ultimately the use of this exception was not supported inter-departmentally. National Defence then decided to use another of the permitted exceptions, that \u201conly one person [that is, contractor(s)] is capable of performing the contract,\u201d and the decision-making documents were reworded accordingly."
- "To support the use of this exception, National Defence was required to identify its operational requirements and to provide a full justification to PWGSC. Neither was provided to PWGSC in a timely manner, despite several requests from PWGSC. PWGSC was not given a copy of the statement of operational requirement until August 2010, well after the government had announced its decision to purchase the F-35 in July 2010. In fact, the statement was approved by the Chief of the Air Staff after decision-making documents related to the government\u2019s July 2010 announcement had been signed and submitted for consideration by ministers. Then, according to National Defence, the formal options analysis was completed (as required as part of the Project Options Analysis Phase as shown in Exhibit 2.5), which concluded that the F-35 was the only available aircraft that could meet the mandatory requirements of the Canadian Forces. The conclusion was cited as the basis for the government\u2019s decision to purchase the F-35 without competition."
- "**We found that National Defence engaged PWGSC late in the decision-making process and hampered PWGSC\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities as contracting authority to ensure the integrity of the procurement process.** "

The F-35 might be the right aircraft but the 2010 process was a shit-show that must be rectified by actually following procurement regulations - even if we wind up with the same plane.

Read a little and do some independent critical thinking before replying.

*Or not. Anything to stifle those dissenting opinions, I guess.I don't have an answer for this, but I did come across an interesting paper by a parliamentary intern in 2011 attempting to [quantify the impacts of heckling in the House of Commons] (http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=205&amp;art=1447).Well... two years, but yeah. This should be removed unless there's some recent update. I'm not the world's biggest Harper fan but this is just silly.Why, exactly would he meet with them there rather than beforehand or afterwards? Isn't the purpose of this conference to meet with members of the international community, not with your own delegation - a few minor side consultations aside?All of which is negated by the failure of procedure previously outlined:

- "PWGSC did not fully carry out its role as the government\u2019s procurement authority. Although it was not engaged by National Defence until late in the decision-making process, **PWGSC endorsed the key decision to sole source the acquisition of the F-35 in the absence of required documentation and completed analyses.**"

How can a fair procurement conclusion be reached by National Defence when a) it's not their job to handle procurement and b) PWGSC issued support before having all of the data?

Obviously Harper was caught out or he wouldn't have bothered [pulling the responsibility from DND in the immediate aftermath of the report] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/dnd-officials-still-want-f-35-despite-controversy-cost-concerns/article4104386/).

There is no way to spin the selection of the F-35 as anything other than a mess of broken rules and violated procedures.Why are no credible news organizations in Canada making any of these claims? Surely if there's any truth to him being a 'Hamas supporter' we'd have seen something from at least one of them.- Military procurements are the mandate of Public Works, not National Defence.
- Despite that, National Defence was tasked with this file. They originally decided not to hold any sort of competition and sole source the F-35.
- To make it legitimate, they told Public Works to sign off on it. There are strict criteria Public Works has to follow to agree to sole source something without a bidding process. National Defence told Public Works to use one of those criteria, then decided that it wasn't applicable and told them to use another.
- Public Works did not receive all the information and analysis necessary to properly make a decision. Despite this they signed off on the sole sourcing of the F-35, essentially letting themselves be ordered into it instead of doing their mandated jobs.

All of this is in the Auditor General's report.

As for why they did it, it's hard to say. I'm sure part of it is because National a defence really does believe the F-35 is the best aircraft, but there also has to be a lot of pressure from the Canadian defence industry who risked losing out on work promised them by Lockheed. Regardless, the entire selection process was fatally flawed and has to be restarted.

Harper claimed to do this in 2012 after the Auditor General's report came out. He pulled the responsibility for the file from National Defence and gave it back to Public Works, where it belonged. Public Works did an 'options analysis' looking at more aircraft - not a True competition mind you - and was criticized for making the criteria specifically tailored so only the F-35 could possibly be chosen.&gt; The fact that he presided over a hate rally where Israelis were called "nazis" and Jewish children were threatened, though - that's a fucking news story. 

You are aware that this rally occurred [after his tenure] (http://cnews.canoe.com/CNEWS/Canada/2006/08/13/pf-1752447.html), correct? Alghabra headed the organization from 2004-2005. I might add that in 2005 the Canadian Arab Federation was invited to the [Conservative party convention] (http://www.24news.ca/the-news/canada-news/157635-court-backs-conservatives-funding-cut-to-anti-semitic-arab-group) in Montreal.I wouldn't claim to be expert enough to say, just that the process to choose that aircraft should follow the rules.&gt; What was his involvement with the organization after that, would be the next obvious question.

Given that by December of 2005 he was a Liberal candidate and became an MP in January 2006 the answer would have to be none, at least in any sort of guidance role.

If there's accusations against this guy let's have some actual evidence. So far everything here is completely unsubstantiated from very questionable 'news' sources.&gt; Where do we go to start talking about research into making electric vehicles feasible in Canada? It seems stupid to talk about anything else until we address that. Perhpas this comment will get removed but this seemed like as good a place as any to put it. 

Unless the electricity filling the car's battery is generated by a non-carbon emitting source like hydro, nuclear, wind, or solar then an electric car is of minimal use.  It's a good thing to be talking about as it will require heavy investment and upgrading of electricity infrastructure to cope with widespread electric car demand, but it's only really part of the solution right now in areas that have low to zero carbon electricity generation.&gt; In short, electric vehicles can make more efficient use of fossil fuels due to the efficiency of electric motors and centralized generation.

Sure, but what about the incremental environmental impact of massively ramping up production of lithium-ion batteries over existing levels? Aluminum-ion batteries are promising, but until they enter mass production lithium-ion is all we've got.

&gt;Besides, in the Canadian context it's moot since a large majority of our electricity does in fact come from hydroelectric and nuclear.

Which is why I clarified 'in areas with low to zero carbon electricity generation'. Nova Scotia, where I'm located, is most definitely not one of them.&gt; Actually, Canada already has a fairly low carbon load from the electricity sector. Fossil fuels only make up 22% of our electricity generation. Most of Canada runs on hydro and nuclear. 

I did clarify 'in areas with low to zero carbon electricity generation' - which, as you can see by my flag, is not an area I live in.

&gt;You're right, switching to electric will require a boost to the electricity infrastructure, but we already make more than we need, enough to sell to the states.

Adding an electric car is like adding [one-third of a house] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-electric-cars-wreck-the-grid/). There are [~4.9 million households in Ontario] (http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/census/cenhi11-5.html) and [~11.4 million vehicles] (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/trade14b-eng.htm). If a significant percentage of the latter convert to electricity it will require a major upgrade in generating capacity and delivery infrastructure - not just between cities but within them as well.&gt; Well for those that accuse Harper of creating a "structural deficit" by cutting the GST, i'm genuinely curious what they're views are on this. 

I'd rather Trudeau temper the tax cut to equate to revenue earned or cancel the whole scheme altogether. 

Canadians voted to restore a certain level of services that existed prior to Harper's administration - not all of them, but some of them. That sentiment could be accurately said to be expressed by both NDP and a majority of Liberal voters. If those voters were honest about what that really means then they should expect a degree of increased government revenues corresponding to the elevated service levels they want, and not just on 'the rich' or 'corporations'. Both Trudeau and Mulcair should have made that argument on the campaign trail. We saw how deficit spending was a winner for Trudeau in defiance of all the dire predictions - I'm not sure the conventional wisdom that advocating for some tax increases is political suicide is entirely accurate.&gt; That's much more easily managed than carbon output from ICEs all over the roads. It's also part of the reason why Tesla is so keen on their Gigafactory.

Well, a study from Norway calculated the life-cycle 'global warming potential' of an electric vehicle deriving its power from natural gas as [12% less than a conventional gas-powered car] (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full) and 'break even' over diesel. Electric vehicles charged with coal power were calculated at 17% to 27% worse than gas-powered cars.

This isn't to say that electric vehicles are bad, just that they aren't a panacea and they have potential drawbacks that have to be factored into decision-making.Africa needs reliable power - it's the unreliability of electricity supplies that aids in crippling their economy. Right now I'm not sure renewables can solve that dilemma.

Building carbon-free power sources in developing areas is a fantastic way to prevent future emissions growth, but honestly I would rather see the government building nuclear reactors in developing countries that already have them - South Africa for instance, and especially India - and recovering at least some of the cost of them through the sale of electricity in order to build more.&gt; Hmm, I wonder if he will ask Senators and Supreme Court Justices to step aside because Trudeau didn't appoint them either.... I am guess no, because that would be wrong, but somehow this is OK?

Can you point to any Senators or Supreme Court Justices who have been pre-appointed to take office sometime in the future? If not then your analogy is not valid.Mulcair, however, adopted the same tactic as Trudeau - going after politically-palatable targets. Trudeau chose the rich. Mulcair chose corporations. Neither of them wanted to ask the average taxpayer for more in exchange for those increased level of services. To quote Mulcair, ["they are already paying their fair share."] (http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/13/mulcair-wont-raise-your-taxes)&gt;A Supreme Court Justice was appointed to start August 31, 2015- after Parliament was dissolved and the caretaker conventions had kicked in.

Not exactly [non-controversially] (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2645025), if you recall.I was talking about tax increases, not tax cuts. If you want to include the whole raft of them then it muddies the picture considerably. Do we offset Mulcair's corporate tax hike against his proposed [small business tax cut] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ndp-rolls-out-three-point-economic-plan-to-bolster-business/article22650298/), then? What about the tax breaks he promised to [the auto industry and aerospace] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ndps-mulcair-promises-financial-incentives-for-auto-industry/article26272733/)?

Your original comment was about increased levels of taxation. Adding in tax decreases in other areas complicates things, but it's not entirely appropriate to suggest only one party was proposing to do so.Adjusting Canada's emissions to do our part towards actually meeting that goal won't win Trudeau any friends in the provinces. All of them will have to significantly step up their plans to meet it, including Alberta and BC.You replied to my comment about increasing taxation to pay for increased levels of services rather than the article. I guess I made the mistake of assuming you were addressing my points rather than those in the article.If we're really going meet the Conservatives' climate change targets - the one the Liberals have set as a 'floor' - then this cap-and-trade scheme had better be far more aggressive than what's been advertised thus far.

Of course BC will have to stop resting on its laurels and we're going to have to stop pretending Alberta's new plan is sufficient as well, not to mention chastising Saskatchewan and Atlantic Canada into doing anything at all.Here's an odd question I've had bandying about my brain for a few days: if parliamentarians chose the speaker with a FPTP system would there not have been a pretty good chance we'd now have a Conservative speaker?

Assuming most Conservatives voted for their own (Bruce Stanton) and there was some split among the Liberals and NDP between the three Liberal candidates odds are pretty respectable, I would think, that Stanton would have won the post.

Kind of an interesting thought experiment that might have some relevance to discussions of current electoral reform proposals.&gt; The election of the Speaker has never been a straight FPTP election, though. Prior to using IRV, there was just plain old runoff voting with multiple ballots. And in days of yore, it was just a rubber stamp on someone nominated by the PM.

Yeah, I know the previous ballots were multiple-round voting, it was more a thought experiment than anything else.&gt; Let's be clear: I'm saying that you're drawing a False equivalence between the Liberals and NDP on tax policy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Raising taxes on the very rich to partially pay for a tax cut for the well-off is not equivalent to raising taxes on corporations to pay for daycare.

The equivalence is that both are far more politically palatable targets than the 'average taxpayer', as I have stated previously. The equivalence also is that neither measure on its own will fully pay for the increased level of services that the voters for either party expect.

Yes the NDP measure likely would have produced greater revenues than Trudeau's will but both are political calculations rather than a frank policy discussion.&gt;At least Mulcair's tax plan want revenue neutral. And turns out Trudeau's wasn't even that. It's revenue - nnegative. 

Depends on your scale. Relative to their entire platforms the tax measures in both are quite revenue-'negative'.&gt; If your complaint is that neither party promised a general across the board tax hike, and consequently both are blameworthy, I would agree with you to a point

My complaint is that no political party is willing to have a frank discussion about the necessary levels of revenue to sustain the services Canadians have stated are important to them.

&gt;but insist you're missing the more important point of difference, which is that one measure is explicitly contracting government revenue, while the other seeks to expand it. Hard to get a clearer comparison than that.

What's your scope, though? Tax increases, tax increases less tax cuts, or the sum of the entire platform? Mine was the first, but the last is also a valid way of analyzing projected costs versus revenues. Yours seems to be the middle, tax increases less tax cuts, which seems oddly specific, restrictive, and not particularly informative in and of itself as an isolated measure.Well, then I can imagine they won't be too pleased when they find out that in order to actually have a positive impact on the environment they'll have to do a whole heck of a lot more than slow the growth of GHG emissions. The NDP's plan can be at best summarized as 'less bad than it could have been otherwise'.&gt; Yet another surprise that the Liberals weren't able to see coming when making their election platform but suddenly can see clearly now that they've been in government for 6 weeks.

Is it not possible that they have access to superior quality information now that they are in government? If it were a simple case of dishonesty why would they confess it now? Why wouldn't they just stick to their projections as long as possible and dismiss their critics, adopting the methodology of the previous government?

&gt; For a party that claims to be for evidence based policy 

This line's going to pop up every time the government does something its opponents disagree with, isn't it?

We don't live in a black-and-white world where perfect information is always available. It's possible to make a different, or even wrong, conclusion and still not violate the notion of 'evidence-based policy'.

&gt;it hardly seems adequate to just throw numbers out there without doing a sufficient amount of homework. 

It's a little far-fetched to suggest any political party 'just throws numbers out there' given the level of expertise they have access to.

&gt;I'm sure they have more access to staff and information now but 3rd party organizations seem to have predicted this without having access to government resources.

Show me any policy any government has ever come up with and I'll show you third parties who say it will go great and others who say it will be a disaster.

&gt;I also don't really think they should be given credit for coming clean that several key parts of their platform were not realistic.

Just because something doesn't work out doesn't mean the original assumptions were 'not realistic'. But no, they shouldn't be given credit for the policy. The change to a government that is actually transparent and up front about it, though, is a significant one that should be encouraged.&gt; Does anyone have details on exactly what provisions this new policy regarding India has, in terms of guaranteeing that our uranium will not be used to manufacture nuclear weapons?

Because Australia has [way fewer restrictions on the uranium they are selling India] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/australian-uranium-could-end-up-in-indias-nuclear-weapons-program), seemingly not really requiring any kind of prior consent to enrich the uranium they're selling them. Canada has specified 'no military use', so why would they bother using Canadian uranium for weapons when Australia's given them implicit permission to already? I don't know about rare - CP Rail's current hostile bid for a US railway would likely be rejected by regulators if it made it that far. The only thing preventing big Canadian telecoms from buying out smaller rivals for their precious spectrum is the near-certainty of rejection on competition grounds.Well, my dream of a referendum on electoral reform just got gutted, it would seem. Pity that. I hope this government comes up with something materially consultative at least.That's not exactly a thorough refute of the claims in this article. Why is investment down and employment down as the corporate tax rate declines? What economic measure has actually improved as a direct result of corporate tax rate cuts? We're continually told that corporate taxes are harmful - why has their reduction not led to superior outcomes?Whether or not this is the right move overall it's a positive that they at least took their time in winding down the mission rather than pull them out immediately purely for optics. That's probably why our allies' responses haven't been negative.&gt; *by we I mean collectively as "The West"

Since the collective forces deployed by "the West" are increasing overall then a change in Canada's minor contribution is immaterial.Presumably they felt the raft of social spending and changes to the child tax benefit in their platform better addressed the needs of the 'poorest tax filers' than a token income tax cut.

According to [MoneySense] (http://www.moneysense.ca/taxes/the-real-winners-of-the-new-liberal-tax-policies/) 'low and middle-income families will actually come out ahead' after the cumulative effect of tax changes and changes to the child care benefit are taken into account.Have you ever tried living an 'upper middle class' lifestyle on $45K a year? Most people earning that level of income aren't typically struggling but they're not exactly wealthy either.&gt;Except Trudeau spent much of the campaign criticizing Harper in this area and promising "real change" to rebuild the relationship.

Obama cares about his legacy, and that's not going to be cemented by a bombing campaign against ISIS. He's way more interested in the climate change file, and is more than willing to trade off Canada's 6 jets for a more cooperative administration in that area. So is most of Europe, for that matter. With the Republicans descending into self-destructive farce it's looking more likely that they will lose the next election, establishing this trend for the foreseeable future.

The decision on TPP will have way, way more impact than what we do in this military campaign. What, exactly, are the current impacts on Canada from our refusal to join the Iraq campaign? And since we're talking long-term impacts regarding our ISIS mission participation, what are the current impacts on Canada from our refusal to participate in the Vietnam war?Are you suggesting abolishing reserves? Expanding them? Assimilating natives? Giving them more autonomy?

Has there been any indication that aboriginals even want to have that discussion? If not, what right do we have to impose it on them?The NDP can be an effective opposition not only by lambasting the government out when it screws up or makes boneheaded decisions - and it most certainly will - but also by being a constructive force.

Contrary to the case in with the previous government there are some policy areas in which the Liberals and NDP overlap. If the NDP can propose changes and amendments to policies advanced by the Liberals, and do so in a a constructive, non-demagogic way then they can better advance both the interests of their own supporters and help build a better parliamentary process. It will put the ball in the Liberals' court, forcing them to respond to these efforts to engage the government and either work with the NDP in these instances or explain why they won't.

Criticism is incredibly important and 'angry Mulcair' will continue to be of service to Canada when this government transgresses, but the NDP can do a lot more than that to be an effective opposition. It just might help them transcend their third-party status in the process.&gt; People earning below $45k will see no benefit.

Depends on their family circumstances. Single / childless people earning below $45k will see no tax benefit but the changes to the child care tax credit will more than outpace the tax cut + child care tax credit changes for higher income individuals.

&gt;What would you call the band between $45k and $200k?

Beats me, and again it depends on individual circumstances. If you're single and childless, maybe $45k is upper-middle class. If you're making $45k but you're the sole income-earner with a family of 2 or more, maybe you're lower-middle class. That's the definition [MoneySense came up with] (http://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/are-you-in-the-middle-class/) anyway.Well, feel free to point out the official Canadian definition of middle class then. I think you'll find it's just a buzz word manipulated by people to suit their own agendas rather than a quantifiable category.&gt; As a good first start, I think we should amend the Indian Act and transfer all reserve lands to the collective ownership of the bands living on them. Then we should begin amending the Indian Act and making reserves their own municipal-style of government run and administered by the bands living on them.

Should this not be something that we consult aboriginals on first to get their consent for such a drastic change? Unilaterally imposing things on First Nations has a really poor history in this country, after all.So we can anticipate no material consequences from withdrawing from ISIS airstrikes? That's something I certain agree with.&gt; The fact he made one to address defeating ISIS says a lot about the importance this has not only to him, but to the American people. Not to mention the importance of the air strikes, as he singled out those who stepped up their commitment. 

What plays well day-to-day and what's more significant long-term are not necessarily one in the same.

&gt;Ironically you should mention climate change as well, since we only contribute 2% of GHG's and any action we take is a symbolic show of unity. 

Or, to use a different metric, we're the 12th-highest in the world per capita and the largest GHG emitter in the G7 on a per-capita basis. Any action we take is a material show of how a high-polluting nation can reform its ways.&gt;"Speeches from the Oval Office have often been reserved for major events of national or international importance, usually relating to the economy or military and foreign policy." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oval_Office_addresses

Let's see what Obama's speeches have been about:

- Gulf oil spill: A major crisis at the time, but fairly ephemeral overall
- End of US combat operations in Iraq: A milestone, sure, but exactly a victory
- Addressing the threat of terrorism: Terrorism's been around for 100 years. Sure isn't going to end on Obama's watch.

ISIS is just the latest manifestation of terrorism. It will diminish, as Al-Qaeda, the Tamil Tigers, and the IRA did before it. Something new will rise in its place, diminish, and so on. The US isn't defined by that one organization nor its fight against it.

&gt;So in other words, it's symbolic. The planet doesn't care about per capita emissions. 

No, the climate is impacted by the sum total of emissions. Every region of the planet can accurately say its own emissions are not in the majority and any action it takes will be symbolic, from Canada to the Dailan Industrial Zone in China to the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Estates in India. They can all share in your excuse to do nothing because their individual actions are 'symbolic'. That's the surest way to ensure climate change isn't taken seriously.

Canada can't behave as you advocate. Comparing this to the proven uselessness of military action in the Middle East is a completely False equivalency.Canada's contribution is a [fraction of 5% of non-US airstrikes] (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/53e21070-9987-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html#axzz3tkkLzGKC). The 8 aircraft the RAF deployed last week already more than make up for Canada's share, and 6 of those are a much more modern aircraft.

The millions of Canadians who served in the conflicts you mention are simply not remotely comparable to Canada's small contribution. What we have provided to date just isn't large enough to merit the kind of consideration you're talking about.

There is no capability that Canada's 6 aging aircraft offers that the United States is lacking.

As for financial considerations without knowing what Canada's new role will be it's difficult to say. The United States seems content to take on the vast majority of the action, though, so it doesn't seem to be a concern of theirs.Given the leadership of the Republican party is descending into self-destructive farce I wouldn't peg their chances as 'very good' at all. Even if they do win there were no major economic issues as a direct result of Iraq between Chretien and Bush, just a lot of hot air about threats. I think we can deal with our own version of 'freedom fries'.Keep in mind that there's a lot of layers between the BoC rate and the rate actual bank customers get. Even if the BoC goes somewhat negative banks will still charge a positive interest rate.If they lose this case Wal-Mart should be required to pay the fine in Canadian Tire money. Canadian Tire gives out [0.4% of your purchase] (http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/canadian-tire-corp-will-roll-out-new-digital-loyalty-program-next-month) in Canadian Tire money. They'd have to buy $125 million worth of Canadian Tire merchandise to get $500,000 worth of Canadian Tire bucks.And well it should be because Trudeau's goal is quite ambitious as compared to the anemic plans of the provinces. I do take issue with the fact that's it's kind of early to be calling this one, though. To quote the article itself:

- "Does Justin Trudeau have a plan to reduce GHG emissions?"
- "'So if they have a plan, they haven't told anyone about it.'"

The article's speculation isn't irrational, but it's still speculation.Spoiler alert, the Energized Dairy Gathering Absorption Rig was a huge money-losing project for Monarch Labs, completely blowing its research budget.

Some say it's a debt for the Mad King to deal with, but I say that E.D.G.A.R.'s the one in the hole.&gt;Wait, Jack Layton with 19 seats in the House of Commons was able to singled handedly sink a government with over a hundred seats?

Mmhmm. Layton's 19 plus the Liberals' 133 = 152. The Conservatives and the Bloc wouldn't have been able to overcome that with their combined numbers.

&gt;You have a very unusual way of trying to make Layton the cause of everything bad that happened to the Liberals.

Never said anything of the sort.

&gt;Yes, the Liberals weren't corrupt, they did nothing to deserve a non-confidence vote. 

I specifically said the Martin government probably deserved to be defeated. I also said there was no reason for a purportedly 'progressive' party to do so until the programs it claims it cherished were funded so the subsequent administration couldn't undo them.

&gt;Keep telling yourself that.

No need to be hostile.&gt;A person with Danny Williams insight could have focused the article on what only a former premier could know, and compare Harper to former PMs in that respect.

I've heard him speak briefly on the subject. He didn't have much to say about Chretien but he found Martin 'honourable' and was 'able to work with him'. I suspect his favourable opinion came about because Martin agreed to the Atlantic Accord.

He contrasted that with Harper, who he claimed was more focused on his own ideology rather than what was 'best for the provinces' - driven, I'm sure, by Harper's efforts to neutralize that same accord.
&gt;You totally missed the point that I was making.



&gt;How is Layton (with just 19 seats) the guy responsible for the Liberals losing a confidence motion that all of the opposition voted against but Duceppe and Harper, who had many times more seats, aren't responsible?

Never said they weren't. Just that Layton turned his back on deals he claimed he supported.


&gt;I always have a chuckle whenever I hear Liberal partisans try to weave a narrative wherein Layton is responsible for their demise (Duceppe and Harper are apparently either not human beings who voted against the Liberals or don't have human agency or something).  

I have no idea where you get the notion that I'm a 'Liberal partisan'. I'm not - I have no loyalty to any party and I'll thank you not to make such assumptions.

I have backed all of my corrections to your interpretation of history with citations.

&gt;I find it especially amazing that Liberal partisans who try to twist this story never seem to be able to admit that Liberal corruption might be to blame for the Liberals' demise.

For the *third time:* Martin probably deserved to be defeated.

Please read my posts before formulating a response.&gt;Layton promised to support the Liberals even when the full depth of their corruption was revealed?

Considering the 'full depth of their corruption' wasn't revealed until February 1, 2006 (after the election that brought Harper to power), by your own standard Layton participated in prematurely bringing down the Martin government.

&gt;Do you have a citation for that?

If you read what you quoted, I said Layton said he supported the *deals*, as in child care and Kelowna.

As for those, his [voting record] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Jack-Layton%28554%29/Votes?sessionId=141&amp;page=9) speaks for itself:

- 3rd reading and adoption of Bill C-292, An Act to implement the Kelowna Accord - Member Voted Yea
- During the French language debate Layton [claimed credit] (https://books.google.ca/books?id=ApnzhHz-N3oC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=jack+layton+paul+martin+child+care&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5xeCuVNFPd&amp;sig=2Vm84-PdY-qL5MJxfRjAtbmJb6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jack%20layton%20paul%20martin%20child%20care&amp;f=False) for pushing Martin to implement his child care deal, even though Martin campaigned on it in 2004.I will spell it out one last time:

- There was already going to be an election 30 days after the full Gomery report came out.
- There was no reason to have an election in January of 2006 instead of November 2006.
- In playing along with it, Layton betrayed his ideals and deals he helped broker for naked partisan gain. Had he waited a measly couple of months both child care and Kelowna would have been funded and untouchable by Harper.
- The Liberals earned their fate. Layton showed that the NDP are no saints either.

I have yet to hear a rational retort to this.You can keep repeating the 'corruption' mantra as much as you like. The practical effect of Layton's actions were that we lost national day care, Kelowna, and Kyoto. You seem to not want to acknowledge this irrefutable historical fact. You also wildly overinflate the scale of the sponsorship scandal - it would barely make headlines south of the border.

Layton spun good rhetoric and was a generally good politician but he does not deserve the lionization of his legacy that he's been given. The NDP are not saints.Since you no longer seem remotely interested in actually answering any of my points - not that you tackled many throughout the entirety of this thread, preferring redirection and repeating your talking points - this is the end of this conversation."The Kelowna Accord was a cynical insult."

Jack Layton had a hand in crafting it, supported it, and the NDP voted for it every time it came up.

Of course, Layton also killed it (along with national day care and $5 billion towards Kyoto implementation) as soon as he smelled an opportunity to win a few more seats.
I guess you could call that a veiled insult.If he saw this coming and it was his idea to [promise balanced budgets] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tom-mulcair-says-ndp-s-balanced-budget-commitment-was-his-idea-1.3266310) then I have a hard time seeing Mulcair staying in the leadership role if he loses a significant number of seats. Those were the 1-2 punch that have the NDP still trying to pick itself up off the mat.Yes, we were. But if Layton had waited those few months then national day care and Kelowna would have been fully funded and Harper would not have been able to cancel them despite his ideological opposition, just like he could not cancel the Health Accords until they expired in 2014.

It's not a 'meme', it's parliamentary history."There are great people running for every party."

That was extremely refreshing to hear. If he wins, I sure hope the confrontational rhetoric gets toned down from what we're used to.I'm in Halifax West where the Liberal incumbent isn't facing a real challenge. He's done a decent enough job as MP. The NDP's candidate put in a decent performance at the riding debate but hasn't really impressed me. I am not inclined to vote Conservative.

There's not enough difference between the national Liberal and NDP platforms to override my opinion on who would be the best local representative so I am leaning towards voting Liberal. I will wait till the 19th to cast my ballot, though, just in case anything comes along to change my mind.Blair says both the Conservatives and NDP [courted him] (http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/23/bill-blair_n_7648330.html). To quote:

&gt;\u201cJack [Layton] and I were neighbourhood guys,\u201d Blair said, and Regent Park was a neighbourhood that was beset with difficulties.
&gt;
&gt;\u201cThere was a lot of low-income [issues], a lot of poverty. A lot of violence was taking place, mental health issues, the homelessness issues, poor housing, lack of affordable and supportive housing for those who really needed it, and I was responsible for policing and the safety of that community and Jack was its elected representative. ... We were partners.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;But Blair and Layton did not share the same ideology, he said. His personal politics were more aligned with the Grits \u2014 \u201cif I have personal politics.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;\u201cI tried to show not any of that while I was a police chief,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to work really closely with everybody.\u201d
&gt;
&gt;Blair also suggested that he rejected advances by the Tories because he disagreed with their position on law and order. 

There's more of his offered rationale in the linked interview. Whether there's more to it than that is up to the reader to decide.Two months ago I would have thought anyone saying Fillmore had a chance would be a delusional optimist. Now I'm floored at how close the contest is. I'm obviously not as clever as I thought, so I wouldn't dream of guessing how this one's going to turn out.

Megan Leslie's been a fine MP. Fillmore is intelligent and well-qualified. On the plus side, whichever one of them wins seems like they will do a good job for the riding.That would bolster the case for Topp if it were to happen. If the NDP suffered a seat loss significant enough for Mulcair to leave he would be seen as 'untainted' by it.
&gt;This works against the Liberals too: Why did the liberals refuse to cooperate with Layton?

Given how much input Layton had into the budget I'd say they worked with him more than any governing party has with an opposition party in Canadian history. Could they have done more? Maybe. Doesn't excuse what Layton did.Is there anything like QP on the international stage that leaders participate in?It seems unlikely that this behaviour will impact her chances on election day, unfortunately. The riding's never been held by anyone but Conservative / Alliance / Reform and she pulled in ~76% in the past 2 elections.'Chop' how? Do you have a rational critique to offer?I'm not defending anyone, I'm just asking the rationale behind your original post. I haven't seen any commentary about stealthy tax hikes that would impact the middle class to the tune of double his proposed tax cuts.Looks like it happened [around here] (https://www.google.com/maps/@44.769777,-63.5801237,3a,75y,251.73h,75.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srHUO4QsUafwbFs4Ap4lfDQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1). They're lucky they weren't killed.Okay, let's have a look at them right from the [Conservatives website] (http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/our-new-tax-breaks-explained/), courtesy of recently-in-the-news MP Candice Bergen:

- Doubling the Child Fitness Tax Credit from $500 to $1,000. Is this an actual tax cut for families? Beats me. The Auditor General has no idea either, since a report on it was [kept hidden] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/auditor-general-report-child-fitness-tax-credit-report-kept-hidden-1.3051897). Insufficient evidence to call this a material benefit.
- Increasing the monthly UCCB to $60/child for children over 6 and to $160/child for children under 6, and increase the child tax deduction. Trudeau says he's implementing a means-tested tax benefit that will be more generous than that to the middle class. Will it be? Maybe, maybe not. Call it 'close enough' to cancel out.
- Income splitting, according to the PBO, benefits [high- and middle-high income households] (http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/federal-governments-income-splitting-plan-will-benefit-15-per-cent-of-households-higher-income-earners-pbo). Of course, 'middle class' is ill-defined, but it seems the majority won't be able to participate in this one.

Will Trudeau's plan be more generous than Harper's promises? Beats me. Too many moving parts. I can't see any evidence that they will be massively worse off, though. If you do, feel free to provide it.My point was more that the Auditor General does not know if it is working effectively or not and has called for a comprehensive review of all tax credits. It seems Ottawa is happy to announce tax credits but doesn't have the slightest idea if they're actually working as intended.AH (and RT in general) ham up generally nonexistent interpersonal conflicts for comedy. If there were any real serious tension between them they probably wouldn't work so well together.The Sherbrooke Declaration and 'Asymmetrical Federalism' will always be the source of massive disagreement between the NDP and Liberals. Mulcair's been pushing these pretty hard, perhaps to the point where it makes him irreconcilable to Trudeau's vision for the country.- Deduct from that very slightly higher health care costs. There will be a marginal uptick in marijuana use, and associated small costs with a rise in correlated health issues and addictions - which are still very mild compared to alcohol and tobacco.
- The add the savings from using legalized cannabis in place of far more expensive alternative treatments for some select ailments.
- Deduct the cost of a new licensing, inspection, and quality-control bureaucracy.
- Then add to that the savings from no longer enforcing current marijuana laws. In 2002 this was estimated at [$500 million] (http://www.med.uottawa.ca/sim/data/Marijuana_e.htm). Some laws will still be enforced (large unlicensed grow-ops, anything linked to organized crime, etc.) so we don't get the full savings, but we will get a huge chunk of it.

So yeah, on balance, marijuana legalization makes overwhelming sense.Drove past an nearly full parking lot at the school it was being held at on Monday. Decided to wait until election day to cast my ballot.I have my problems with list member MPs but the author is overselling things. Germany and New Zealand, the most comparable countries to Canada out of those that use MMP, haven't collapsed into a morass of undemocratic hyper-partisanship.Read them [for yourself] (https://www.liberal.ca/wayne-easter-on-our-amendments-to-c-51/) and decide. Alternatively, read the [full text of their proposed amendments] (https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/03/C-51.pdf) if you don't want any political spin on the summary.I don't think the assertion that Angela Merkel has managed to craft a decisive government not constrained by partisanship or beholden to 'fringe' parties really needs much in the way of support, does it? There's a wealth of evidence on issue after issue that the German government is capable of strong leadership in spite of the CDU only holding 40% of the Bundestag.

In New Zealand John Key has managed to capture 60 of 121 seats in the unicameral House of Representatives, minimizing the need for compromise. During the whole MMP era the 2 major political parties (National and Labour) have come close to capturing majorities in every election, but not quite crossing the threshold. Every government since MMP was introduced has lasted 3 years, no change from the duration of government in previous 40 years prior to MMP being introduced in 1996.That's a huge snip spanning two countries - and two sides of the planet.

&gt;Strength and stability are not equivalent to representativeness, accountability, and responsibility -- which is clearly what Canadians want.

- Proportional representation is by its very nature more representative. A party taking 40% of the vote gets closer to 40% of the seats under PR than FPTP. Under FPTP that could range anywhere from 30%-60% of the seats, depending on the geographic distribution of support that support. PR is more representative of the wishes of the totality of Canadians.
- PR is more accountable, for the reasons above. If a party drops 20 points in popular support, under FPTP they can limit the damage by shoring up 'safe' ridings and trying to split the vote in others. Under PR, they see a proportionate drop in their seat count - they are more accountable to the voters for whatever caused such a decline.
- 'Responsibility' is a vague concept that can mean very different things to different people. It's difficult to imagine an electoral system that could resolve this, but the increased accountability under PR would seem to be a positive step.

Yes. Italian coalitions colluded to distort their list memberships in 2001. This isn't a fatal flaw with MMP, however, as these sorts of tactics can be prohibited.Sort of, but it's a little more than that. They bash on each other all the time, after all. With Jeremy, it stands out and is perhaps a bit more noticeable for two reasons:

- It's fresh material. We've heard them rag on Geoff for playing poorly, Ryan for constantly flubbing up words, etc., for a long time now. With a new(ish) person it's a whole new avenue of comedic insults.
- By 'bashing' him they're also focusing attention on him. That's absolutely crucial in introducing someone (relatively) new to the audience.

That's my two cents anyway.It was a complicated manipulation of 'list members' to benefit the main vote. They set up phony ('decoy') lists so their main candidates wouldn't suffer any vote losses to list candidates - list candidates made up only 25% of the seats, after all. Both main parties did this, so it wildly benefited a 3 party (Forza Italia) to such an extreme degree that they did not have enough candidates for all the seats they won - though they still wound up being a very minor party overall.

There's more details on the Italian Wikipedia. The [translation isn't great] (https://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_civetta&amp;prev=search) but you get the gist of it.&gt;Probably whether I about the UN drug treaties. 

In the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, cannabis was categorized as Schedule IV drug, the most dangerous classification available. The requirements for this classification are that the drug is "particularly liable to abuse and to produce ill effects" and that "liability is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages".

To quote the [2002 Canadian Senate report] (http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/371/ille/rep/repfinalvol3-e.htm), "At the U.S.\u2019s insistence, cannabis was placed under the heaviest control regime in the Convention, Schedule IV. This regime included drugs such as heroin (the WHO considered any medical use of heroin to be \u201cobsolete\u201d). The argument for placing cannabis in this category was that it was widely abused. The WHO later found that cannabis could have medical applications after all, but the structure was already in place and no international action has since been taken to correct this anomaly."

Marijuana does not belong in this treaty by its own definitions under the heavy control scheme it is listed. Cannabis must be rescheduled - no government should be held accountable to adhering to the spirit of this agreement instead of the (contradictory) letter of it.Not much of a surprise. With their slide in the polls the NDP have to shore up the seats they have. Chisholm will have a hard time holding his seat and it seems Megan Leslie could also use a bump from the leader visiting the region.As far as I can tell it's not illegal. Elections Canada [wants to make it so] (http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rep/off/r40&amp;document=part1&amp;lang=e), but it doesn't seem that any such language is currently in the [Act] (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-2.01/FullText.html).I wonder why the landing gear is painted green. It's an interesting colour choice.No, Tom, no one 'deserves' a shot at governing. You have to earn it. We'll find out if you did on October 19th.

&gt;"Remember Stephane Dion? Remember Michael Ignatieff? So much road kill before Mr. Harper's machine,"

Your own [atrocious attack ads] (https://youtu.be/DyANc-dv5EM) sure as hell didn't help the anti-Harper banner you're claiming to champion.&gt;There's the famous Jack Layton quote: 

And here's Jack Layton [starring in a contradiction] (https://youtu.be/DyANc-dv5EM) to those idealistic words.

It's easier to write stuff than it is to live it.&gt;The NDP claims that on or around Sept. 11, William Amos \u2014 who is the Liberal candidate in the nearby riding of Pontiac \u2014 \u201cFalsely advised\u201d Gatineau resident Marie Dumesnil-Renaud \u2014 who is listed as a staffer at Turmel\u2019s constituency office \u2014 that the NDP incumbent \u201cis extremely ill,\u201d a charge adamantly denied by Amos\u2019 campaign spokesman Marcel Chartrand.

So an NDP staffer is the main witness in this complaint? I certainly hope they have more robust evidence than he-said-she-said for such a serious accusation.&gt;Ok? I wasn't arguing that the NDP is a True beacon of integrity and hope, I was just providing evidence to another user's claim that the "hope&gt;fear" has been used extensively in politics before this specific Trudeau ad, as requested by ArthursRock. 

Is it fair to categorize Layton's letter as 'political speech', though? I have my problems with the guy but I wouldn't go so far to classify his farewell missive as a purely political message.

&gt;It's not like the Liberals have never contradicted themselves or broken promises.

No political party is a shining beacon in that regard.I really wonder who she is, and if she legitimately believes these sorts of theatrics are beneficial to democracy. I have no problem respecting her political beliefs if she's an ardent conservative, but these sort of antics are just embarrassing.&gt;How boring is this sub going to be after the election?

Yeah, all we're going to have is the drama of minority governments jockeying for power (bonus drama if the Conservatives win a minority), possible legalization or decriminalization of marijuana, and a complete overhaul of the way we vote.

Totally uneventful.&gt; My question is: How can any rational Canadian with a moral compass look at this and still vote Conservative? 

- They embrace conservative philosophies (fiscal, social, or both) and feel they don't have anywhere else to turn.
- They're generally happy with the way things have gone the past ~10 years.
- They believe the Conservative promises will benefit them more so than the other parties.
- They're religious. The Liberals lost the religious vote when they legalized same sex marriage and voiced support for abortion. The NDP largely never had it. Never mind that the Conservatives did nothing to undo either of those policies, many religious folk still consider them option #1.
- Many non-European immigrants tend to come from countries with more conservative moral values than Canada.
- And, finally, [nobody votes rationally] (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-psychology-of-voting-why-youre-not-as-rational-as-you-think/article26755921/).

Reasonable people can vote Conservative, even though I see them as an unreasonable party with an unreasonable leader.&gt;Look, I know a lot of this sounds extremely general, and that's because it is. I can only share a limited amount of research. 

You haven't shared any research, just your own opinion. You say you've spent 'months working with research teams' but you've provided no backup to those opinions whatsoever.

&gt;But if nothing else I hope this will make people look **fuehrer** into each party's platform.

That's a hell of a typo.&gt;Why isn't there a party that is socially liberal and fiscally conservative?

They all claim to be 'fiscally conservative'. None of them are. The Conservatives lower taxes but increase spending. The Liberals are generally flat on taxes (with cosmetic increases and decreases) and increase spending. The NDP have no track record, but aren't much different in the promise department than the Liberals this time around.

Both the NDP and Liberals claim to be socially liberal to various degrees. The Conservatives claim not to be, but we still have same sex marriage and abortion after 10 years of their rule, 4 of them as a majority. On any international scale that's pretty 'liberal'.

If a new party came along that makes the same claims of being 'socially liberal and fiscally conservative' the Liberals and NDP will say 'so are we!', no matter how dubious that claim would be. They'd get no vote share as they're competing for the same audience. It's not a winning strategy at the moment.&gt; I don't think we should be comparing Canada internationally if same sex marriage and abortion rights are considered liberal.

[Don't be so sure of that] (https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/06/gay-marriage.jpg&amp;w=1484).

Look at the United States. Huge rifts on same-sex marriage requiring court intervention. Republicans agitating to defund Planned Parenthood.

Look at Canada 15-20 years ago. Abortion massively controversial. No hint that same sex marriage would ever be tolerated.&gt;The liberals did not lose the religious vote. Maybe the ones you know, but the majority I know consider social justice more important than marriage and abortion, and are split between NDP and Liberals

I'm relying on overall statistics, not just people I know.

In 2011 "The NDP drew one out of four of those Canadians who are most religiously devout, while the Liberals attracted 18 per cent." - [Vancouver Sun] (http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/05/09/poll-how-religion-and-ethnicity-shaped-canadas-2011-election/)I wholeheartedly approve. Resistance against incompetent, destructive figureheads is definitely a message that needs to be widely heard in Venezuela.I don't have any animosity towards the NDP (and indeed wouldn't mind it if they had wound up staying ahead) but part of me kind of wants Pat Martin to lose his seat. He's never given me anything but a negative impression as a confrontational hyperpartisan. That, and Liberal candidate Dr. Oulette's [AMA] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/3m4ntg/ama_with_robertfalcon_ouellette/) was pretty interesting, and I appreciated the time he took to write detailed, intelligent responses.We're building slightly watered-down versions of them called the [Harry DeWolf-class] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_DeWolf-class_offshore_patrol_vessel). First steel was cut September 1. The Canadian versions will be 140 tonnes heavier, have conventional propellers instead of azipods (meaning it cannot perform stern icebreaking as the Svalbard can), and is armed with 1x25mm Typhoon Mk38 Mod 2 deck gun vs. the Svalbard's 57mm BOFORS. It's slightly less powerful (2 conventional prop shafts at 4.5MW vs. the Svalbard's 2x5MW azipods) and requires more crew (65 vs. 50 on the Svalbard). The Canadian design can carry a bit more cargo and a larger helicopter, but the Svalbard can carry 2 smaller ones.Interestingly AnyoneButHarper.net has it at a 59% chance of [going Liberal] (http://anyonebutharper.net/riding.php?riding_number=24054). I don't know if I believe that; I personally don't think it's that likely.I don't think a couple of questionable predictions is solid evidence the concept doesn't work. I'd need something with a little more academic vigour behind it to be so certain.&gt;It's not the questionable predictions - it's that people who want to vote strategically can only have imperfect information with which to do so.

Quite True, but then I would argue that's the case for any voter who is not a lifelong adherent to any political party - regardless of their intent on a national scale.Yeah, their prediction is based off of running the model 1,000 times. Running it just once can give some [interesting results] (http://i.imgur.com/PtrC9KA.png).For sure. Monday night sure will be interesting.Yeah, that's why I separated it into its own sentence. Apologies if that was unclear.&gt; If the NDP somehow pulls out a leading majority I guess we can all assume the pollsters have an agenda, or are just incompetent. If the pollsters are right then I guess these supporters are wearing rose colored glasses themselves.

Given that pollsters use election polling to prove their mettle and drum up business from the private sector, distorting polls by virtue of having an 'agenda' would be suicide for their reputation cost them all serious business.

These are mostly the same firms that [predicted the NDP's win in Alberta] (http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/alberta.html) - I can't see how they'd suddenly turn around and hate the federal wing to their own detriment.

Is it possible they're all wrong? Sure, if unlikely. I wouldn't buy for a second that they're expressing an 'agenda', though.Geoff Regan won Halifax West with a decent 7-point margin in 2011 for the Liberals. I foresee him winning re-election by an even wider margin this time around. The NDP challenger doesn't seem inspiring and I expect the Conservative vote has degraded significantly. The Liberals are surging in Atlantic Canada and I expect my riding will ride the wave.Forget the national debt - the biggest debt the federal government has is the debt of trust with First Nations. Some of the FN bills the Conservatives proposed were fairly intelligent (like the education bill) but died because of a lack of trust. Major infrastructure projects face huge hurdles because of a lack of trust.

How do you solve that? You fix things. You fix things and you don't ask for anything in return.

- Poor water quality on a reserve? Fix it. It doesn't matter that this FN didn't file its financial statements.
- Dilapidated, overcrowded housing? Fix it. It doesn't matter that it's dubious if housing is actually a federal responsibility.
- Poor access to health care? Fix it. It doesn't matter that this FN has a chief who made $350K last year.

You go into FN with an attitude of 'how can we help?' You don't worry about whose 'fault' or responsibility stuff is. You keep fixing problem after problem after problem and don't ask for anything in return. It's not cheap and it's not quick, but that's the only way to build trust. Only after a long, arduous process can the federal government begin to approach FN about implementing necessary educational, financial, and in some cases democratic reforms - collaboratively, without imposing anything or blaming anyone.

Anything less is just repeating the same endless cycle of mistrust, leading to wasting everyone's time and money.Endorsements aren't made by journalists, or at least not in a journalistic capacity. They're made by owners or editors, and published as editorials. They're endorsements of the editorial board or ownership, not 'the paper', no matter what they claim. This has been going on [as long as there have been newspapers] (http://torontoist.com/2015/03/historicist-sir-john-a-macdonalds-last-hurrah/).

Of course there's a solution to such behaviour if you find it abhorrent - stop buying papers you feel are engaged in questionable practices. If enough people agree it will stop soon enough.The defense aerospace industry in Canada is dead. We can't even build a mid-sized passenger jet without going into contortions.

&gt;1) a sovereignty interceptor/air superiority fighter

&gt;2) multirole/close air support 

Interceptors are a dead concept. Air superiority fighters are useless to a country like Canada. We have such a small air force that to have any kind of ground attack at all we have to go all multi-role.

&gt;3) refueling tanker

We already have a [pretty modern one] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_CC-150_Polaris)

&gt;4) maritime patrol &amp; command

This is something we could maybe do, but why bother when there's so many off-the-shelf models available for way cheaper?

&gt;5) cargo

Why bother? We have a whole fleet of brand-new excellent [Globemasters] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III)~~I get the feeling that this was recorded before the election. Still a valid message, though.~~[Source link] (http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/tc/2015/55494r-eng.php) for the curious.You're right, I'm dumb as a rock. Missed that part about the majority.&gt;a third of the point of building them is to get good at building them, so that our aerospace industry can thrive.

Why? No one is going to buy a Canadian fighter. We aren't going to be replacing ours again for another 30 years. There's no industry to revive - it would just die in the interim.

&gt;another third is to have them, designed to our needs.

There's nothing special about our needs that existing aircraft cannot do.

&gt;the final third is economic benefit of paying ourselves to build them, instead of paying somebody else.

We'd wind up with an inefficient process that would cost us way more and likely produce an inferior product.

If we want to build it ourselves, buy a production license and manufacture it here. That's what SAAB was offering when they tried to sell us the Gripen.

&gt;would strongly disagree that an interceptor is a dead concept.

The only interceptor left in the entire world are a few dozen aging MiG-25s. They aren't being replaced. Interceptors do one thing only - they fly in a straight line really fast and attack defenseless bombers. They can't defend themselves, they can't dogfight, they can't attack any targets on the ground.

The ICBM rendered the Interceptor useless.

&gt;multirole fighters that are supposed to be actually good (rather than passable) at more than one major role, are a bad idea. they are more expensive to design/build/maintain and are frequently not as good as necessary at some or all of their roles. IE, a pure X is going to beat an XY hybrid head to head.

Every air force in the world is stuffed with multi-role fighters. The US got rid of their F-14s and now flies the F-18 off of its carriers. The US Air Force evolved its F-15 and F-16 into multirole aircraft. The RAF flies the multirole Eurofighter. So does the Luftwaffe. France flies multirole Mirages and the Rafale. Only major powers like the US and Russia bother having air superiority fighters. We aren't them.

It's just not an idea that makes any sense at all.&gt;He supports Bill C-51, which is our version of the patriot act ..

They did post their amendments to the bill, which would add  oversight and remove its ability to violate Canadian laws.

&gt;except worse because you can lose your citizenship on suspected terrorism. 

That's a different bill, bill C-24, which he has promised to repeal.&gt;"Why? No one is going to buy a Canadian fighter." - baseless claim.

Based in reality. The only Canadian fighter we ever exported was the [CF-100] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-100_Canuck) when we sold 53 to Belgium. That was more than 50 years ago.

&gt;when you can/need to roll out your new aircraft, sell the ones you have to some emerging economic power.

Who? India builds their own. Brazil just bought from SAAB. China builds their own. The list of customers is small, short, and many proven aircraft already compete for it.

&gt;you need to aim to be making aircraft all the time, like other major aircraft manufacturers. it's not easy but it's the business of such business.

With no customers it's not a sensible strategy.

&gt;don't care, want home built aircraft.

That's not an argument.

&gt;baseless. we built superior arrows for a good price once upon a time.

We built obsolete aircraft that lost their reason for existence with the invention of the ICBM. All the Arrow could ever do was fly fast in a straight line and shoot a paltry amount of unreliable missiles.

&gt;plausible, but would rather develop from scratch and sell somebody else a production license.

Emotional reasons must not override the logic of staying out of this industry. If a private company wants to pounce on an opportunity, fine, but keep taxpayer dollars out of it.

&gt;Mig25/31 - still flying because the concept is so solid.

It's flying - in very limited service - because Russia hasn't gotten around to building a replacement yet. Russia has no plans to build any more interceptors. Ever.

&gt;when was the last major conflict that was settled with ICBMs? none.

The only powers in the world with long-range bombers and air superiority fighters have ICBMs. We're never going to war with one of them so we have no need for air superiority fighters or interceptors.

&gt; I'm suggesting an interceptor like the f-15. air superiority interceptor, not just a rocket with a guy on it.

That's not an interceptor, then.

&gt;we don't need to threaten ground targets with that aircraft.

We aren't big enough to buy and maintain an air superiority fighter and a ground attack aircraft.

&gt;that doesn't make them a good idea.

It makes them the absolute only feasible idea for a non-superpower, unless you want to add a few tens of billions to the defense budget.

&gt;watch this expert talk about why the multirole f-35 is a lemon because it is not a pure dogfighter

Canada has zero need for a 'pure dogfighter'. The number of air-to-air engagements Canada has been involved in during the pas 50 years has been zero.
&gt;if you would rather sit back and write cheques than be a country that can actually develop something, then that is one way to do it.,  

When they can develop a better, cheaper product than we could, yeah, I would. Building a modern military aircraft is really, really, really hard and expensive. Many other countries have companies that have already done all the hard work. Yes, we're helping them profit, but it's also the only economical choice for Canada.

&gt;but if you don't put together a vision of some kind for technological advancement and industry, then soon you will not be able to write those cheques.  

That's an isolationist anti-trade argument. The closest country in the world to adopt such a philosophy is North Korea's 'Juche' ideology. It isn't exactly working out for them.

&gt;it's easy to sit back with no vision and say nothing will work out.  not very inspiring.  I don't imagine anyone agreeing with you positions would ever build a space program or an internet or bring electricity and plumbing to every home, etc...

No one country built the International Space Station. No one country developed every technology that brought us the modern Internet. International trade is not evil.Their stance on C-51 was almost their undoing early in the campaign. It does not surprise me that they want to deal with it as soon as possible, while they're still in their 'honeymoon' period.

Oversight is something I can get behind but I will have to have more detail before deciding if I support the whole thing.&gt;Air strikes against ISIS, in principle, was the one thing everybody at the table could agree with. Assad, America, the Rebels, Iraq, Turkey, the Iranians, the Israelis, Hezbollah, the Kurds, the Russians &amp; the Europeans. 

Right.

There are about [62 members of the anti-ISIS coalition] (http://news.nationalpost.com/news/mobilizing-the-world-up-to-62-nations-and-groups-have-joined-coalition-against-isis). Of those how many are engaged in actual air strikes? About a dozen.

All Trudeau is doing is moving us from the 'air strikes' column to the 'humanitarian and military aid' column. We're not 'pulling out of the fight', we're changing our contribution.

Canada's six aircraft are not going to be the difference between victory and defeat. Everyone needs to tone down the rhetoric a little, including the [heavily-biased author] (http://www.torontosun.com/2015/09/14/the-moral-need-for-conservatism) of the original article.&gt;Not to detract from the column change arguement, but six aircraft do an insane amount of damage.

Sure. Canada's aircraft have reportedly done [over 1,000 sorties] (http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=985749) as of the middle of the year, with ~10% of those resulting in resulting in a strike.

All I'm saying is that Canada's change in mission can be easily made up by other partners engaging in air strikes.

Our aircraft are quite old and are vulnerable to the small amount of advanced anti-aircraft weaponry ISIS is reportedly [gotten their hands on] (http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/10/28/ISIS-fighters-seen-with-sophisticated-antiaircraft-missiles-.html). The downing of a Canadian fighter would do far more damage to the coalitions efforts than this withdrawal.&gt;Source?

"Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt called the medical isotopes crisis a "sexy" problem and wanted credit for fixing it, according to an audio recording made public by the Halifax Chronicle-Herald after a court battle to suppress its contents."The Canadian Election was held on Monday, October 19th. This election resulted in the Liberal Party of Canada winning a majority government victory, ousting the Conservative Party of Canada, who had been in power since 2006.

The reason that this is all over Reddit is largely because of the personal charisma of the Liberal leader and new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He is (relatively) young, very photogenic, and delivers a [positive message] (http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/sunny-ways-my-friends-sunny-ways-lessons-of-wilfrid-laurier-not-lost-on-trudeau-115-years-later) of cooperation. He also enjoys things that connect very well with the Reddit demographic: He's a self-confessed [comic book and Star Wars nerd] (https://graphicpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/trudeau-montreal-comic-con.jpg?w=860) - even going so far as to post a picture of himself in a DeLorean [yesterday] (http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/21/justin-trudeau-back-to-the-future_n_8352176.html).

Another corollary reason is that his style is a complete change from his predecessor, Conservative Stephen Harper. Harper is seen as cold, unapproachable, and surrounded himself with people who gave the image of being more obsessed with [message over substance] (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AJsvaDpFCl8gJ%3Awww.nationalnewswatch.com%2F2015%2F10%2F21%2Fharper-learns-the-folly-of-surrounding-himself-with-obsequious-operatives%2F+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca#.Vij_Kyt9YUP). His campaign was one of attack ads, negativity, and exploiting fear of [Islam] (http://www.vox.com/2015/10/20/9570301/stephen-harper-niqab-canada) while offering no real vision for how he would improve things. He'd run negative campaigns before but this one was a whole new level.

Finally Trudeau's policies are generally those that Reddit's demographics more-or-less endorse. He wants to reform security laws to include more oversight of spy agencies, legalize marijuana 'right away', and get rid of the First-Past-The-Post voting system. Whether he pulls any of this off remains to be seen but for now he's enjoying a major honeymoon.&gt;Aircraft or helicopters? Because those aren't advanced at all in opposition to fighter jets. Their maximum height is 3.8 km. That's just no problem for a fighter jet. Fly above that max. height, target adversaries walking around with those manpads, bomb, move on.

It depends on the availability of target designators in the area - largely a reason why CF-18s have been hanging around Kurd areas given Canada has personnel among the Kurds to spot targets. Operating in an area without such designators can require flying fairly low.

&gt;Also, if your general argument is that it's dangerous to conduct war, then.. yeah, uhm... duh.

A small portion of my argument is the older hardware Canada operates puts its pilots at a higher degree of risk as compared to other actively bombing coalition partners (with the possible exception of Jordan and the Netherlands whose aircraft are 'escorted' by USAF aircraft).&gt;Again?? Does anyone remember the Avro Arrow?

A beautiful aircraft. A beautiful aircraft rendered obsolete by the death of the interceptor concept upon development of the ICBM. A beautiful aircraft that could only fire a paltry number of unreliable missiles against helpless bombers and in no way could defend itself from anything remotely capable of air-to-air combat.Canada doesn't need a dogfighter. We haven't had a single air-to-air engagement in over 50 years. We need a competent multi-role aircraft. The F-35 may or may not be the best choice but the previous government's refusal to hold an open competition to decide made it a very easy target for political gain.&gt;I don't believe this is entirely factually correct.

Maybe, but that's not going to be something that the (newly-elected) government can fix in the next 12 months.

&gt;The problem I see with this is that Canada clearly has the ability, much more so than most countries in the coalition yet they feel it acceptable to pass a job off they can easily and safely fulfill to smaller less able nations.

That's an unfair criticism of the 55+ nations in the anti-ISIS coalition who are not participating in the bombing campaign. Sovereign nations have the right to decide their own priorities and Canada's voters have given a strong endorsement to the platform of the new government which includes this measure.

Could Canada's course of action ultimately prove to be wrong? Sure, but that's their decision to make.&gt;It was only obsolete if the technology we had replaced it with lived up to the hype, which it didn't. 

Interceptors died off in the 60s as the threat of bomber fleets was replaced with the ICBM and as engine performance increased such that 'regular' fighters could handle the interceptor role.

&gt;The BOMARC missile system was hilariously underdeveloped and completely unusable. 

True.

&gt;The F101 Voodoo wasn't much better, and was really just a stopgap measure when compared to an aircraft that was actually designed for our needs.

The CF-101 was a vastly superior aircraft to the CF-105. It was half as heavy, had twice the combat range, was almost as fast (Mach 1.7 vs Mach 2.0 for the Arrow), and cost $1.8M vs. $4.3M for the Arrow - though it had a lighter missile payload than the Arrow.

&gt;We still have ICBMs today, but that doesn't change the fact we're needing an aircraft (not to get into the F35 debate).

We need multi-role aircraft. Nobody flies interceptors any more except the limited number Russia still operates - and intends to replace.

&gt;Also, the 105 didn't need to defend itself in air to air combat because it was basically a point interceptor. No Soviet fighters would be making it all the way to North Bay. The planned mission profile was extremely short, and entirely defensive.

If Russia wanted to attack North America today they wouldn't be doing it with bombers. If they did any modern fighter could deal with it - we don't need an interceptor.&gt;Yes but of those 55+ nations I can assure you most of them have an air force that is no where close to the ability of Canada's.

Of the nations in the coalition not participating in air strikes Germany, Finland, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden have larger contingents of combat-capable aircraft - in some cases vastly larger.

&gt;Would you say it is morally acceptable for a Country such as Canada who has not had any losses or really had any close calls and has the economy to easily sustain these strikes has essentially decided that smaller nations with lesser ability and smaller economies should handle it.

Yes, just as it's acceptable when larger nations (e.g. Germany, Japan, South Korea) with similar or bigger economies can choose not to participate in the bombing and contribute in other ways.&gt;However of the countries you mention Japan has severe constitutional restrictions on military actions that are not purely defensive

Not any more.

&gt;South Korea historically keeps its military at home for the obvious reason of North Korea, and Germany is taking the large majority of refugees in the west.

Germany taking in refugees does not require the use of its air force. It seems, though, that you agree that a country can pursue a moral course of action that does not involve using its military capabilities. In that sense Canada's new government has also pledged to take in a much higher number of refugees, 25,000 more by year's end.

&gt;Now does that still excuse them completely? No not at all. However it does not make Canada pulling out of direct combat when completely capable okay.

The United States would not accept another country telling it that the choice of its voters is not 'okay'. Canada has no reason to either.&gt; As of what a couple months ago? Do you really think it would politically feasible for Abe to deploy fighters abroad?

We aren't discussing feasibility, we're discussing morality. You accept that it would not be possible for Abe to engage in a bombing mission because the people of Japan will not tolerate it. That's their right as a democracy.

It's Canada's right too."Signs of enemy activity! Going on alert!"&gt;However backing out of the fight against ISIS for no clear reason is not the correct path.

You have it backwards. Going into a fight with no clear plan - and failing to develop one a year in - is not the correct path. Military intervention in this sort of conflict has never worked, especially not safe and sanitary (for the West) bombing without a major ground component. Just look at the mess in Libya.

So long as the US / EU and Russia are at odds over Assad and no one's putting serious pressure on Iraq to resolve its parliamentary chaos ISIS will have fertile ground on which to spread, shrinking the contribution of 6 aircraft further and further into futility.Personally, I hope we don't continue appending the PM's name to the government. I wasn't a fan of the orders to use the 'Harper government' and hope Trudeau tells journalists they aren't obliged to call his administration the 'Trudeau government'.&gt;The purpose of the strikes was extremely clear. ISIS if you remember was spreading like wildfire before these strikes started. They were sweeping over Iraq and Syria faster than anyone could comprehend while steam rolling anyone in their path. These strikes alone have stopped the mass movement of convoys that ISIS used to do as well as disabling most of their weaponry advantage of their opposition which is why now you see ISIS not really gaining as much ground in any areas against US supported rebels/ kurds and actually seeing gains against ISIS in many areas. 

Are you [sure about that] (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/isis-territory-map-us-campaign/404776/)?

ISIS has always had trouble spreading in areas where Sunni populations were not in the majority.

You're going to have to explain why no new interceptors have been developed by anybody since the 60's, then.Neither of which are interceptors.
