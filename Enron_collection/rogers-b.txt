 Rebecca: I was just talking to Fred Mitro and he says you have put together a couple of different models on coal.  Can you please send me those models, so I can get an idea on how you guys are looking at the analysis.  Thanks! Regards, Ben 
 I talked with Don Miller and Mitch Robinson and it seems that they have also covered your other concerns.  They were the ones who I contacted with your concerns regarding your demin water, tax abatement and electricity questions. Ben 
 Gus: Are you able to assistance me in answering #2.  I have already received Dave's comments.  Thanks Ben 
 Amy: Here are the answers to your questions. With regards to the air permit to construct application, Jinsung will send it to you by email today, if he hasn't already; The Petition for Alternate testing, has been sent to you; 3.     This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning committee, the local emergency response department, and the local fire department declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities greater than 500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are being mailed out today. 4.     We are in the process of tracking down the analytical data associated with the Lake Acquisition property and will hopefully have that to you later today.  I hope this helps and please give us a call if you have any more questions. Thanks! Ben 
 John: With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs. These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me know if you have any other comments.  Thanks! Ben 
 Jane: This attachment now has a completed answer for question #4.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks! Ben

 Hey Dan: Just wanted to drop you a line.  I hadn't talked to you in quite some time and wanted to see how everything was going.  I had lunch today with my friend, Andrew Slocum, who I think you know.  He talked to his good friend Adam Wexslur (sp) and said things were going well with the paper.  He told me that everything seemed to be going great and that the paper has been out on print for a little while now.  It sounds great!  Please let me know how everything is going, because I think its awesome what your doing.  Hope to talk to you soon. Ben 
 Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.

Ben 
 Sounds Good! 
 Charlie: It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron. Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing, that would be helpful. With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score. Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign. I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham, it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while. As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions. Regards,  Ben Rogers 
 I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time. Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping. We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love. Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk to you soon. Love Ben 
 Amy: Forgot to mention timing.  I can do nights and weekends, but mainly as much time with them as possible. Thanks Ben 
 Golf sounds like a great idea.  I will talk to meathead - "Brandon" about playing.  By the way, do you have Jason Staebels' address or phone number. Thanks Ben 
 Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more for a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or as late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own, but I wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call! Ben 
 Hey: That sounds good.  How does Thursday work? Ben 
 Amy: I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to help me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions as soon as possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue. Ben (713) 853-7998

 Hey Mike: Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better. Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon. Ben

If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!  Ben Rogers (713) 853-7998 
 I am putting together that right now.  Thanks Ben 
 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed. While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager. Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day. I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues. Regards,  Ben

 Chris: Here is the confidentiality agreement we used to send out to all the bidders.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Ben 
 Don: This is the latest presentation. Ben 
 Pam: The presentation I sen you yesterday needs to be broken up into three different presentations.  You can see that there is a cover page for each presentation.  The first presentation is from page 1 to 18; second presentation is from 19 to 36; and the third presentation is from 37 to 55. Please give me a call idf you have any questions. Thanks Ben 
 Pam: Here is the latest version of the presentation.  Let me know when you are going to download the presentation into the system.  Thanks Ben 
 Dad: The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School. Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class and going to take the GMAT one more time. I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give you the laod down of what I have been thinking. Regards, Ben 
 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there. Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.  Regards, Ben 
 Thanks! 
 I will do that first thing on Thursday.  I will call you with the results. Ben 
 Pam: Per your discussions with Don Miller.  Here are the presentations we used in this afternon's recording.  One is the actual presentation, which will go online.  The other are the sales points that Mike Miller used to go through, which does not go online.  Hope this helps.  Thanks Ben 
 There will be a meeting to discuss the plant visits at 1:00 pm Today!  The room is EB 3125B.  Please let Don Miller know if you won't be able to make it.  Thanks Ben 3-7998 
 Dr. Harris: I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in attending the Business School. I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class (Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I have also decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking. I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score. As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile. Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Regards,  Ben Rogers  Associate (713) 853 -7998 Enron Corp. 
 Dale: I will be sending you the CA's some time this morning.  I needed to wait till we had our conference with the investment bankers, CSFB, to know which companies were going to the second round.  I did not want to send you the CA's of companies that were not going on to the second round.  Please give me a call if you have any questions. Ben 
 Well, I am.  It's like this everynight.  I thought that you guys going back to Bermuda would be fun.  I hope Kara finds a way to battle the problem she has.  I tough for me to imagine what kind of place she's in right now.  Talk to you soon. Ben 
 Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon. Love, Ben 
 This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week. Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a call sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.  Give me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya! Ben 
 Professor Titman: I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in attending the Business School. I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class (Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking and runs through December. I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision. As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent developments. Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon  Regards,  Ben Rogers Enron Corp.  P.S. David Martin says hello!

 Good to hear from you.  Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend. Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the place she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk about this soon. Love, Your Son 
 Sorry to hear that.  I called Patty again to ask her brother if he knew anybody running the marathon.  I also called Megan's sister, Deirdre to see if she knows of anyone not going to run, but signed up.  I hope this helps. It would great for you to be in it, running it. Ben 
 Thanks, C B 
 Cliff: Do you have Dierdre's address in NYC.  Megan and I are staying there next weekend and are getting picked up at the airport and need to tell the driver where were going.  How is everything going?  Slow down the traveling yet? Make sure you include yourself in the Turkey Run on Thanksgiving in Chicago. Talk to you soon. Ben 
 Here is the latest version of the presentation. Ben 
 Omar: Here is the final version of the Pastoria Facility. Ben 
 Dave: Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed interested in the assets.  Hope this helps. Ben 
 Squeeze in some golf or bet on the horns -  I sure we can find some "other" activities to keep you, I mean us, out of trouble. Ben 
 Here is the latest version of the management presentation.  We are contining to update and fill in the holes.  Please give myself or Don a call if you have any questions.  Thanks Ben 
 Guys: Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is a good time for you this afternoon.  Thanks for your time. Ben 3-7998 
 Here you go!  Again, good to hear from you. Ben 
 Michael: Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side. Hope this helps. Ben 
 Here is the our version of the Confidentiality Agreement.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also, I talked to Scott Chambers and he said that he recently talked to you and sent you some information.  Hope it helped. Ben 
 Eric: I got a call from David Martin looking from Jason Staebels phone number.  Do you have it or do you know who does?  Thanks Ben 
 It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon. Ben 
 I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This project is going to kill me.  I glad to see that you are active on the net. I'll keep in touch a little better. Love Ben 
 I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been amortizing it each month as its been paid.  Let me know if you need anything else. Ben 
 Thanks for the info.  We found the org charts. Ben 
 Everyone: Attached is the list of the preliminary Allegheny/Enron transition team members for the 2000 Peaker assets.  If you think you should not be on it or that someone else is better suited for the task then please let me know. Please check over the information to make sure everything is correct.  We are trying to plan for a kick-off meeting with Allegheny within the next couple of weeks.  Thanks for your assistance with this very important project. Regards,  Ben Rogers 3-7998

Please let me know if you do not find them.  Thanks! Ben 
 Scott: Regarding the NOV issues, please refer to DealBench document 02.05.06.02 A, which will have the correspondance letters regarding these issues.  Please give me a call if you have any additional questions. Thanks! Regards, Ben Rogers (713) 853-7998

 Mitch: Here are the questions for Ameren.  I wanted to incorporate your comments before we sent them out today, so if you could comment on some of these questions that would be very helpful.  Thanks Ben 
 Here are the questions for Ameren that we are sending out today.  I wanted to make sure that we incorporated some of your comments before we sent it to them.  If you could please add your comments some time this morning, that would be great.  Thanks Ben

 Luke: How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still fucking hot and Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan and I are actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.  I haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying to set something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you guys, but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.  Hope all is going well and talk to you soon. Ben  (713) 853-7998 Office Ph. 
 Here are the questions for Duke regarding 99's.  Please check over and give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks! Ben 
 Hey Mike: You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think. Ben 
 James or Rishi: Please send out the books for Sempra, PPL Global, and NRG.  We have executed signed CA's with them and are ready t go out.  Thanks Ben

 David: Here are more of the EDR files. Ben 
 Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with a non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thank you! Ben 
 Here it is: Mr & Mrs James Rogers 6 Noel Lane Cincinnati, OH 45243  I'm glad you guys had a good time out there.  It's such a great place to spend a weekend. 
 We are going to have to push back the meeting to review the model if that ok.  I need to finish up some work down here as well as review the model a little more to make sure I am familiar with it. Thanks Ben 
 They will be there for one day this week, but really not till Sunday, when they leave Houston for Cincy. 
 Mr & Mrs James Rogers 6 Noel Lane Cincinnati, OH 45243  Megan and I had a great time with you guys.  We need to figure out about going out there for skiing.  Thats when we can really make fun of them. Weasel! Ben
