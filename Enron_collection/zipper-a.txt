 I will be running the power options desk with UBS. I will still be trading gas though. how about you ? 
 This looks good. what were the system vols and when can you get me the rest ? 
 We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement. 
 same plan 
 cool go for it. 
 close enough for 5 9's, no ? 
 no interest. 
 I know Steve Murray quite well. 
 Add Barrick Gold to your list. They like Enron, and Bruce Garner has had extensive discussions with them. 
 what would be the product the Sabre would list ? I like the name but can't see the business idea; help me out. 
 where are we at with them ? 
 Please work with the group so that I am no longer inundated with erequests for additional mailbox space.

   how does this relate to what we are working on with them ? 
 When will we have a draft available fo distribution to Accenture ? 
 Unfortunately I will not be attending, but I would like to participate via videocon. 
 This is my simplistic first take: 
 Bloomberg has come back to the table with us and are being good boys so far. So I don't have a problem issuing them a EnronOnline journalist ID to view your prices. Thanks for the cooperation.  Andy 
 1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.  2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.  3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.  4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.  5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.  6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.  7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.  8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7). 
 I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.  I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.  A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline. $150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.  I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.  Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.  I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy. 
 Congratulations !  Now let's focus on closing the deal and getting someone else signed up.  Well done all.  AZ 
 huh ? 
 700 NM, 4 hrs total 
 Earthsat requires a password for enron, what is it ? 
 1). Reuters will give us 75% of all subscription revenue, which is how the product is sold. This is on a monthly or yearly basis.  2). Lynne T. Jones ASID phone: 281-437-3307 pager: 713-833-0736  good luck. 
 Let's you and I get together for lunch today, and do the same with Brad tomorrow. 
 I will be participating by videocon. 
  This is where we are with banks for fx product hosting on EOL. 
 please put greg piper, phillipe bibi, and greg whalley on  distribtuion list.  Thanks 
  I have had you added to distribution list. 
 Sounds kind of vague to me. I think we should stick to known publications who we think add value. 
 In case you guys didn't have a copy. 
 done. 
 I can get in but I have no access to gas messageboard. Can you please fix.  Thanks 
 have we heard back ? 
 Jorg,  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...  A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go.  I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.  I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.  Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994  AZ 
 Ras,  This looks fine. Please distribute to Accenture.  Thanks, AZ 
  open up attached word doc. that should cover it. thanks. 
 would you like me to fill it out and return it to you ? 
 sorry for the delay I will have my check tomorrow. 
 John,  We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.  We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.  Revenue expectations:  Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.  thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;  With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.  This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.  If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.  AZ 
 Can I get a Reuters screen as well ? 
 I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.  1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.  2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.  3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.  4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.  If anyone has any questions about this let me know.  AZ 
 Still does not work. 
 please... 
 Next steps are he gets me a contract for the API, and lets me know when they are meeting on mid and back. 
 Let's table this for now. Too much going on.  On another note: Where do we stand with TFS ? 
 Heard you had ended up at Allegheny. In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?  Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.  Hope all is well.  Andy 
 Arvind, The propoer contact at Enron for you is Jay Webb. He can be reached at jay.webb@enron.com. I will foward this to him.  Good Luck, Andy Zipper 
  Over to you. 
 dave forster. 
 I need this deal closed by month end. 
 why are we bothering with LOC, I thought we had moved past that ? 
 Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ? This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ? 
 Please remove me from your contact list. Thank You. 
 Not enough of a background in finance. Thanks and keep trying. 
 Stewart,  It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.  Andy Zipper Enron Networks 
 Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !  On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.  On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.  Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a b
