 I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.  Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.  Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.  I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.  Sincerely,    <Embedded Picture (Metafile)> 
 Rick:  As I am sure you have read by now, Jeff Skilling has chosen to leave Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.  I want to assure you that Jeff's departure will in no way affect the relationship that Enron has with Microsoft and more specifically MSN.  I have been briefed on the MSNIA project, by my team,  and they assure me that we are on track to meet your Broadband Internet Access roll-out plans in early October.  I look forward to getting more personally involved with Microsoft to help insure that our ongoing relationship and partnership continues to mature and flourish.  I will contact you in the near future to discuss with you this transition.  In the meantime,  if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact my office.  Ken 
 Hasan:  I fully understand and agree with your comments.  Unfortunately, I did not see the "Travel Secruity Update" e-mail before it was sent out.  We will do better.  Ken 
 Hi Michelle -  It looks as though this will work quite easily now as the breakfast Ken originally had scheduled will not take place.  I received word from Sue Landwehr that it will be cancelled as it was Republican Governors and they will not now be here.  We'll coordinate an exact time tomorrow.  Thanks.  Rosie 
 Hi Mrs. Jamail -  Ken and Linda Lay would very much like to attend the dinner on September 12.  Will you please send me the details or phone me at 713-853-6773?  Thanks.  Rosalee Fleming Assistant to Ken Lay 
 Dear Pam:  Thank you for your e-mail of August 15th.  It is always a pleasure to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations of Enron leadership.  Part of our continuous improvement involves an on-going review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.  We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere to our core values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.  These values become even more significant as we continue to grow and expand our scope of business, and more critical as we become a more culturally diverse workforce.  We enjoy our status as one of the best places in America to work according to Fortune and other sources thanks in part to our willingness to examine our organization and make needed change.  Our employee surveys, belief in open communication, and exit interview process for employees choosing to leave Enron are examples of our efforts to seek out feedback and scrutinize the way we do business.  Your feedback will help play a role in that process.  Sincerely,  Ken Lay 
 Christie,this may not go to you, but wasn't sure if it should be Misha Siegel.  Will copy Misha also.  This may just not be something we would do anyway.  Rosie

 We did receive this from David. 
 Hi Liz -  I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called "Precious" and "Baby" this morning.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate from him!!  He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop 3321 Ella Blvd. & 34th Street Houston, Texas  77018  Phone:  713-682-1650, fax 713-682-5520  Rosie 
 Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.  Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.  Rosie 
 On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing. MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC represents the frontier of computing technology.  I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.  Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 or please reply by e-mail to me.  Ken Lay

 Hi Donna -  Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past Fathers and let us send the letters?  Let me know.  Rosie 
 As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is planned.  Thanks for everyone's patience.  Rosie 
 Dear Mr. Carmona -  Everything you have is correct.  I don't have an exact arrival time on July 28 at this point.  Rosalee 
 Hello Janice:  I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes.  Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger "Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston.  I hope you have a great summer.

 Hi Jeff and Valerie -  Sorry I hadn't responded sooner.  I was trying to get Mr. Lay out of town. Actually July 12 may work for him.  He is out of the office until June 12, but I'll try to ask him on his messages, so you'll have an answer before then.  Rosalee
