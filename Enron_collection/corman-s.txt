  fyi 
  I'm fine with these latest changes to our OBA mark-up. 
 Chris,  I also wanted to mention that I confirmed the Connie Davis of Travel Brokers received our passports and Kazakstan and Russian visa applications and is holding them pending instructions from you.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 (work) 713-857-2013 (cell) 
 Ginger/Chris,  The Orphans petitions coordinator at the Houston INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.

  Hi Ms. Traylor,  I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.  Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month. Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.  I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.  While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.  Regards,  Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom) scorman@enron.com 
  Do you know?

  Here is my two cents...  From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on our property or destroy the tree.  A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue. Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.  Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down. 
 Please add to my personal contact list 
 Thanks for the invite.  Unfortunately, we have a customer meeting at South Shore Harbor that day.  Hope you are doing well.  I haven't made it home to a football game yet this year -- although I guess that has been a blessing.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
 FYI 
 Kent,  I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.  I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.  Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.  Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it. 
 Thanks.  I got your voice message.  I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style. 
 It has been terrific to correspond with Liz & satisfying to help her get info on Oksana from my correspondence with Larisa.  My dossier is with Ginger, hopefully being translated.  I have not yet received my INS approval and I'm scared that I'll anger them if I start calling. 
 Too much partying yesterday -- so I didn't finish my homework.  I'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the Commission meeting.  So I'll send them to you by 10:30 AM of so.  If you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know. 
 No revenue is better.  I've already been over our O&M with my directors. 
 Thanks for the info 
 I'll be at the meeting Friday.  Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.   Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M? 
 Glad you had fun -- but sorry the Astros didn't do their part!

 Danny,  Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday Brad took Jodie Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).  Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with Mike Bryant and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.  Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.  I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements. 
 Mike - I'll be out at the Ops. conference until 9 AM.  Could you please coordinate the meeting time at the Enron building with Jude/Bill.  Ricki I'm assuming that you have set our travel to ballpark.  Also, I want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while.  Mike - Can we quickly pull together dinner/happy hour plans (casual) downtown after the game (perhaps Ricki could reserve a spot for 10 at the old Irma's over by the ballpark) where Dannis, Steve, Jack, Rachel, schedulers, etc. meet us.  I need to leave downtown by 7 PM for a meeting this evening and I want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements. 
 Please RSVP that I will attend. 
 Jo, Kent & Dave,  Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to:  - Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info. - Add additional interconnect points - Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area - Improve formatting and readability.  Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report.  Please confirm that it meets with your expectations. We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week. 
  I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  Shelley is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and Kim as a couple since that time.  Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents to their six-year old son Chad.  It has been a delight to watch them raise Chad to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.  Sincerely  Christi Nicolay {contact info}   Please call Ava Garcia to pick it up when done.  Thanks -- I'll call you tonight 
  Caroline - Would you be amenable to renaming your weekly report?  There is some confusion that this report is the Gas Logistics report.  Thanks for your help.

  I talked to Ginger this morning.  She received my dossier and is sending it for translation.  She said she will be at Chris Ivins today reviewing dossiers.  She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in Austin.  I asked Ginger to send you the picture of Oksana.  She said that she thought she had already had.  She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later.  Talk to you soon. 
 Sorry but Lynn already gave it away 
 I can't join you in walking this year, but you can put me down for a $50 contribution.  I don't need a shirt though -- I still have JDF shirts from years past.

  Liz,  I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.  Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.  We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.  One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.  Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

 Yes Thank You -  The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today.  I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today. 
 I think we expected it.  The ALJ said he need more time for his decision.  On a positive note, it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement 
      I would propose to use only the Mainline West sheet. 
 Thanks for you voice message.  I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday.  In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.   He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.  I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.  Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter. 
  Please forward this letter & invoice to GulfSouth.  I am sending an email copy to Claire. 
 Please mark on my calendar & print out this file. 
 Suzanne,  Hope you are doing well.  Any update on when Gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy?  I was hoping that I might be in a position to forward to the INS later this week.   I have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on INS approval.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083

 Sounds interesting (although I don't have capital dollars at this point for= modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).   Let me touch base wi= th my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you. 
  Pam,  Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.  On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.  I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group. 
  Gary -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee contact information during Tropical Storm Allison & during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.  When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.  Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-Enron ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the Enron intranet or servers are down? 
 With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:  1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.  2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well.... 
 Please save these files to a diskette for me, make a copy (so I can store o= ne at home) & label the files Customer E-Mail Contact Info. 
  Please store this info for me 
 Mike - I have Stan's staff meeting at 8. 
 Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.  I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the standardization. 
 Sure -- Let me first make a run at the business needs and then prior to the= general notice email, I'll take care of charitable requests.  Good idea. =20 
  Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.    My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions - where storage allocation notices appear - why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.  Fixes already put in place In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:  - Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls - Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings - Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime - We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages - Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators - Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ} 
  I'm fine with the filing

 Yes, I'm taking off tomorrow.  Wish you could too.  I'm planning on taking Chad to the Zoo. 
 Hi,  Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.  Two other items when you get a chance: -Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date. -Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.  Shelley 
 Hi Cyndi,  Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound?  Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow. 
 Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs.  They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.  Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case. RE: G-33. DOCKET# GX01-1 000 Discussion of Gas Pipeline Operational Flow Orders

 Suzanne,  Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.  I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.  Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?  I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow. 
 Thanks for the update. 
  This order is even better.  It says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake.  http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/GAS/TM/TM996-29.00C.TXT

  A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint  1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).  3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case. 
 Catherine,  Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.  This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.

 I'm flexible on the departure time 
 Letter looks good.  Just a few thoughts:  - In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done? - Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?  Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter? 
   Here are my additional suggestions 
 Toby,  Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't each outage posting be its own document? 
  Toby,  Can you please provide me with a complete set of all the postings & extentions related to the outage to remove the MOPS 831 platform (starting around Aug 24 and continued several times). 
 Andy - I may join by phone, depending on logistics this afternoon.  I'll let you know. 
   Jackie,  Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:  Children's Church Update  A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.  The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!   Thanks Shelley 713-853-7083  P.S.  Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance. 
 Thanks looks good.  I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details! 
  FYI  While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates. For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

 These both track with the last drafts that I saw and commented on. 
  When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.  In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. "Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board, consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. "  Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of? 
  Here is what I started working on yesterday -- it isn't very far along. 
 Ricki -- I think it's working. 
 Sarah,  Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  For example, for calendar year 1997: Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.   Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.  Call me at x37083 if you have questions. 
  FYI 
 Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics   In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.   I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.   I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.  As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled. 
  Joceyln,  I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.  Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.  Thanks

  Hi Ginger & Chris,  Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.  When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email. I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?  I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.  Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
  Can you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.  It looks like it left my account.  Also can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?  It doesn't look like its in the account either. 
 Rod,  Do you know how to get in touch with Paul Cherry or Dan Fancler over the weekend? I have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.  I need to have someone run a payables list.  I can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103

  FYI - This is what the supply breakdown looks like for FPL without ENA in the equation 
  Just got off the phone with Jennie and I know you already talked to her.  My direct flight tomorrow cleared so I plan on taking it.  I will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th & then we can spend some of our waiting time together. 
  It's been a few days now since ENA dropped their gas supply from ENA from 250M down to approx 75-85M and FPL has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ENA gas and still keeping its nominations at 800M.  Here is a quick snapshot of where FPL is sourcing there gas from:  ENA					85 Exxon					35 SNG					48 Destin				92 Western Gas 			30 Dynegy				40 Oneok					25 BP Amoco				153 El Paso				96 Aquila				20 Duke					26 Coral					20 Cinergy				20 Sempra				25 Bridgeline				15 National Energy			15  Delivered Gas: FGU					15 Reliant				31 Energy Authority			7 NUI					30 Total FPL Supply			828 Less: FPL Energy Services		21 Total FPL Deliveries		807  (774 Firm + 33) 
  Good morning all.  Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me? 
  Revised presentation for the meeting this afternoon 
 Gary,  Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control. 
 FYI 
 Please verify that this is taken care of and that I do not need to have someone in my group work on this.  Thanks. 
  Need to talk to you about this 
  I'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $181.17 deduct from my 12/31 paycheck. 
 FYI 
 Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities - They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so. - They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.  We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard will be checking everyones card prior to entry.  We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.  We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation Center (EB42C1).  2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone  We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS.  On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured for approximately two weeks, depending on events. 
  Here is the presentation for the 2:30 meeting today

  FYI - I made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together TW/NNG revenue summaries for review by the bankers that Rod/Kevin are working with.  Thought you might me interested in the report.  It gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties. 
  The Phase VI upgrade wasn't on the list of projects that Gary submitted, but not to worry as you will see on the attached it is and always has been part of my overall Gas Logistics capital budget.

  Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650. 
  FYI - Thought you might be interested in Gary Smith's response to these questions 
 I keep getting these notes.  Help! 
 Jean -- I keep getting these messages.  I just got another batch of 6 similar reminders 
  First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers). 
   Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.  Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.  At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.  Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.  I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season. 
 Please come by to sign the certificates. 
 Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.  My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.  But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.  I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.  Can you recommend an ENT?  Looking forward to seeing you soon. 
  Hi Becky,  I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.  I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.  She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.  Shelley 
  Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow).   This is all a shock. I will have to travel by myself.  I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited.  I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs.   I am very excited to see you though.  Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow.  Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday.  I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days.  But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston.  So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work.  I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer.  I will bring pictures of your visit this summer.  I will also bring warm clothes!  I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz.  I am so happy to hear that she has a family. 
 Hi Sherene,  Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball.  I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.  Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.   A box is on its way to you.  Have a blessed holiday.  Love Shelley 
  I'm planning on heading out the office around 3 PM or so.  Feel free to send home staff as business needs permit.  I'm not planning on sending out any kind of notice to all Gas Logistics -- as I feel like it is frustrating to those that must stay.  Have a safe and happy holiday.   I'll be in Austin tomorrow & Friday, so call me on my cell (713-857-2103) or email me if you need me.  In case of emergency, I can be reached at my brother-in-law's house in Austin at 512-474-5631. 
  Jackie,  I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13.  I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday.  Shelley 
  John,  Per Stan Horton's voicemail, attached is letter from you as the pipeline segment board chair to the GISB office indicating the pipeline segment's desire to fill Stan's seat for the December 5 Board Meeting.

  A couple of thoughts  -  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.  - If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.  - I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot. 
  Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.  Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.    Here is the missing language   STATE OF TEXAS COUNTY OF HARRIS  Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.    My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.  On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.   You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk. 
  Kim,  My nonstop direct from Houston cleared for tomorrow (4:40 PM).  The only catch is that I have to go to the airport this afternoon to change my tickets.  My return back from Moscow on the 30th also cleared.   I am still waitlisted for a return flight from Almaty on the 23rd. 
  Stan is having a 1/2 day staff meeting next Wed.  Dec 12 until lunchtime.   Accordingly, I need to reschedule my staff meeting. Please let me know about your availability to meet from 1-3 PM on Dec. 12 in my office. 
  I haven't received my dossier. 
 When I asked you to adjust the Gas Logistic's PAA's to $100, I forgot to ask you to do the same on the separate PAA for gift checks for EOTT pipeline control.  Please give me a call if you need any supplemental paperwork from me.  Happy Holidays 
   Fran,  I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.  I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).  I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.  I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues: - Stop PAC contributions - Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases - Stop 2002 United Way deduct.  I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).  My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.  Thanks in advance for your help. 
 Attached is a copy of Theresa's mid-yr review 
 Sorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.  As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.  I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.  I am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.  I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  Will the assistance service help me at customs?  Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?  Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
 Alma/Lisa,  I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back? 
 Here is a sample of articles 
  If you don't know about the NNG quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet.  I'm hoping to have a conversation with Mary Kay tomorrow before its posted. Thanks.  Get back to your kid stuff now! 
  Bob,  FYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations. 
 Kevin,  Please call ASAP.  While I have been working through the theory on how to make this happen, but I don't know the details on which pipelines and which accounts. 
 I would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with adescription from the reps about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.  Especially Peoples.  On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Jennie,  When you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.  If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.  I don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).   I would like to make such a reservation is possible.  I think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.  Please call me when you get a chance.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
 I'll have someone pull the volumes in the morning if its not too late.  Sorry but my messages didn't come across my blackberry when I was in Austin Fri & Sat. 
 Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues. 
 Perhaps this can help with the non-Red Rock piece.  This spreadsheet takes current rates and multiples out against MDQ for 2002.   It also show billing units through 2005.  I have reconciled this schedule with Jan Moore and Lindy Donoho 
 Thanks.  If you could have Richard add the volumes in as columns into this schedule format that would be great.  Rod needs this ASAP.  Are you available to come by for a few minutes before staff meeting?  I need to talk to you about a new round of due diligence and a conference call this afternoon. 
 Thanks for your note!  I guess you're living proof that one can successfully make it through the twists and turns of international adoption. 
 Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties. 
 Thanks.  Don't know how that happened.  I'll call you when I get downstairs tomorrow am. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

I'm sure that Kim, Chad, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.  You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat. night.  Have fun at the violin concert. 
 I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  - When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence - When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters - And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.  I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family. 
 Thanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!  I will be traveling out of the country next week.  Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.

 Rick - Stan has announced that there is a hiring freeze in effect.  We will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to Stan.  Couple this with the fact that I need to present to Danny/Stan a proposal on how we can trim our 2002 O&M and I'm not inclined to make such a pick.   Lets talk about how we can redeploy our current resources to cover....I especially want to talk about how we pick use the accounting coordinators in an expanded role. 
 Yes, please assure Galen of his need to recuperate.  Will you send him a fruit basket from the group.  How are you coming at getting Debbie Thompson or Blair or Larry Berger lined up? 
  I would like these individuals to have a training with Teb Lokey today or tomorrow.    Teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time. 
 Thanks Gary.  This is an excellent plan. 
 My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.

  Thank you for your thoughts.  I am fine.   Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.  While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there! 
 Ditto back at you.  Sounds like things have been crazy at Halliburton this week. 
 I know you were being nice and I am sorry.  I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.  My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics.  Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

 Thanks for the information.  Do you happen to have an email address for Elza? 
 Thank you for your kind note.  Frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year, I don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will  handle anything that comes our way. 
 I had Kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so I can fedex tonight.  I am so bummed about Jan. travel date and not having Alina for Christmas. Is this for sure? Was she speaking just about me or was she saying Jan 1 for you too?   Why Jan 1?  If there holidays are Dec 30-Jan 1, then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then, so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays?  Sorry for all the venting! 
 Almost 100% certain that its just me.  I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs). 
 Just got home from work ... but that is funny, cause I'm still working -- now at home.  Guess you've probably heard about events at my company.  If you couldn't see the red -- the editorial notes were also in parentheticals  You dickens -- you were only supposed to get Chad 1 item from the list.  Then I pass it on to Tracey, Pat, Arliene etc. 
 Yes can do. 
 I know that the long term solution rests with Charlie Thompson.  But, Caroline, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.  I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.  I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS. 
 Will call you at 9 tonight.

  Peggy,  Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you.  I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.  I am so happy for you.  I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people.  Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch.  I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions.  I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl.  Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.

 Sorry for the delay.  My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!  Remember that conversation we had about 2001.  I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.  Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.  Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.  So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.  Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.  I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.  But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow.  Surely they have some sort of ISP access.  My current ISP is Compuserve.

 No thank you for all you and your teammates do.  I get a bit frustrated when Stan says that "we all need to  re-focused back to work.  I need to remind him that we have never lost our focus, that despite what has been going on, our staff has continued to work 24/7 to maintain our service level to our customers.

 Please remove my name from you solicitation list 
 Thank you.  These are great! 
  Rae,  Just a heads up -- pending pipeline board rep approval, Stan asked that I prepare the attached letter for John Somerhalder to send to the GISB office if this is appropriate form. 
 I agree that this is the revised capital budget that we should submit. 
 Please call.  I'm confused about the hotel amount.  Alma - we will hand out the prizes in a raffle on the date of our holiday luncheon on Dec. 11. 
  I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling. 
 Please provide written notice of postponement and tell them to bill us. 
 I'll take care of the programs 
 Okay - now I've lost the file.  I guess I deleted the wrong message.  Can you resend?

  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION  Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No. RP01-278-002  NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING  (October 22, 2001)  Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective October 1, 2001:  Primary Third Revised Sheet No. 181 Third Revised Sheet No. 182 Third Revised Sheet No. 183 Sheet No. 184 (reserved) Second Revised Sheet No. 185  Alternate Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181 Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182 Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183  Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%. However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section 154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.

  We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts.   Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities. 
 Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions.  You show $3 Million in savings.  I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap. budget.  In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included. 
 It is late in the day

 I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.  AWESOME VISIT On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed! The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement! As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome. Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World. 
 Thanks.  I went to see Dr.  Shelley Leeds Rickets this am.She is a Baylor grad and is very nice.  Glad you weren't in an accident today.  Have a good trip. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Alma - can you copy me on the RSVP list for the Thursday party. 
 Liz - I noticed that Luftansa has flights back on Dec 27 from Moscow.   Using the same itinerary that we discussed before -- but for Dec 11 returning Dec 27 listed fare is $2830.40. 
  We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.  If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.  Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.  I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.     We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.  You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.  In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply. 
  I'll be on the call for the first 1/2 hour.  Theresa will be on for the who= le call.  We can re-group to talk about comments after the call. 
 FYI 
  Chris,  I never heard back from you after I sent the fax yesterday.  I am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the INS forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
   Gina,  Did you ever prepare a set of talking points on the separateness of the pipelines from Enron. 
  I know you are swamped with other matters, so I jotted down in memo form my travel plans.  I guess it's Murphy's Law that I got the phone call that I need to travel now in the midst of current work events. 
  Catherine,  I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.  My husband and son are staying back.  I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.   I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.  I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.  Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.  Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to Houston around Dec 30.  This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.  I will certainly miss being away from home at Christmas and am hoping to find a Christmas worship service in Almaty.   I'd appreciate any advice in this regard.  I would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring.  Thanks Shelley Corman  shelley.corman@enron.com  and  cormanerb@cs.com

 When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.  While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing. 
 Jennie - This looks okay if I wait for my husband or Liz to go on the 20th -- although I think the return would need to be extended a  day or so.  Could you also see about if I am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave Sat.  I was searching the Internet and it looks like the Lufthansa flight is still available on Sat.  I need to make some quick decisions about what I'm doing tomorrow. 
 See you at noon. 
 Jennie,  I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements.  I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning.  I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed. Jan 9.  My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ?  Please advise  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 scorman@enron.com 
 Terrific.  I called to let Kim know.  They will be leaving in just a few hours.  One last item.  Can you make them a reservation on this flight.

 Tonya,  Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  Ginger and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.  Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.  Shelley 
 Donna,  Here is the draft written performance review that I prepared while I was traveling.  I would be happy to sit down and discuss with you in person at your convenience. 
 Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.  Next week sounds fine for vacation.  I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.
