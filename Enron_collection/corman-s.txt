  fyi 
  I'm fine with these latest changes to our OBA mark-up. 
 Chris,  I also wanted to mention that I confirmed the Connie Davis of Travel Brokers received our passports and Kazakstan and Russian visa applications and is holding them pending instructions from you.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 (work) 713-857-2013 (cell) 
 Ginger/Chris,  The Orphans petitions coordinator at the Houston INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.

  Hi Ms. Traylor,  I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.  Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month. Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.  I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.  While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.  Regards,  Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom) scorman@enron.com 
  Do you know?

  Here is my two cents...  From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on our property or destroy the tree.  A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue. Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.  Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down. 
 Please add to my personal contact list 
 Thanks for the invite.  Unfortunately, we have a customer meeting at South Shore Harbor that day.  Hope you are doing well.  I haven't made it home to a football game yet this year -- although I guess that has been a blessing.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083 
 FYI 
 Kent,  I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.  I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.  Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.  Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it. 
 Thanks.  I got your voice message.  I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style. 
 It has been terrific to correspond with Liz & satisfying to help her get info on Oksana from my correspondence with Larisa.  My dossier is with Ginger, hopefully being translated.  I have not yet received my INS approval and I'm scared that I'll anger them if I start calling. 
 Too much partying yesterday -- so I didn't finish my homework.  I'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the Commission meeting.  So I'll send them to you by 10:30 AM of so.  If you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know. 
 No revenue is better.  I've already been over our O&M with my directors. 
 Thanks for the info 
 I'll be at the meeting Friday.  Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.   Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M? 
 Glad you had fun -- but sorry the Astros didn't do their part!

 Danny,  Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday Brad took Jodie Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).  Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with Mike Bryant and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.  Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.  I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements. 
 Mike - I'll be out at the Ops. conference until 9 AM.  Could you please coordinate the meeting time at the Enron building with Jude/Bill.  Ricki I'm assuming that you have set our travel to ballpark.  Also, I want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while.  Mike - Can we quickly pull together dinner/happy hour plans (casual) downtown after the game (perhaps Ricki could reserve a spot for 10 at the old Irma's over by the ballpark) where Dannis, Steve, Jack, Rachel, schedulers, etc. meet us.  I need to leave downtown by 7 PM for a meeting this evening and I want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements. 
 Please RSVP that I will attend. 
 Jo, Kent & Dave,  Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to:  - Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info. - Add additional interconnect points - Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area - Improve formatting and readability.  Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report.  Please confirm that it meets with your expectations. We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week. 
  I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  Shelley is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and Kim as a couple since that time.  Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents to their six-year old son Chad.  It has been a delight to watch them raise Chad to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.  Sincerely  Christi Nicolay {contact info}   Please call Ava Garcia to pick it up when done.  Thanks -- I'll call you tonight 
  Caroline - Would you be amenable to renaming your weekly report?  There is some confusion that this report is the Gas Logistics report.  Thanks for your help.

  I talked to Ginger this morning.  She received my dossier and is sending it for translation.  She said she will be at Chris Ivins today reviewing dossiers.  She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in Austin.  I asked Ginger to send you the picture of Oksana.  She said that she thought she had already had.  She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later.  Talk to you soon. 
 Sorry but Lynn already gave it away 
 I can't join you in walking this year, but you can put me down for a $50 contribution.  I don't need a shirt though -- I still have JDF shirts from years past.

  Liz,  I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.  Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.  We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.  One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.  Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

 Yes Thank You -  The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today.  I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today. 
 I think we expected it.  The ALJ said he need more time for his decision.  On a positive note, it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement 
      I would propose to use only the Mainline West sheet. 
 Thanks for you voice message.  I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday.  In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.   He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.  I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.  Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter. 
  Please forward this letter & invoice to GulfSouth.  I am sending an email copy to Claire. 
 Please mark on my calendar & print out this file. 
 Suzanne,  Hope you are doing well.  Any update on when Gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy?  I was hoping that I might be in a position to forward to the INS later this week.   I have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on INS approval.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083

 Sounds interesting (although I don't have capital dollars at this point for= modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).   Let me touch base wi= th my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you. 
  Pam,  Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.  On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.  I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group. 
  Gary -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee contact information during Tropical Storm Allison & during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.  When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.  Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-Enron ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the Enron intranet or servers are down? 
 With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:  1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.  2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well.... 
 Please save these files to a diskette for me, make a copy (so I can store o= ne at home) & label the files Customer E-Mail Contact Info. 
  Please store this info for me 
 Mike - I have Stan's staff meeting at 8. 
 Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.  I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the standardization. 
 Sure -- Let me first make a run at the business needs and then prior to the= general notice email, I'll take care of charitable requests.  Good idea. =20 
  Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.    My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions - where storage allocation notices appear - why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.  Fixes already put in place In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:  - Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls - Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings - Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime - We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages - Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators - Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ} 
  I'm fine with the filing

 Yes, I'm taking off tomorrow.  Wish you could too.  I'm planning on taking Chad to the Zoo. 
 Hi,  Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.  Two other items when you get a chance: -Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date. -Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.  Shelley 
 Hi Cyndi,  Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound?  Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow. 
 Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs.  They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.  Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case. RE: G-33. DOCKET# GX01-1 000 Discussion of Gas Pipeline Operational Flow Orders

 Suzanne,  Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.  I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.  Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?  I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow. 
 Thanks for the update. 
  This order is even better.  It says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake.  http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/GAS/TM/TM996-29.00C.TXT

  A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint  1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).  3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case. 
 Catherine,  Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.  This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.

 I'm flexible on the departure time 
 Letter looks good.  Just a few thoughts:  - In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done? - Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?  Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter? 
   Here are my additional suggestions 
 Toby,  Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't each outage posting be its own document? 
  Toby,  Can you please provide me with a complete set of all the postings & extentions related to the outage to remove the MOPS 831 platform (starting around Aug 24 and continued several times). 
 Andy - I may join by phone, depending on logistics this afternoon.  I'll let you know. 
   Jackie,  Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:  Children's Church Update  A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.  The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!   Thanks Shelley 713-853-7083  P.S.  Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance. 
 Thanks looks good.  I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details! 
  FYI  While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates. For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

 These both track with the last drafts that I saw and commented on. 
  When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.  In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. "Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board, consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. "  Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of? 
  Here is what I started working on yesterday -- it isn't very far along. 
 Ricki -- I think it's working. 
 Sarah,  Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  For example, for calendar year 1997: Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.   Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.  Call me at x37083 if you have questions. 
  FYI 
 Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics   In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.   I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.   I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.  As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled. 
  Joceyln,  I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.  Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.  Thanks

  Hi Ginger & Chris,  Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.  When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  After I get off the phone I always think of  que
