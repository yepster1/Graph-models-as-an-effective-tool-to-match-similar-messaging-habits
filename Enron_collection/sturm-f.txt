 Jenny,  It looks like I need to read my e-mail more often.  I'll start using it tomorrow (Mon).  Fletch 
 Please make sure that Fletcher J Sturm is marked for a spot in the new parking garage.  Thanks Tjae 
 I would like to park in the new parking garage.  Please put me down for a "yes" to participate.  Fletcher J. Sturm 3-9684 
 yes, I would be interested  fletch 
 Please put this on my calendar, thanks  fletch 
 Ted,  Please mark me down for the dinner on Apr 10  Fletch 
 ok, just send them to TJ when you can and ask her to put them on my calendar.  thanks,  fletch 
 i'll be available  fletch 
 Frank,  This guy called me because he read the book I wrote about Natural Gas.  He has some kind of special treatment with the federal government in terms of gas purchases.  Sounds like a minority owned business to me.  Could you call him or refer him to someone at EES?  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm  Don Cooper 703-683-6839 
 Caroline,  Sorry I haven't checked my e-mail in a while, but that's trading...I'm more interested in Cinergy, but would like to see a deal done no matter where. Let me know if I can help.  Fletch 
 Ted,  Please put her on the list of candidates for the next beginning rotation for Trader Track.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 just checking to see if you had any interest?  fletch 
 please check Jeff King's VAR...it dosn't look right  fletch sturm 
 I'm not sure, but I think it's a data file for the charting software that I use.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm 
 you're cool 
 Attached is the form I'd like everyone to use for tomorrow's reports.  We will probably modify this and the ones to follow, so be prepared!  Fletch 
 TJ, Please put on my calendar for every Tues., thanks.  Also, please notify my team that we will have a meeting with the marketing group every Mon at 3:30pm that Ed Baughman should be setting up with you.  That should be a weekly thing too.  Fletch 
 what does this mean?  Fletch 
 how about 3:15 or 3:30?  fletch 
 Jenny,  Thanks for the response.  I was under the impression that what you and I had worked out was more of a temporary fix and that there was another group working on a perrmanent solution for all of us.  I'm still obviously trading options, but would like you or JP or someone else in risk run a standard report for me each morning which shows my net delta positions by month and the subsequent gamma positions for certain $ moves in the underlying.  I could have Peter do it at night if it needs to be done before calc.  Just let me know.  Thanks,  Fletch  p.s.  sorry if it seems like this is being blown out of proportion

 great man...we just lifted a new pad too this past weekend...Bunker Hill area...sweet  fletch 
 no way       just kidding...you get 'em...just tell TJ to put any vacation days you want to schedule on my calendar.  thanks  fletch 
 Jeff,  Thanks for inviting me to be in the Round Table.  I think it'll be a success.  I'm able to make it to dinner tomorrow night for the Tiger Team deal.  Fletch  p.s.  did you close on your house yet? 
 I'm pretty sure we're good to go.  Check back with you on the restaurant.  Fletch 
 T Jae,  Please put this on my calendar.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 T Jae,  Please put this on my calendar and remind me beforehand if you would.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 sorry, just got your e-mail...I actually don't have any in hand anyway. thanks for your interest.  fletch sturm 
 Thank you very much for doing that for me!  Fletch 
 please put this on my calendar.  thanks,  fletch 
 Dave,  John Lavorato would like me to get back with him regarding exactly why we can't send out a pop-up window to advertise the new power products that we're launching this week.  Could you call or e-mail back?  He basically said he wants to do one, but I don't want to if it could crash all of EOL on our behalf.  Let me know.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 TJ,  We'll need another room.  These meetings are only for the MidWest traders. The meeting with the guy from PJM is for the northeast group.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 TJ,  Please put this on my calendar.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 thanks for the follow-up, fletch 
 Ted,  I'll be out of town this weekend (Oct 27/28), but you can put me down for the s/s on Nov 4.  Please send details.  Fletch Sturm 
 Patti,  What do I do with this now?  How do I get the $50?  Can I wait and get a series of months reimbursed later or do I have to go through this every month?  Fletch Sturm 
 yes 
 Janelle,  That's a great product with a simple explanation.  I have blank deal tickets ready to be filled in!  Good luck.  Fletch

 Lavo,  I'm in for dinner tonight for sure and golf Sun a.m. if you're able.  Oh EOG...how I love thee!  +2 1/4  Fletch 
 Terri,  Hi!  Thanks for your interest in my book.  You should be able to get one at www.amazon.com the fastest.  If they're out, or say it will take a while, go directly to www.pennwell.com  (this is the publisher.)  Again, thanks.  Fletch Sturm 
 Please put this on my calendar and remind me.  thanks,  fletch 
 The name is Wallingford, McDonald, Fox and Company on SW Freeway at Buffalo Speedway. 
 Bombs away...  Fletch 
 Right shoulder complete...full reversal mode as of right now...bang!  Fletch 
 good luck...I'm sure you'll do well!  Have fun  fletch 
 jenny, i'd really like to be able to set my curves through Dec '03 without having to freak with that g.d. contango weighting table in the MW4 file.  the market changes so fast during the day that i don't have time to switch between my MWSum and MW4 files fast enough to keep up with it.  i have a section in the MWSum spreadsheet where i keep all of the quick calcs on the calendars, so i could link that to the MW4 file like i'm doing through Oct '02.  come by tomorrow (Fri) and i'll show you what the h i'm talking about. fletch 
 Eric,  The products have been launched (Mon) and did trade a couple times.  As far as another article in GD, i'll check with John, but I think it's a good idea.  Fletch 
 Please put this on my schedule.  thanks,  fletch 
 Eric,  I've been out of the office for two days, but just received this message and it's great.  Let me know what else I can do!  Fletch 
 David,  Yes, i'm interested in meeting with these guys, but i'm unavailable until Thu or Fri.  Let me know if I can sit in on a meeting.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm x3-6219 
 good morning!  just wondering if you've talked to Gas Daily yet and if you need anything more from me...also, i'd like to see what you're going to give to them (G.D.) with regard to facts about the products, EOL, etc...  we'd like to launch the products on Fri and have the article appear on Mon because the audience should be bigger than Fri.  fletch 
 Yes, the plan is to roll the new products out on Fri., the 22nd.  fletch 
 Eric,  This guy is a friend of mine and he said he'll put in some good words about EOL and especially the new product that we're going to launch.  His name is Chris McDonald at Southern  (678) 579-3298.  He runs the West gas trading at Southern.  Fletch 
 Eric,  The name I have at El Paso is Tim Bourne 713-420-3826.  Todd Geiger is my contact over there.  He's a Vice President and told me that Tim runs the trading group and would not be in the office until Mon. next week.  Fletch 
 Eloy,  Who is General Brinks?  Fletch 
 Here is the list for you to keep:  Duke   John Thomas  (713) 260-8569 Utilicorp Mark Gurley  (816) 527-1758 El Paso  Bo Collins  (713) 420-3466 Southern Gary Morshes  (678) 579-5323 Dynegy  Matt Schatzman  (713) 509-6438  Fletch 
 Terri,  Do you think we're close enough to book the deals.  Rogers and I keep forgetting that they're not in our positions everyday.  Fletch 
 Melba,  Could you see to this please?  Thanks,  Fletch 
 Brad,  (see message below from Melba)  Which one should we use, and how should it look on the website?  Remember, only five characters will fit in the name.  Maybe just CNGNo? Let me know and i'll forward to Melba.  Fletch 
 John,  The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to Sitara and Tagg.  I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells me they should be ready tomorrow.  Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.  For now, we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.  Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format:  US GAS BASIS      GD/D SoCal - HHub  The only product that will be different is the Nymex to daily swap which will be:  US GAS BASIS      NXL1 - GD/D HHub  Any questions or comments,  Fletch x3-6219 
 these looks good to me except for the lower case "h" in the Hub phys that we already talked about.  fletch 
 also, if "NL1" appears anywhere else, change it to NXL1  thanks  fletch 
 one more change...NL1 change to NXL1  flet 
 The following is a list of daily basis product names that we would like to create, all of which are US GAS BASIS deal type:  GD/D Mich-HHub GD/D Chic-HHub GD/D Pepl-HHub GD/D Demrc-HHub GD/D HSC-HHub GD/D Waha-HHub GD/D Perm-HHub GD/D SanJn-HHub GD/D Opal-HHub GD/D SOCAL-HHub GD/D TZ6NY-HHub GD/D TecoP-HHub   (short for Teco Pool) GD/D CNGAp-HHub GD/D TETM3-HHub GD/D TenLa-HHub GD/D TZ3-HHub GD/D Nymex-HHub GD/D CGulf-HHub  I have put a call in to Mark Taylor regarding new product descriptions, but have yet to hear back from him.  Fletch 
 Dale,  The product that crosses monthly and daily swaps is the IF vs GD index swap that we currently offer.  I'll call you later...no time right now to write more.  Fletch 
 Dale,  I agree with your proposed changes  fletch 
 Under the alternative "bumping" method, if the market is 3.75/5.25 and our EOL and ICE market's are both 4/5 in that case, would we pay brokerage if someone executes on ICE rather than EOL?  Fletch 
 Jeff,  With little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation constraints, etc., it's going to be difficult for me to say, geographically, where I think the boundaries ought to be.  However, I think the market would always prefer a simple layout, something like MISO - West, - Central, - East, - South.  To me, I think that would cover the basic areas that trade differently in terms of price.  Fletch 
 If you haven't received the details yet, here they are (Enron sells):  30,000 MMBtu/d   Nov '00 - Mar '01   ANR LA @ Index + $0.01 30,000 MMBtu/d   Nov '00 - Mar '01   NGP LA @ Index + $0.01 40,000 MMBtu/d   Nov '00 - Mar '01   TRUNK LA @ Index + $0.01  If you need anything else,  Fletch x3-6219 
 Sorry, but I've been out of town since you sent this.  There have been a couple of errors pointed out to me since the publishing, most of which have apparently been somewhat obvious (i.e. not difficult to figure out).  I'll look into this one and get back to you.  Fletcher Sturm  p.s.  Thanks for your support! 
 Please put this on my calendar if you haven't already.  fletch 
 Melba,  I'm sorry I haven't replied sooner, but there is a decision to be made about what type of product these should fall under...Gas Daily, or Basis.  We're afraid that if we categorize them as Gas Daily, then anyone who logs onto the site looking for basis would miss these products altogether.  The "US GAS DAILY  HeHub - CHIC" is cleary the best description for the website.  I'll get back to you as soon as we make a decision.  Fletch 
 Rain,  Please sign me up for the class on Fri. (8/11).  Thanks,  Fletch 
 sorry so late  Fletch 
 yes, that would be fine.  fletch 
 Scott,  Please take me off the global e-mail list...  Thanks,  Fletch @ enron 
 Rain,  Please put this on my calendar.  Thanks,  Fletch 
 Marc,  Sorry, we don't have anything open right now.  Possibly in 6 months or so.  Fletch 
 Rain,  I'd like to coordinate this with the other fellas (Hunter, Scott, etc.) =20 Let's see if we can all go to the same one!  Fletch 
 anytime after 4:30pm is fine...I am at EB-3233C  Fletch 
 Scott,  I'm receiving faxes from you guys everyday, and would just like to be taken off the global e-mail distribution.  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm Enron 
 Sheri,  Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.  I'd like to have her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the website.  I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't know about the others.  In addition, her trades (stack manager customer trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).  If you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.  Thanks,  Fletcher Sturm x36219 
 Melba,  The description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing...How about the following:  Floating price A: Gas Daily midpoint for Henry Hub  Floating price B: Gas Daily midpoint for __________  Buyer pays Floating price A plus applicable basis, seller pays Floating price B   We should substitute your long description for "Gas Daily midpoint" above. Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products.  Fletch Sturm x3-6219
