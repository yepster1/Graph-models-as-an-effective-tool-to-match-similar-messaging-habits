 Just so you can see how this is evolving... I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because it sounds like we are buying/selling gas. I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only information she still needs from us, I think. I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today. 
 I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA; I'm with ETS Legal. 
 In response to your question of whether Transwestern Pipeline needs to renew its bond (Bond No. 22000455) to the State of Oklahoma, the answer is yes.  If you have any questions, please call me at x30596. 
 Darin, that is fine.  Revised agreement attached. 
 given that I don't even know what UAF is, I will plan to attend. 
 I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.  If you would like a copy of the complaint, let me know. 
 Maria reminded me that we are required to file a rate case to be effective Nov. 1, 2006. We could file one before then as to non-Current Firm Shippers, but I doubt we will. Any other questions -- let me know. 
 Attached is the final version of the Interconnect Agreement.    I've changed Section 4.2 in accordance with our e-mail discussion. Additionally, I've filled in the blanks for POI# and date of commencement of construction, and added an Exhibit A (and a reference to Exhibit A in the definition of "Facilities") listing what will be installed.  Darin, kindly fill in the appropriate contact information on page 11, have the agreement executed by EPFS in duplicate originals, and return both originals to me.  I will return a fully executed original to you.  Lorraine Lindberg will be forwarding you wire transfer information for the payments that are due from EPFS upon execution.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Lorraine will be on vacation as of tomorrow.  Thank you,  Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 (713) 853-0596 
 Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the "negligence" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated out in the first place).  So it would read:  4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and servants, contractors and subcontractors ("Indemnified Party" or "Indemnified Parties") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement.  b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of EPFS or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement.  c.  [same as current version] d. [same as current version] 
 Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course need to be filled in for $$ amount and term. Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two agreements, let me know. 
 Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as "firm" or "interruptible" since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM is comfortable with all this before we file anything.  Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15. 
 Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request that we provide "something in writing."  This is basically just a description of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information to raise a lot of questions.  Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to provide something to them tomorrow. 
 Don't you have work to do?? : ) 
 You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief explanation.  Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with eliminating "stockholders" and the "...judgments of any nature..." clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a. and b.  Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement. TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and DOT standards. (By the way, I believe the "notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the contrary" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)  Any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596). 
 Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make "operational" sales of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine. By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.  Let me know if you have further questions. 
 For your information.  If you have any questions, let me know... 
 Attached is a memo addressing the question of whether TW could acquire capacity on a competitor pipeline in lieu of a physical expansion.  Please e-mail or call (x30596) if you have any questions, or if you would like me to set up a meeting to discuss this further. 
 Kevin, let me know if you have any questions... 
 Christine, I spoke with Drew and he is OK with the changes shown in the attached.  Questions--let me know. 
 Fun quizzes from Cosmo...  http://cosmo.women.com/cos/you/quiz/00quiz11.htm 
 Approved, subject to Drew's approval.  (Drew, the agency letter is the same as the one with Oneok, except we've omitted some meaningless language that Oneok had requested.) 
 Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know. Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since you live so close to the airport!  Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as it did.  You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.  w/b Susan 
 Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.  I think it will work fine.  TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.  The difference between actual and billed amounts is very little.  Thanks for your attention to this last week. 
 Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 will be held on Jan. 9 at 10:00.  A notice will be issued shortly. 
 Please see the attached and let me know if you have questions.  If it looks OK to you and the 1/2 reimbursement arrangement is OK with EPFS, please forward to James Centilli for his review.  Thanks. 
 Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom! Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with you. 
 Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!  The handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've noticed that needs fixing let me know. 
 Hi Mum!  What an eventful few days it has been.  Sorry I didn't call over the weekend.  I had my hands full painting my bedroom!  It took forever!  Luckily I got the color right on the first try:  the Happy Yellow looks pretty good. Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis tournament, which was fun.  It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the theater/art group I've been interested in joining.  In fact, yesterday I got a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!  I'm really excited and am expecting good news.  This could be an auspicious start to life after law for me! Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.  It went by too quickly!  I hope you're having a good week; let me hear from you! Love, Sooz. 
 Thanks Robert, this is a big help. Just wondering -- you make the statement that "El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities..."  Do you think that our having an interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of saying this is not a CIAC? 
 I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Christine and Bob and made them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.  I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let me know what you think. 
 I think there was a problem when I tried to send this before...so here it comes again. 
 Hi DeShonda,  I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't h= eard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenie= nce and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.  Thanks, Susan M. Scott X31455 
 nope...dinner...bed 
 Disregard the last bit of the previous email...I tracked down a ride. 
 No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though.  Sue  This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home? 
 Caycie,  I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).  I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.  Love, Sue  PS - Are you coming in for Deborah's wedding? 
 Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.  As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.  Needless to say it was a big night.  Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have "get-up-and-go" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).  I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.  Cheers  I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on... 
 What happened to you last Wednesday?  Were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew?  Hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well.  I just dropped the Earl a line to see if he's still breathing.  I'll let you know if I hear anything back.  Caio 
 Christine, I made a few changes for purposes of clarification. 
 Are you still alive?  I'm just checking b/c I haven't heard a peep out of you in a while.  Drop me a line and let me know what's up. 
 that's okay...i'm used to it at this point  thanks 
 I was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.  If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).  I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to Lisa about this and I need a co-conspirator.  Sue 
 I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.  What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility. 
 I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.  I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I?  And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.  One of those things you'll never really forget.  I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things.  Sue 
 Hey girls...I hate this, but I may be out Thursday.  Please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes I'll meet you there.  Otherwise, have a great time and to both Lisa and Jen, I need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal           ( both are very good things and I love good things ).  Sue 
 Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:  I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).  The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.  Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.  Sue  PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related. 
 I'm sure she knows you're CC'd her on the email...she wants you to witness the flirtation.  She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.  I told her I sent it to him.  She said, "I didn't think you knew his last name?"  To which I responded, "I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Kenneally's that  I'd send it when I got the chance."  Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the "let's just be friends talk" last week ( which I think was the right move ).  Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.  Nothing bad, just a good little story.  Sue 
 Congrats!....Lisa told me the good news last night.  Can't wait for the big= day, I know you guys will be very happy together.   =20 
 I had some appetizers the other day at the MFA that were provided by Aries and they were very good.  Definitely wouldn't mind trying that place. 
 I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.  I really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality obligations.  I need to get Drew's clearance for Colorado law; I'll get back to you. 
 Either option sounds good to me.  Just send an email with the time and place when you guys figure it out and I'll be there. 
 Vegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - (713) 775-6472.  If I'd spent any longer  than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.  I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am. 
 Give me a call whenever you get in... 
 Try hard... 
 Vegas baby!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait...our flight arrives around 6:00 and then we head back Sunday morning.  It's a "work" trip.  Will do on pitching the 12th to the gang.  Sue 
 Hey there,  Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!  Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight.  Sue 
 I'll see you guys there. 
 Had a bit of an encounter with Ted last night.  Turns out it wasn't as bad = as I thought it was based upon the email below.  Start from the bottom and = work your way up.  FYI he's kidding about the MD (managing director) and Go= d comments. 
 Like I said...I'm in.  What time is "right after work" for everyone? 
 The email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it = for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.  I know you= can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard= what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys= are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good wor= k!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just t= hat no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that= would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you= that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what = you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ...= .." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity= - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely lovin= g it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades g= o into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my= own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job= allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Roc= kets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o= ff to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Port= land.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so = there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.  No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everythin= g I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so = witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel..= .always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itse= lf for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary = to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always act= s on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hea= ring is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtl= e but important difference.  Shorty  - You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think= I may have frightened some people. 
 How about tomorrow? I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format, by the way.  Should make getting a draft out easier.  Here it is if you want to take a look. 
 Next week sounds good to me too.  If everyone wants to meet at Ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work.  Susan had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result.  I can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either!!!! 
 I guess there's some sort of fine for dating...sounds like a load of BS to me.  What's your AOL messenger name? 
 I think this is for you. 
 Ditto.... 
 I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott (sscott3@enron.com)..= .I'm with nat gas trading.  Thanks 
 definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could. 
 I feel okay...just regretting some of my actions from last night.  Oh well, life goes on. 
 Congrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager...I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director.  All things in due time, right? 
 Sorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night, but I hope you had fun at steak night.  It's too bad you didn't make it to Sierra's ( you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly). 
 Are you going to be in Austin next weekend (the 28th)?  I'm thinking about making a trip up there to visit.  Let me know.  Sue 
 Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline Company., 
 Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.  ?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.  ?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.  ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.  ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's "negotiated". Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue. 
 I think it's probably a good idea not to contact Eric for a while.  Truly what purpose would it serve?  As for my work situations, they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me.  I'll tell you about them on my next visit.  See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.  Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.  I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.  To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.  Enough self-analysis.  Have a good evening....you should his jazz night at Epizote just for me.  Sue 
 I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The retaliatio= n/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting. = My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representat= ive of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very short-lived = and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry about the l= ecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just utter flapp= ing as in my case). =20  Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your f= riends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from Clint,= he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were you tho= ugh...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get the impre= ssion that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal interest= I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.  However,= if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's a great = guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in a couple of si= tuations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and = I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same way...something that's h= ard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did o= ccur).  Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much s= leep.  Oh well, life is tough.  Susan 
 I hate forwards...but I do like champagne.

 What's the scoop golf-pro?  Are you in for tonight?  FYI:  The weather is gorgeous outside. 
 Check out  the Southwest website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.  I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.  That way I can spend more on food and drinks.  We can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip. 
 Hey girls,  Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.  Talk to you soon, Sue  P.S.  Katy...my friend Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions. 
 Wrong Susan again...try typing sscott3@enron.com (that's her short email address)...mine is sscott5@enron.com.  If you see the middle initial "M" pop up in the address, you've got the wrong Susan Scott.  Thanks 
 Sorry about the last email...hadn't read this one yet. 
 Are you sure you have the right Susan Scott?  If this is for Click at Home, I've already received my computer.  Try the Susan Scott with legal...her extension is 30596.  Thanks 
 Christine, the "actual fuel usage" provision is probably a material deviation from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect.  If we're using the "actual fuel" language because we anticipate that the fuel usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know. 
 Phillip,  Here's the power point presentation with updated information. 
 Thanks for the help! 
 Any interest in going to the Rockets game tonight.  I have free tickets and it may be Hakeem's last game.  Let me know.  Sue 
 Sounds good to me. 
 I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas tr= ading.  Thanks 
 I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Houston time (713-775-6472).  Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?  I love this job.  Sue 
 Hey Lisa,  Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.  Thanks, Sue 
 So...the weekend I was talking about coming to Austin the following people are playing:  Fri	The Fabulous Thunderbirds	Gruene Hall Fri	Cory Morrow			Luckenbach Dance Hall  Sat	Reckless Kelly			Antone's Sat	Lucinda Williams		Gruene Hall  Just more food for thought.  Sue 
 Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Houston.  Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the pina colodas, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than pina colodas I assure you).  The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.  I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar.  There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.  I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.  It forced me to the realization that the men in Houston, and much of Texas, are soft.  Alas, no exciting stories though...  Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with Susan's tails of woe.  There is definitely ample material.  Sorry to hear about Ben and the girlfriend.  I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go.  Talk to you soon, Sue 
 FYI. 
 Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.  Talk to you soon, Sue 
 Call Ambrosia ? Monday morning 
 Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).  I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries. 
 Thanks Sarah.  That was very touching.  I just forwarded it to a bunch of people...too good not to share.  Hope you have a happy Easter!!!  Love, Sue 
 I couldn't agree more...Happy Holidays!  Sue   Paul Harvey writes: We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I really would. I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like. May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These things I wish for you through tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

 DeShonda,  I had some difficulty replying to the parking & transportation email and just wanted to make sure that you received my request for a space in the new parking garage.  Thanks, Susan M. Scott 
 I would like to be placed in the new garage.  Thanks, Susan M. Scott x31455 
 Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.  Be sure to tell everyone I say, "Hello!"  As for the zoo, I am a huge fan.  It's the only zoo I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.  It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.  Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.  Sue  Em's in the Canary Islands this week...can you believe that little brat? 
 I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.  Sue 
 Hey Julie,  Just wondering if you had any preferences regarding the spa times I emailed you yesterday.  If you get a chance let me know and I will go ahead and make a reservation.  Ciao, Susan 
 Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments.  Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines.  Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.  Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order.  Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

 I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas Trading.  Thanks 
 Hey Kasey,  I just got an email back from KJ and he seemed to think you're going to be in San Diego until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in San Diego.  I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.  If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.  I've got your number from your last visit to Houston so don't be suprised if you hear from me.  Talk to you soon, Sue 
 Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)  Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.  Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.  Time: 90 minutes   Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.  Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.  Time: 90 minutes  Ta Ta, Susan 
 I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful.  = As for baseball, I'd love to stop by for a few innings on Saturday.  It sou= nds like fun and I wouldn't mind checking out the stadium.  I can't stress = enough how flexible I am on all this stuff.  We can wait a while before dec= iding which is our best beach day bet.  I'll check out the spa's schedule r= egarding massages to see what kind of flexibility there is there.  As for t= he clothing I will try to remind myself SD is casual...Houston's gotten pre= tty sassy over the last couple of years.  I always feel underdressed when I= go out here.  Thursday night sounds great...two days and counting. 
 Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to= put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging i= n the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and= I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situa= tions, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I = going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you = suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear any= thing about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure= Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the mor= ning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it'= s going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturd= ay as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on= Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestio= ns... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqu= a and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Pacifica Del M= ar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration.= ..There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but i= f your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously= and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to T= he Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded goo= d for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion= ) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport = somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typicall= y go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night. =20  I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.  In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help= out with a few suggestions.  Love, Susan =09 
 Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion.  *** Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.

 Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?  Susan  Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing. 
 Thanks for the info...I will check into it.  Hope you manage to get some rest.  The wedding was fun, super sweet and huge (800+ at the reception).  I got hit on by a waiter at the rehearsal dinner and groped in the hotel elevator by one of the groomsmen...so I'm up on guys right now.  Talk to you soon, Sue 
 Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought. 
 So do you have any ideas/plans for brunch on Sunday...my guess is there are a ton of places with special Easter Brunches.  I just thought maybe you had a regular spot.  Let me know. 
 I'm flying Continental and I will check my mailbox for the card...I haven't checked it in a while.  I'm going to bring my pictures from the last two weekends ( very fun activities...I tell you all about them this weekend).  Love ya, Susan 
 Hi Ashley,  It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.  Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together.  Talk to you soon, Susan 
 Hi yourself,  I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.  Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.  Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay? ).  No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.  Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal.  My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40 Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as tired).  Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more than ready for a little R&R.  Love, Susan 
 There is only one Susan Scott at Enron that really matters, right?  Best ways to ensure it's me...either use sscott5@enron.com or check to make sure the middle initial that pops up is "M".  Ciao

 You're gonna love this site.  So true.   http://www.petnet.com.au/dogs/D162.html 
 The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the marketing fee.  The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement (i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the attached instead.  Questions or comments -- let me know. 
 You should check out the 2nd deal...there are also trips to Cayman etc. on the same link at great prices.  See ya Saturday, Susan 
 Hey buddy,  Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?  I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.  Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right?  Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?  I promise not to run too late.  Talk to you soon, Susan 
 We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?)  As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right?  Sue  I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight. 
 Sunil,  I promise I have not forgotten about you.  Things around here have just been crazy with the beginning of the month and all.  I should have some time tomorrow to get together if you like, just give me a call.  Talk to you soon, Susan 
 Hey stranger,  Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug.  Talk to you soon, Susan  Hope Law Review isn't wearing you too thin. 
 Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?  The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it.  Talk to you later, Susan 
 Lexi,  I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.  Thanks, Susan x31455 
 Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.  Talk to you later, Sue 
 Yes, I am going home before the reception and am going to have Katy meet me at the apartment around 6:15 (at least that's what time I'm telling her).  If you want to tell Laura to meet at the apartment around that time too, I will be there to greet her.  I'm going to drop off some dry cleaning, finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there.  I'm so glad everyone is up for this outing...we are so culturally aware.  So that's the plan.  I suggest we eat somewhere around the Museum District...I'll do some research this afternoon.  Talk to you later, Sue 
 Here you go....Katy wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the "reception" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.  Let me know if that works for you. 
 Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.  Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval as soon as possible.  Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if possible.  Thank you. 
 If you're on the internet right now, I'm trying to call...our meeting was postponed. 
 When you get a chance, tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July.  I'm trying to figure when I can come visit and not pay too much on airfare, be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work.  I will definitely come over...just don't know if it'll will be when Katy does.  Sue 
 Just got the email myself...will definitely check it out.  Thanks 
 Theresa and Nicole,  Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:  -36169000 -36177000 -33084000 -33085000 -33038000 -31029000 -33171000 -33175000 -116388 -903145 -IT-601 -41066000 -41075000  If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.  Thanks for all the help, Susan x31455 
 Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?  As for dinner, I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference.  I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.  I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here.  Talk to you later, Sue 
 Earl,  Long time...no nothing.  How goes it?  Just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing.  Hope all is well.  We really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours.  Talk to you soon, Susan 
 Hey,  Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.  See ya, Susan 
 Hey,  Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.  I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  Talk to you soon, Sue 
 Sunil,  I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).  I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.  Susan 
 Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly "looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:  Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management approval prior to filing with the Commission. 
 I believe this was intended for the Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas= Trading.  Thanks 
 I'm leaving shortly for the airport, but I will give you a call when I get back so we can discuss transport to SA. I am way too excited about this trip (many pics will be taken).  Susan  I completely agree about foregoing the Mucky Duck Tuesday...too cold and too rainy for me. 
 the Cayman Islands  We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.  Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.  Sue 
 Hey Lisa,  Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).  As for the "Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?  Love ya, Susan  PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long. 
 Yup...I leave for the Caymans today.  Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.  I am, understandably, very excited.  We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.  As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.  The going away party for Kenny should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly.  Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.  See ya next week, Susan 
 Julie,  I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.  I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.  Talk to you soon, Susan 
 Civil War may be sold out...I'm checking on it. 
 Hi Jennifer,  Yes, that is correct.  I would like to contribute $25 in addition to the $50 membership fee.  Thanks for getting back to me and verifying the amounts.  Susan Scott 
 Not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the Options filing in case you need it. 
 I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.  I'll try and give you a call later today.  I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.  It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something.  Susan 
 You can take me off this distribution as I am no longer with risk.  Thanks, Susan 
 So transparent....I will pay you good money to hook-up with this guy.  Would get hours of enjoyment from such an event. 
 I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life.  Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about Lisa always dating someone....she still denies.  Cracks me up.  Response is always,  "I've only had two serious boyfriends."  To which I've started to respond, "We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy.  In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon."  I definitely need this vacation, Sue 
 I believe this was intended for Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas trading.  Thanks 
 I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like "good buddy" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.  On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.  Sue 
 Hey Katy,  I was just curious if you had any interest in attending the reception below.  Sounds like it might be interesting to me.  Drop me a line and let me know if it sounds like fun and I'll go ahead and get a couple of tickets.  Talk to you soon, Susan   2001 Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Corporate Partners Spring Reception, April 3!  Be a part of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston 2001 Corporate Partners Spring Reception on Tuesday, April 3 at Law building of the MFA.  Enjoy great food donated by ARIES Restaurant and The Redwood Grill, free drinks, cool art, and good friends.  To attend or with questions call (713) 639-7585. 
 Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.  I'm still up for this evening if you are.  The "show" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.  Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.  See ya later, Susan 
 He was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird.  Talk to you later, Sue 
 Thanks Shannon...I appreciate all the help you've given me over the last year and would be happy to return the favor in the future if there's anything you need.  Good luck to you as well in your own endeavors.  Susan 
 Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.  1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the following cast of characters:  Steve Harris Kevin Hyatt Lindy Donoho Jeff Fawcett TK Lohman Christine Stokes Michelle Lokay Lorraine Lindberg  When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her (x35849).  2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice.  3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:  - TW Options (a tariff filing) - Order 637 compliance - Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)  4.  Standing meetings:  - TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30 - Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15. - Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)  5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).  6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.  7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information. However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in the right folder is enough.  8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 3rdqtr00, etc.)  9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the calendar.  10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother ("Ms. Savoy"), Dianna  11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure of her location as it seems to change a lot.  I look forward very much to working with you!! 
 Hi Shannon,  Could you be sure to remove my name from the distribution and replace it with George Huan...he has taken over my roll running the options book.  Thanks, Susan 
 Best Product Placement:  Taking corporate sponsorship to absurdly intimate levels, Pepsi spokesdiva Britney Spears wore a tiny medallion with the soft-drink company's logo in her bellybutton ring during her much hyped commercial. Although, considering the amount of money the company has sunk into her, it may have been a homing device. 
 Starts at eight....would love to go, at least for a while.  I'll give you a call later to discuss. 
 FYI:  Trish Murphy is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night....thought you might be interested.  Drop me a line.  Sue 
 I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.  Susan 
 Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the d= ickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things = with you.  Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He ca= me over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lis= a and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the se= cond time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had = to witness the "cuddle fest."  Not to mention the "cuddle fest" we all witn= essed with Chad at Europa.  Maybe if she does come over you could be the li= ttle red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force = her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.  She's in heat righ= t now I swear.  Every 5 sec. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The g= uy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out = of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik prob= ably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful= you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I = mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch= and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she = was of course performing the role of social butterfly).  Like I said, it's = pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her "friends" that have= met Mitch and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told= her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little = better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that = he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at l= east by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette.  Can you believe my parents?  They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs = and took a roll of film...what dorks.  Sue  I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me. 
 I am destined to be a dork....it's in the genes. 
 Matt -- are you going to have Snake Hill sign as well?  I can e-mail the agreement to him if you prefer. Thanks. Susan 
 Lia Hernandez, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at ENA effective August 2, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, Lia's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.  In addition, Lia's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass distribution  lists should be changed.  Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the LAN - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications - email post office box was transfered.  If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know. 
 I'm planning to be out August 28 - Sept 1. 
 Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have questions.  Susan Scott x30596 
 Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to:  - explain filing system - hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and next week is fine) - explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.  Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise access to my Lotus Organizer. Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's station but see if you can do this also.  I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.  Merci beaucoup! 
 I hated to e-mail all of you but I honestly do not know how to handle the attached which was forwarded to me, and thought one of you might.  Any clues...please advise.  Thanks. 
 If there's still space available, please enroll me in the March 14-15 Derivatives I class.  Here's my info:  Susan Scott GPG Legal RC#  0026 Supervisor:  Drew Fossum SSN ********* 713-853-0596 sscott3@enron.com  Thanks. 
 I owe Michele a call because she has a couple of questions.  Will do after I finish options draft. 
 Somehow the "one-part rate" glossary item fell off of TW's list so I've revised it again. 
 I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an "eligible facility" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate. The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec. 157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7(c) certificate.  I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able to find out:  In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral.  Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau rates.  As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However, if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c) application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.  At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.  I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know.    Michele Winckowski                08/17/2000 01:39 PM 
 First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of $650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable.  I'll try to answer all your questions:  Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse as we would be removing light items for heavier items.  A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a waterbed, though!  Q.  The stove is a bit problematic...  A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give the appliance folks a call.  Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed?  A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.  Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for sure?  A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.  Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric?  A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric! If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.  Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?  A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.  Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?  A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.  The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?  As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that's okay with y'all.  Call if you have further questions! 
 Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.  The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 250,000 MMBtu.  // Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically "best efforts" and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so we will need to revise this further.  We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.  They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06).  The ball is in our court. 
 I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps:  1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.)  2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."  As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions. 
 Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the affiliates, by using "funny money," can always make themselves the highest bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay "real" dollars.  While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue.  The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest.  Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting.  If you have any questions or concerns please let me know. 
 Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft.  One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be "market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.  The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.  I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions.  As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think.  Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
 Here is a chart cross-referencing Gas Daily price points with points of TW, for purposes of imbalance valuation.  If you have questions call Jeff or me. 
 I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA.  I'm with ETS Legal. 
 Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.  One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be "market-based."  At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.  The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.  I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics:  1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.  I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting time. I will be out Mon. and Tues. 
 In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for project development:  Retainer:  $1000/month plus expenses Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000 Each month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project) Letter of Intent:  $5000 Signed Agreement:  $10,000 Incentive Fee:  To be determined  When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- $3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only.  The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party "identified by IGS under this agreement."  As you know, the "identified by" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement.  Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the "identified by" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.  I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern.  Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed.    From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions:  1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project.  2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project].  "Accepting the project" means that the project meets Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion.  3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project).  (I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.). 
 Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.  12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:  Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis.  Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.  Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).  The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.  2/18/93 letter amendment:  Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.  9/25/95 letter amendment:  Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective.  My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years.  The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement. 
 FYI. 
 Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).  My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.  Any questions -- give me a call.  S. 
 I do not see any problems with this. 
   You have just received the "Aggie Virus"!!!  Since Aggies arn't very smart and don't have any programming experience, this Virus works on the honor system.  Please delete all the files on your hard drive, and manually forward this Virus to everyone on your mailing list. 
 Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include:  - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work  I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market.  Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
 Here is the agreement with the changes you requested. 
 As you requested. 
 Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc. 
 Matt, here are redlined and clean versions.  Let me know whether the revisions are acceptable.  Thanks, Susan 
 Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call this afternoon. Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already celebrated appropriately! What do you think of my Destin idea? talk to you soon Love, Sooz 
 Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company. The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later that the agreement is not valid. 
 This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this is something HR is not capable of taking care of. 
 Thanks Keith.  Feel free to coordinate with Jeff to put together a meeting to get the info you need.  I do not know the answer to your questions offhand, and Ron is out this week. 
 Approved 
 Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement. 
 Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he?? I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components. My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one component from exceeding the max or going below the min. Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions! 
 Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order to expedite things.  If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by. 
 No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go this weekend.  So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, which was starting to smell like cooked grass.  Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.  The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept? Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.  Time to work! Love, Sooz 
 Darlin', Someone booked the entire Rainbow Lodge for a party this p.m. As alternatives, Chez Sooz recommends: La Mora Brennan's Please advise.  xxxooo S. 
 Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles but does not extend the same privilege to TW.  I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any questions or comments to discuss!  S. 
 After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions= =20 that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quit= e=20 some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been= =20 discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline= =20 site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe= rs=20 yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the= =20 phone & discuss this?  List of TW contracting issues  1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate= =20 policy:  a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total char= ge=20 shall include all applicable surcharges."   Should this language be revised= ,=20 and if so, how?  b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in= =20 its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined= =20 rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20 surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio= ns=20 from the tariff?=20  c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event= =20 shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim= um=20 rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance= that=20 the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective? = =20 necessary?  2.  IOS/EnronOnline:  a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?  b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20 subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20 bidding procedures)?  c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin= g=20 situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20 evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made? 
 According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur? Any comments? 
 David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass distribution  lists should be changed.  Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the LAN - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications - email post office box was transfered.  If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know. 
 For discussion this a.m. 
 I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing.  Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY. 
 Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before.  One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package.  Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call. 
 Oops, I meant to send this note to Mary Darveaux instead -- my apologies! 
 Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So go ahead and order tickets if you like.  I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it is.  Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?  Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.  Love, Sooz 
 We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.  The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can someone help me with this?  Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright. However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer. However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC. Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated. 
 Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14.  The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows:  Final draft comments   Friday, July 14  Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26  Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27  FERC filing    Monday, July 31  Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
 Paul, governing law in paragraph 9 needs to be Texas.  If this is a problem, give me a call because we'll need to discuss it with Drew. Subject to this one change, I approve this agreement. 
 At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could have said it, but ...  Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow. 
 Here's the draft I referred to in my e-mail -- let me know if you have comments or questions. 
 (I haven't reviewed this yet but will have a chance to this afternoon.) 
 Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to FERC decisions.  In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.  In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes operationally available for various reasons from time to time.  But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of "pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is available" that I thought existed. 
 thanks, Donna -- good work. 
 Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word "volumetric" as that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly to have "volumetric" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  "on a daily basis only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized". If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more issues I am sending him to law school as punishment. 
 Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I raised last week? If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and I'll schedule something around them.  Thanks. 
 Since I am swamped I've asked Steve Stojic to take a first crack at it. 
 Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.  Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.  Love, Sooz 
 Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.  1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.  2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.  3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option.  4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether.  5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance.  6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)  If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m. 
 Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some. Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)  I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would appreciate also: http://livingisland.com/shows/pufnstuf/  See you soon! 
 I'm saving this message, by the way.  Your characterization of Omaha may be worth money someday. 
 Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough input on Fri. 
 Tony, here's another page that has a Gas Quality section. 
 Tony -- here's an excerpt from PG&E's tariff on curtailment of service.    If you are curious about any of the rest of their tariff, see the "Gas Rules" portion of their website at http://www.pge.com/customer_services/business/tariffs/#GR 
 Appoved.  See the attached which has some minor changes. 
 So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you. 
 This document contains both the El Paso and TW information.  I'll bring you the printouts of the relevant El Paso tariff provisions. 
 Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.  Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece fabric and comes in a v-neck style...  I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift certificate idea.  So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble! 
 Transwestern/PNM filing (Docket Nos. RP00-249-000 and RP00-249-001): Technical conference will take place on June 27, 2000, notwithstanding Dynegy's withdrawal of its protest. 
 Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.  If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on Monday morning.  The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so I do not end up with another weekend like the last.  I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, but I'll let you know.  Call if you get lonely!  Love, Sooz 
 Ramona, "total cost commitment" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue to be received from a transaction, taking into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity revenues associated with any minimum throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items aren't applicable in the PNR context; the language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR we would just multiply rate times number of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how this is done if you have an interruptible service with no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the number of days in the contract term.  If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We do not have to offer a right to match. 
 With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away. (It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals this might not be practicable, though.  Further questions...let me know. 
 Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement.  Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues.  I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
 Amazing that TW has not one but TWO people doing this job. Your tree-saving efforts are admirable. 
 Tony, I'd love to see our posting on EnronOnline -- do you know if there's an easy way for us "insiders" to access it? 
 I would expect that Sarah Tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make good on our promise. 
 Something's up with our e-mail, but I did receive it finally.  Thanks. 
 Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.  Comments?  let me know. 
 Kevin -- I've looked at the pooling agreement and I agree with you -- I don't believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement. Any further questions, let me know. 
 If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by about 9:30 and we can talk about it then. 
 Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious.  Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process.  Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the Enrononline process.  Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case. In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  "The Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins."  The only problem is I am not sure we have that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so.  I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write I'd be happy to. 
 Mike, please see the attached, which incorporates the changes we discussed yesterday.  If this looks acceptable to you, please sign two originals and forward them to me.  Thanks.    Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 Houston, TX 77007 (713) 853-0596 
 Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I recall correctly.  Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case FERC does not like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Christine, let me know which is preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m. 
 Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.  I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today. 
 Approved. 
 Christine, this looks fine to me.  Please circulate to the appropriate people for approval with a notation that Appendix or Exhibit whatever provides that the quantity goes to zero during Apr-Oct.  If you need to reach me, I'll be logged in from about 9 to 10 a.m. your time before I go to our hearing here in SF.  Sorry for the late response; it's been a little crazy out here! 
 Tried to print a blank form without success.  Is there any other way I can get one, so I can do some rough drafts of my reviews on my business trip next week.  Please advise. 
 In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here is my 2 cents' worth.  The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  "All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue."  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).  The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.  I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.  Hope this helps.  If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.  My hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234). 
 Received your message.  Do we want to file a response to PNM's protest?  It basically contains the same arguments they launched at our 637 filing, and we did not file an answer to that. 
 Well, I wanted you to have something to open ON your birthday. Greetings from San Francisco! I'm told we're having "earthquake weather" today.  Don't know what that means, but it sounds scary! Hi to K. and G.! 
 Steve, attached for your reading pleasure is the testimony we've filed in the GIR proceeding. 
 Mike, please see the attached.  The first document has Transwestern's revisions highlighted.  If this meets with your approval, please execute two originals and send them to me.  Please call me if you have any questions.    Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 Houston, TX 77007 (713) 853-0596 
 When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, the Commission stated:  The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped.  I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel free to pass this along to your contact at PNM. 
 Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.  Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does "interested parties" mean? parties interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding?).  Page 2:  you state that "individual bid transactions are kept confidential." What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them "sealed bids" on page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.  Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day.  If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).  Page 7:  "an" Capacity Trading Agreement should be "a" Capacity Trading Agreement.  Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future.  Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process. They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating "You must submit a Request for Service prior to making your initial bid" so they don't think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid.  Page 9:  Under "When TW will Respond":  need to specify how notification will be sent.  Page 14:  Column that says "Price" should say "Rate" (for a second there we thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)  Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any questions. 
 Please see the attached in connection with sales of capacity options on TW. 
 Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper).  Here is the language you requested for our posting:  In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges.  If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. 
 On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas in interstate commerce, PNM will "have to either explain how it has appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission."   Lorraine has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the appropriate steps.  I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, let me know. 
 Lynn -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for TW.  This is very much a work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics. We've invited Darrell and Richard to the meeting; if there is anyone else you think we should include just let me know. 
 Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20 going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff= =20 filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that= =20 recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or= =20 2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow= ed=20 to charge market based rates.  The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la= ck=20 of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20 prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20 market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in= =20 TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the= =20 price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20 possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our= =20 system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper= s=20 to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.  Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I= n=20 the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.  ***  To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20 request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20 showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds= =20 all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma= ke=20 the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect. =20 Application for declaratory order must include:  1.

 Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to SF next Tues. thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.  I had thought about going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Boston the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better weekend for me to hang out in Cali.  It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be presented.  I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!  Makes it really hard to plan.  I'll know for sure by the 25th.  Thank goodness for refundable airline tickets.  Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend of June?  And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or Wednesday?  These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses and leave.  Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.  He was in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.  I joined him a few days later in Vegas.  Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.  We set out for Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 66 of course).  Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) and got real dusty and sunburned.  Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and hung out at the South Rim.  Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.    I would really love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the next.  Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul  S. 
 In case you do not have my draft of the filing, here it is. 
 Hi Mum!  I had a fun time this weekend.  It was good to have everyone together.  Glad K&J are relaxing about Mema and the baby.  She gets such a kick out of seeing her.  Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!  Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.  Earlier when I was in a meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 610.  Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.  Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good night's sleep last night.  What a relief.  I have really never had this problem before.  It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down sometime.  Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.  The following week (May 29 - June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have to be there that long.  Have a good afternoon!  Love, Sooz 
 Ashley -- here is a lease renewal letter.  Pumpkin is welcome to stay over at your place.  In fact, if you or Deron need me to check in on her at any time, walk her, etc., you really should not hesitate to call me (713-864-4960)!  I love dogs and wish I could justify having one! 
 I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled IT.  Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported.  Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what you think.  SS 
 Ted, please see if they will agree to Texas law (see last paragraph).  If not, let me know. Otherwise, this looks fine.  SS 
 Please ignore my previous e-mail which included the wrong attachment. 
 Your "courtesy copy" of the draft I sent to MK, Drew and Shelley.  We'll put our heads together and come up with a final version. 
 Here's a draft of a research memo on options.  While I am hopeful that we can overcome FERC's policy on reservation of capacity, our arguments obviously need to be developed a little more before we can do that.  I know the business folks are anxious to hear our strategy.  I would appreciate your comments on the attached. 
 I'll just get with Ramona in the a.m. and see when she can meet & we'll go from there. 
 Noon to 3 our time... 
 Hi Mum!  I'm up for birthday celebration this weekend.  Can you believe I actually have a gift for Jim already?  I'll try to get there as early as I can tomorrow.  Bill will not be coming with me because he has too much work piled up, including clients to visit in jail!  My first priority is sleep as I have not gotten much this week -- I keep waking up in the middle of the night; it's miserable.  To make things worse, I think a ghost has appeared to Goo.  She is really freaked out about something, pacing around and acting like she hears things.  Gabby is her usual self.  How's the pool?  I'll bring my suit just in case...  Love, Sooz 
 Thought you'd be interested in this. 
 Hi Brian!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.  Scott is a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a sweetie!  Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to understand the command "Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on," I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!  I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better. The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch "ER," that is usually what my day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.  Time to hit the tennis courts.  Love, Susan 
 Rich - Dave and I were just discussing whether a period less than 12 months would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg. may bring some changes we want to take advantage of.  It's basically your call:  if SPS were to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a replacement? 
 What if we replace Section 2 with something like "This Agreement shall continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,"  and replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to the intended date of termination."  Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft. 
 P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please let me know. 
 Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me know and I will fax it to you.  In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to handling, and I appreciate your patience.  Susan x30596 
 Hi there!  I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in "View" mode on my Lotus Notes.  What a pretty girl!  I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?  Let me know.  I was thinking of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.  I have no idea what to buy her!  must do some shopping today or tomorrow.  Trivia time:  last night I went to the Astros game with some people from work.  One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.  She likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!  She told me she has a dog called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."  Now you know!  Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.  Love, proud auntie sooz 
 We need to start a new "bucket" file called Direct Testimony.  Then please watch the mail and do a folder for each prepared testimony as they come in. Thank you! 
 Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5. Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.  I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on Sunday a.m.?  Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know. Love, Sooz 
 FYI 
 Bummer.  Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule. Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC.  We hiked down Bright Angel trail to the second rest stop, which was plenty for me.  It was pretty hot. Wish we could have stuck around longer but Bill had to be back for a trial. Talk about restrictive travel schedules. I was thinking about you and Karin and wanting to take your customary nature trips...you know, when Grayson is a little older, we could go on some trips and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else goes hiking/climbing/whatever.  You might have to pay for extra hotel days that way, but at least you would get to go.  In the meantime, what about staying in one place for a week or so -- a beach house, for example.  Eric permitting, I think it would be fun to get everyone together in Florida or Colorado sometime within the next year. My car is ready at the shop.  Yay! Ciao, Sus. 
 Lorraine:  here's Keith's brief response to your question about increasing capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the Gallup compressor.  Let me know where we need to go from here. *** Susan, my understanding is that the capacity west to the California border is a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).  If in any way we try to change the certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.  TW is different than NNG, in that TW certificates capacity rather than facilities. Arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing. Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.  Keith 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 Here is the quick & dirty.  None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are "tested and placed in service."  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin. EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.  Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know. The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss: $25,000/month) The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.  From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to revoke our "in-service" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be triggered. The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was "in service" when we knew it was not. The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption in mind.  Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will be. 
 We do not really have anything that specific, but I could at least point out that the San Juan lateral is fully subscribed. 
 Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if possible. 
 Yes, I will send you a draft shortly. 
 Steve's new idea is to send a letter to Mark asking him to document/explain exactly what his role was in getting this deal.  Comments?  Not sure I care one way or the other, but after I see how it looks in writing, I'll have a better idea of whether this is how we should approach it.  Multi-tasking heavily today.  I'll send you a draft of our PNM answer to Dynegy protest by close of business. 
 Keith, last week you and I discussed briefly Facilities Planning's proposal to change the service factor on the Gallup compressor in order to increase capacity.  I believe you had concluded that a certificate application would be necessary.  Now Arnold Eisenstein is asking me (thru our commercial people) whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the compressor -- in other words, through a pressure commitment.  My initial impression is yes, we would have to make a filing.  Am I out of my mind? Does this make sense?  Please advise. 
 Jeff -- good wrap-up.  May I forward to MKM and Drew? 
 Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.  Our consulting agreement with IGS (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract "identified by IGS" and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while Mark can certainly claim he "identified" the deal, he was not alone in doing so.  Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW. The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value.  If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do decide to take us to court. 
 You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.  The answer is no. If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a column for "Pre-approved Terms" and one for "Non Pre-Approved Terms". Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal Dept's approval.  Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?  As far as I know our marketers have been following this.  I spoke with TK and she is aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any contract that deviates from our standard language.  She has also discussed this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the policy.  If we need to discuss this further please let me know. 
 Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.  There is good precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the attached memo).  Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this. 
 Frank and Steve, see the attached.  My theory, which is based on our experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a gathering company).  Although it seems likely that other pipelines have entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.  Do you agree with my conclusion?  Any other ideas or insights?  Please let me know.  Thanks. 
 Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks. 
 Hey there, enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures!  Just a quick note to say that Bill will be coming with me this weekend, so Mema will have more than enough entertainment.  Tell Jim to bring his tennis gear and if the weather cooperates we can play.  He would probably enjoy hitting with Bill.  Saw Bruce Springsteen last night, even though I'm really not much of a fan. Ann really wanted to go, and I knew it would be a good show (which it was). He played for 3 hours and needless to say I'm pretty worthless this a.m.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  S. 
 Please see the attached.  AA is now unsure about what we should say here (a= s=20 am I).  Can you help?  Thanks. 
 As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000 MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In part, they are alleging that TW is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling. Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT will bump firm shippers.  I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also -- you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a chance... Thanks! Susan (x30596)

 See the attached.  The proceeding certainly isn't over, but I think the parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the Commission will eventually approve, provided the parties present sufficient evidence to support such a decision.  (Unfortunately, we expect the settlement to be protested.)  Direct testimony is due May 5.  To streamline things, the parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by topic.  Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.  I plan to put Mr. Fawcett on as a witness.  Our issue is not particularly controversial anymore, so I do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination; nevertheless, I will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing, which begins May 30. 
 I'm dialling in from home -- got the bug that's going around the office. I'll call you in a few... 
 Glen:  I think this will be fine.  Please add the word "Company" after "Transwestern Pipeline" on the list of parties.  Thanks; we sincerely appreciate your efforts on this settlement.  Susan Scott 
 Glen, I'm faxing you Transwestern's signature page and declaration.  An electronic version of the declaration is attached. 
 Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the best deal.  If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.  Hope this helps! 
 I'm available Tuesday also -- just let me know. 
 you still there? 
 Attached is a draft of the Declaration of Jeffery Fawcett.  If you have comments, please let me know.  Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company susan.scott@enron.com (713) 853-0596 
 pull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that document.  I don't necessarily think it does.  Didn't we basically agree to disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?  HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?  Let's get clarification!!! 
 Rob, Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between SoCalGas and Edison.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended... almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.  Jeff 
 Mark, Susan and I are online in her office if you need to shoot us a quick note. Otherwise, blah, blah, blah...... 
 Rob, This is Jeff.  I'm with Susan in her office listening to the call.  Hey bud, LANDMINE!  Look at the new SoCalGas language respecting the Edison/SDG&E contract in Section 1.9.  Whadaythink?  Write back at this address!  Are you going to raise the issue? 
 Let's plan on Friday before Christmas!  And Craig will join us, I'm sure. Please stay over at my place that night.  That way you would not have to worry about driving all the way back to Tomball after partying downtown -- and we'd get to visit longer! Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office. It is a big drag.  Sheila came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, and had to be hospitalized!  I think I should count myself lucky I only have the office bug.  She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to Austin.  Sounds like she is feeling a lot better. We're having a surprise party for Craig's 40th on Friday!  I don't know whether he suspects anything... Time for more cough medicine! 
 I'm a man trapped in a woman's body... not really, this is Jeff Fawcett in Susan's office.  We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking about the settlement document.  Would you guys pull-up the attached file, "Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"  I think we're OK here, but I don't want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter or that just doesn't make sense.  We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.  Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note saying thumbs up or down?  Thanks a bunch. 
 Hi there!  How's the little buglet doing?  It was good to see you last week, and I feel honored that I got to accompany Grayson on her first restaurant mission.  Hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding schedule to badly.  Got a message from Mema wanting to discuss the baby's bottle habits.  Pu-lease!  If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill at Easter as a distraction.  This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends (aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150.  I'll be driving someone's SUV. If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home.  Do you remember Rob Carty from high school?  I just saw him at a seminar given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers.  He works for Exxon/Mobil now.  I barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!  Thought you would enjoy the following brief excerpt from today's Wall Street Journal:  *** Big Boy's Adventures in Thailand  With his checkered overalls, cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers, Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok.  "People thought he was a little, well, creepy," says Peter Smythe, the head franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare.  "They kept asking me, 'Is he a Chinese Ronald McDonald?'"  Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet. ***  Take care and drop me a line when you can.  Love, Sooz 
 FYI:  This morning, Lorraine and I checked with PNM and surprisingly they do not offer any kind of IT transportation service, just firm service.  So our final revisions to the cover letter do not include acquiring interruptible service from PNM, since it's impossible to do so. 
 Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will for cheap. 
 Drew, I'll fax you the information on the "Be a Spokesmodel...or Just Look Like One" course they offer here in the Houston office. 
 Shelley -- I'm going to the game but should be back in the office after 5 pm today if you want to chat.  x30596. 
 For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.  The three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.  I think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the PHC. 
 Here is the breakdown of 1999 PCB decontamination costs for TW:  Topock mods   $4,675,000 PG&E sample taps  $     90,000 PG&E filter separator  $   600,000 Remove PG&E filter separator $     10,000  If you need the costs broken down in more detail, or need more information, please give me a call at x30596. 
 Do we have an estimate of PCB decontamination costs for 2000?  AA is asking... 
 Aurora, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we will have to do as far as containment of PCBs this year is the subject of some dispute.  I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible. 
 Frazier tells me he's available.  How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on Kirby @ Richmond? 
 Not at all!  Fawcett's the antsy one; he is anxious to use his new honorary law degree (ahem!). I agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a settlement when the agreement has yet to be written.  It would be like giving SoCal a signed blank check (that's carte blancheto us lawyers), and we don't trust them that much. Once we've signed a real agreement, I do want to file something in support. I'm just trying to plan ahead, is all. 
 Brian:  Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the following footnote:  Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary and secondary rights described on Appendix A.  Transwestern does not oppose the other parts of the settlement.  Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company (713) 853-0596 sscott3@enron.com 
 See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think. 
 Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away.  Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous. It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not on a Saturday.  Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri. or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.  Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans are.  Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your fingers crossed!  Love, Sooz 
 Here is a list of all the agreements related to the Gallup Compressor:  1.  Compression Services Agreement (10/18/99) 2.  O&M Agreement (10/18/99) 3.  Gas Conversion Agreement (10/18/99) 4.  Operational Control Agreement (2/11/00) (contains no provisions related to payment) 5.  Letter amendment to Gas Conversion Agreement (2/23/00) (regarding Lock Price) 6.  Amendment to Gas Conversion Agreement (3/24/00) (regarding Start Date and calculation of Estimated CSC Fuel Payment)  If you do not have all of these agreements in your file, or if you know of anyone else who needs a full set of these documents, please let me know and I will send copies immediately.  Also, two letters have been sent pursuant to the terms of the agreements:  1.  Notification by TW to ECS that ECS should pursue an alternative electric supply arrangement (2/29/00) 2.  Approval by TW of interim rate schedule (3/15/00) (w/copy of rate schedule attached)  If you need copies of these letters, let me know and I'll send them to you also.  SS x0596 
 Our answer is simple:  It is not our policy to release such information unless we are required to do so by law, regulation or order. 
 Also, I would add that another reason we didn't submit the O&M agreement is that we considered it to be confidential. 
 Gerald -- here are a couple of suggested wording changes (should appear in blue)  1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over the compressor facilities.  The Operational Control agreement was put into place in Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might unnecessarily complicate the process at that time.  2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in place to accomplish control for TW.  3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate. Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 853-3512. 
 FYi 
 Jeff, here it is.  Take a look and if you have any questions, I'll be prepared to address them promptly so you can send this off. 
 I believe Leslie does regulatory/legal work for ENA on a contract basis. 
 The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board. Thanks. 
 Aurora, my changes appear on the attached. I assume you or AA have updated the numbers for eligible transition costs (second paragraph of section 7).  (If you have not, I'm really not sure who would have those numbers) I updated the numbers for environmental costs in the footnotes.  Please call (x30596) if you have any questions. 
 Attached for your information is a summary of other parties' requests for rehearing of Order 637.  I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. 
 Jeff, here are Colleen's comments.  At your convenience, let's meet to discuss. 
 I'm forwarding the attached as an update.  Am presently researching the issue raised by Drew, and will let you know what I find. 
 Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook  1.  "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.  2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of the party will appear several times in one sentence.  3.  The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."  Example: "Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."  4.  "In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or "concerning."  5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the provision once.  6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.  7.  When in doubt, insert more commas. 
 The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from day to day. The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 months.  If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it. Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it last December. 
 Thanks Dennis.  Do you have the form of discount letter too?  If so, please send it. 
 Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch with her.  I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking. Remember I have water covered.  Call or e-mail if you have questions! 
 Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day. Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several days a week, for sanity's sake.  Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."  It was a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown. (Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.  Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the drum all day.  Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!  Love, Susan 
 See especially pages 5 & 6 of the attached doc., which include the argument that existing ROFR should not be grandfathered.  Please send any comments you have to me.  Thanks!! 
 Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request. A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what happened? I would never ignore you on purpose. I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info. 
 Part I:  Dress Code for Female FERC Lawyers at FERC Proceedings*  Skirts must be mid-calf length and of a synthetic fabric. All clothing worn in FERC hearing rooms must be properly aged (12 years or more). No solid-colored garments are permitted.  Exceptions:  mauve, pink, peach, teal, harvest gold. Hair must be fuzzy, multi-colored and must partially conceal the face. Suntan hose must be worn at all times. Open-toed shoes (preferably in a lighter color than the hem of the skirt) are preferred. Those with a flair for fashion are permitted to wear inexpensive animal print garments, metallic accessories or clothing with fake fur trim, so as to attract attention to one's originality.  *also applicable to female practitioners at the Texas Railroad Commission and Public Utilities Commission. 
 The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
 Here are my comments, spice girl. 
 Something to keep in mind:  Since FERC has implied that it considers shipper support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other pipelines, the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing, the better. 
 Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects.  1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity.  -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers. - Net costs will be separately recorded.  2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the "no tying" part).  3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity.  4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal. - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW.  5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing open access operations?  - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's tariff. - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW's system. - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios.  6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities?  - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently. 
 With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract.  In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract. 
 Hi Ashley!  A couple of things.  First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or the other.  Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean anyway!).  Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund next week.  Merci!  Susan 
 Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before inviting people.  First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:  - imbalance netting & trading - mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators - hourly determination of imbalances  Is this correct?  Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?  As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and I'll get it set up. 
 Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments? Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of? 
 Thanks, Maria, this is very helpful.  I'm planning on drafting something this week for everyone's review.  Don't know if any other pipelines have tried to do anything similar but I'll find out. 
 Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures. She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please let me know if you have any comments in this regard.  One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some intelligence from them. 
 See my changes on the attached. 
 Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.  With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).  On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service.  As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer them. 
 As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion, Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will ha
