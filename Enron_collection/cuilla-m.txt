 don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure). didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what the fuck. 
 Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding. 
 I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding. The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.

 Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient. Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island.  The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out.  When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.  According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.  In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation."  Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants.  Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer.  In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people."  The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.  Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.  Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles.  The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

 I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  Thanks,   Martin Cuilla 
 I sent an email to the prez of Star about the furniture and cancelled our purchase from Furniture USA.  The said we should get a cedit on our credit card in 5 days.  Hopefully I will hear from him soon and we will have spankin' new furniture!

 Kayvan,  Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if Enron isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks,  Martin 
 Mike,  Please call me if you have any questions or opportunities  Thanks,  Martin Cuilla

 Doesn't make a lot of sense.  We don't have any offices in Dallas that I am aware of and his name or anything closely resembling it is not in our employee listings.

 These are last years rules so the might change a little!

 Have my options and restricted stock been set yet? 
 you know i am torn - I took OU against A&M at minus 17 but that was in OK.  Sagarin actually has the line at 5 which is a bit of a surprise and the game is in Lubbock.  Not sure if I am going to bet it or not 
 yeah i got yelled at also.  i tried to say i wasn't that drunk but z wasn't having any of that conversation.  she told me that after friday and saturday she felt i was slowly regressing.  then i told her i felt i should be able to screw missy just once.  she said that was ok.
