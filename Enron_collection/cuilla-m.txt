 don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure). didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what the fuck. 
 Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look at some options when you are here for the wedding. 
 I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding. The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.

 Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient. Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand. Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works. Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house. 
 The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.

You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone. If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 (cell) and we will work it out.

 Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score). 
 I am interested in purchasing a Huglu shotgun and would like to get a price. I am looking at the Model Au1 semi-automatic model.

 Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55  Dec 00          Mar 01    This Year - Dec 00     Next Year Dec 01  Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago	 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60	0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59	2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14	 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97	9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%

 Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already). Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me know.  Love  Hubby
