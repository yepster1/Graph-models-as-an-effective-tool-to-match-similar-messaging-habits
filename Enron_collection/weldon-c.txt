 thanks 
 yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to fork out the $60 to take my family now, versus $15 and being less crowded.

 Suzette,  Monday morning should work.  Just give me a call.  I'm tied up in the p.m. but a.m. should work.  Charlie 
 2%! 
 I'm not sure.  WE're going to the Astros tonight and are working on the nursery I think.  Other than that, not much 
 Here are the updated curves as of last nights close.  Let me know if you need anything else.   Charlie 
 Same as before except changed cob date to 4/27 instead of 4/24 on quote sheet.

 Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum. The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)  Thanks,  Charlie 
 The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)  1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.  2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:    MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk May	22,300	0	22,300	0 June	22,300	0	22,300	0 July	22,300	0	22,300	0 August	22,300	0	22,300	0 September	22,300	0	22,300	0   NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.  3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.  4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)  5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.  6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:       MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0 November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412 December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112 January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460 February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690 March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690 April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0   NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.  7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo. 
 We'll be there Friday night and plan to spend the night.  If Elizabeth would rather spend the night with her friend, that's fine.  Hunter can play with Travis that night and be plenty happy.  Love,  Charlie

 Matt,  Would you please make sure that David gets to see this tomorrow.  Mark asked me to send this so you could print it out and have Dave look at it and then recommend would else ought to see it.  Would you plese E-mail me or call me with a list of who else needs to see this sometime tomorrow, per Mark.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 Enron Avg = 90 injected Industry avg = 86 injected I-Bank Avg = ~72 injected (they should stick to banking)  My number is 88.  I think the market has already built in a 90 or less number. 
 I just deleted a bunch.  LEt me know if I need to do anymore. 
 We should make it by 6:45 plus or minus 30 minutes 
 103! 
 Why are energy stocks down so much today?  My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price. 
 We are planning on bringing Flossie if that's OK. 
 Great.  Flossie is a Maxine, not a Max 
 Suzette,  I was able to fill out an evaluation form on Tuesday and submit it by E-mail.  Hopefully they will accept it OK. It was nice meeting you and I wish you good luck in the admissions process.   Sincerely,  Charlie

 Attached in Bold are the answers to all the questions except 6 and 8.  The major outstanding issue as of right now is the final determination of specs for the fuel oil from Mitsubishi.. 
 FYI - I'm looking into this.  Could be my ticket but there are a few issues I have to resolve. 
 The curves in this file were off by a month since April is no longer valid.  See the attached file for the correct prices and months.  Charlie 
 Karen,  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon.  I look forward to hearing from you.   Sincerely,  Charlie Weldon 
 We enjoyed ourselves and are glad that we were able to visit.  We're looking forward to you coming to our house in a few weeks  Love,  Charlie 
 PAth to deal Status is O:\NAES\NATTS\ADM\Deal Status 
 thanks! 
 Karen,  I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.  I just noticed that I  replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.  I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.   Thanks,  Charlie

 Soma,  Per your request, I've calculated a Houston Area notional swap price for 6/01 through 12/04.  I used  the IF-Katy mid curve as of today's close and have not adjusted for any injection or withdrawal charges that may need to be accounted for in your analysis.  If you need any further help, please let me know.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Doug,  Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida. As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.  We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.  Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Matt,  Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.  Thanks again for all your help.  Charlie 
 Mike,  I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.  I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.  He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Doug,  Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.  I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Here's another good article:  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&siteid=yhoo&dist=yhoo&guid=%7B9B97CB0D%2D87BD%2D41C6%2D8E80%2DF23F0722052C%7D

 Guys,,  I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.  How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?   Thanks,  Charlie 
 B2B = business to business, usually referring to on-line (Internet-based) electronic commerce (e-commerce).  B2C = business -to-consumer  C2C = consumer-to-consumer 
 Is this guy short ENE or what?  He has a couple of decent points about our "fuzzy" math. but we won't miss earnings, guaranteed, for at least a couple quarters. 
 Thanks for the info! 
 Bill,  I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.  Thanks!  Charlie Weldon 
 I'll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny. 
 Doug,  Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.   Thanks again,  Charlie 
 Our "spec" is <.05 ppm.  I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.  We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.  I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.  The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.  Charlie 
 Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10)  Note the volatility in these that I graphed.  This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.  Charlie 
 Kim,  The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.  Let me know if you need any more assistance.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Thanks Doug,  Can you confirm (or tell me how I can)  that these sample charge are being routed to Co#0413, RC#106230 per my previous note. 
 Glad to hear Buddy is getting better.  I assume we still need rain but are doing OK given the good rain 2 weeks ago.  We may come this weekend or next.  Will know tonight. 
 Eric and I will come by ~4:00.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 Loftus,  I've been meaning to contact you forever and I just ran across your e-mail address from our incoming Associate class list.  Sorry it took so long.  How the heck are you doing?  I'd like to hear if you have another job yet or what your prospects are.  Please give me a call when you can.  My number is 713-853-3088.  Hope all is well.   Sincerely,  Charlie 
 As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000.  Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Mike,  The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Matt,  Doug Leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for Ft. Pierce.  I believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow.  In order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved, I am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning.  Please let me know what your availability is.   Thanks!  Charlie 
 got it 
 Go it 
 Matt,  Two quick questions that Doug Leach needs answered ASAP to get the oil ordered:  1)  Name and number of contact person for handling the accounting/paperwork type issues at HD King plant.  2)  Name and number of contact person for logistic/scheduling issues at HD King plant.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Got it 
 Thanks Mike.  Would you mind providing the MW and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Doug,  The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Just want to remind everyone that the exact quantity is 202,000 gallons, isn't that right David? 
 Steve,  As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.  The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is  ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.  Let me know if you need anything else.   Charlie 
 Thank you Doug!  Sorry this thing turned into such a mess along the way.  I appreciate the help you have given both me and the team.  Charlie 
 David,  Attached is a summary calculation of the net payment owed FPUA for the fuel oil transaction.  Please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Todd,  Attached is my resume per our conversation.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 I want to remain a member 
 Dutch,  Here's the quote sheet starting in August.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 FYI...... (and I'll provide the update he is requesting) 
 Are you staying? 
 Ed,  I'm interested in taking this course as I've heard it was pretty good.  I have applied to take it within the training system and it should be queued up for your approval if you support me taking it.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 John,  Thanks for the upate.  Sorry to hear this deal has been further delayed.  The updated gas price is 4.625 as of last night's curves.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 FYI...and thanks again! 
 FYI - There's also an opening on the Texas Gas Desk that may give me the opportunity to short-circuit the "required" rotations.  We'll see. 
 Slight problem,  can't get the room in 3 Allen center b/c they turn down the A/C on the weekend and need a cost code to cover any desired cooling.  Hence, we will likely end up in the Enron building in a less nice room but we'll manage.  VCW 
 June settled at 3.738.   No pressure to pay but wanted to document.  Later.... 
 Chris,  Attached are the prices you requested.  Please let me know if I can help you in any way, as we discussed.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Cool.  I'll set up a payment plan if you wish, with competitive rates.  :-) 
 Gracias 
 Attaached are the notional bids you requested.  Please contact me or Eric if you have any querstions .   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 MArk asked me to FW this to you 
 John,  Ignore the last message.  Kelli Little is going to look at your deal... 
 Rain is good.  I think Travis is coming to our house for a few days also.  Enron stock is a long story but we'll just all have to be patient.  I've been swamped.  Call you when I'm on the bus 
 Let's shoot for lunch next Tuesday.  Would one of you please contact me that a.m. to see how the day is going.  It's been pretty hectic lately but I think we will be able to do it.  Thanks,  Charlie

 Team,  We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".  In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".  The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search  Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.  A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 I'll click the ad from home.  Your newsletter is massively jumbled on my Outlook here at work.  not sure why.  Congrats on the IFR rating. 
 Glad to hear Buddy is getting better.  I assume we still need rain but are doing OK given the good rain 2 weeks ago.  We may come this weekend or next.  Will know tonight.

 I'd still like to play tennis sometime.  I don't have the time nor the money to play much golf.  Speaking of golf and your predictions, would you like to wager on your goal of 70's by Dec '02.  I'll bet you right now at $10 a stroke over/under 80 on a reasonable course (par 72 etc)  of your choice in Houston next December.   :-)  Charlie (future Dynegy employee, hopefully)

 Thanks.  That's a big cell but it's gonns miss us by 20 miles. 
 That should work for me.  Sorry for the late response but we had talked about it I guess. 
 I'm at EB3212E for now.  MOving to new building on Nov. 9th.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 Kim,  The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.  Let me know if you need any more assistance.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Took 4 hours vacation on Friday, October 12th.  I think my assistant is putting them in though.

 Indeed.  Same for ya'll after the first drive.  Watch out for Derek Farmer.  That kid can play.  True frosh starts and runs for 100 against a fairly stout defensive front 7.  I guess yall's season comes down to next saturday.  If you can land any broker tickets or otherewise for the UT/A&M game, please let me know.  VCW 
 Intersting points.  I basically agree with him 
 Very cool.  Did you get my e-mail about the game and Sat night?

 Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10)  Note the volatility in these that I graphed.  This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.  Charlie 
 The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.  Charlie 
 Our "spec" is <.05 ppm.  I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.  We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.  I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.  The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.  Thanks,  Charlie 
 Doug,  Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.   Thanks again,  Charlie 
 I'll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny. 
 One G2 was 10.5.  Other was ~9.5.  G3's were 7.5 ish, maybe 8.  I thought it was a pretty good deer.  He would have been really good next year but we've let so many go like that not to ever see them again... , I'm really glad he got this one to break his 7 year drought.  This was his 8th season. 
 Bill,  I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.  Thanks!  Charlie Weldon 
 Doug,  This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).  Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.   Charlie 
 Thanks for the info! 
 Is this guy short ENE or what?  He has a couple of decent points about our "fuzzy" math. but we won't miss earnings, guaranteed, for at least a couple quarters.

 Guys,,  I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.  How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?   Thanks,  Charlie

 John,  Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous quotes, the new updated notionl bid is $4.51/MMBTU.  Let me know if you need any more assistnace.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Here's another good article:  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&siteid=yhoo&dist=yhoo&guid=%7B9B97CB0D%2D87BD%2D41C6%2D8E80%2DF23F0722052C%7D 
 Doug,  Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.  I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 Mike,  I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.  I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.  He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Matt,  Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.  Thanks again for all your help.  Charlie 
 Doug,  Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida. As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.  We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.  Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon 
 Soma,  Per your request, I've calculated a Houston Area notional swap price for 6/01 through 12/04.  I used  the IF-Katy mid curve as of today's close and have not adjusted for any injection or withdrawal charges that may need to be accounted for in your analysis.  If you need any further help, please let me know.   Thanks,  Charlie Weldon

 Karen,  I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.  I just noticed that I  replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.  I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.   Thanks,  Charlie 
 thanks! 
 PAth to deal Status is O:\NAES\NATTS\ADM\Deal Status 
 We enjoyed ourselves and are glad that we were able to visit.  We're looking forward to you coming to our house in a few weeks  Love,  Charlie 
 Karen,  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon.  I look forward to hearing from you.   Sincerely,  Charlie Weldon 
 FYI - I'm looking into this.  Could be my ticket but there are a few issues I have to resolve. 
 Attached in Bold are the answers to all the questions except 6 and 8.  The major outstanding issue as of right now is the final determination of specs for the fuel oil from Mitsubishi..

 Suzette,  I was able to fill out an evaluation form on Tuesday and submit it by E-mail.  Hopefully they will accept it OK. It was nice meeting you and I wish you good luck in the admissions process.   Sincerely,  Charlie 
 Great.  Flossie is a Maxine, not a Max 
 We are planning on bringing Flossie if that's OK. 
 Why are energy stocks down so much today?  My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price. 
 103! 
 We should make it by 6:45 plus or minus 30 minutes 
 Sounds like fun.  I got my offer from UBS Friday and turned it in today, signed.  The judge approved the deal Friday also so if nothing gets screwed up in the next few weeks then I should have a new employer (when the deal closes)  Have fun,  Charlie 
 I just deleted a bunch.  LEt me know if I need to do anymore. 
 Enron Avg = 90 injected Industry avg = 86 injected I-Bank Avg = ~72 injected (they should stick to banking)  My number is 88.  I think the market has already built in a 90 or less number. 
 Matt,  Would you please make sure that David gets to see this tomorrow.  Mark asked me to send this so you could print it out and have Dave look at it and then recommend would else ought to see it.  Would you plese E-mail me or call me with a list of who else needs to see this sometime tomorrow, per Mark.  Thanks,  Charlie

 The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)  1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.  2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:    MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk May	22,300	0	22,300	0 June	22,300	0	22,300	0 July	22,300	0	22,300	0 August	22,300	0	22,300	0 September	22,300	0	22,300	0   NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.  3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.  4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)  5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.  6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:       MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0 November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412 December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112 January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460 February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690 March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690 April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0   NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.  7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo. 
 Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum. The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)  Thanks,  Charlie 
 Same as before except changed cob date to 4/27 instead of 4/24 on quote sheet. 
 I'm not sure.  WE're going to the Astros tonight and are working on the nursery I think.  Other than that, not much 
 Do you have his home phone # ?  Thanks!  Charlie 
 2%! 
 Suzette,  Monday morning should work.  Just give me a call.  I'm tied up in the p.m. but a.m. should work.  Charlie 
 yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to fork out the $60 to take my family now, versus $15 and being less crowded. 
 thanks 
 My supervisor is Ed Mc Michael. 
 Eric and I will come by ~4:00.  Thanks,  Charlie
