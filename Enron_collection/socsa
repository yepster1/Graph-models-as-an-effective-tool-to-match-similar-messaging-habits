There are clearly a lot of empty boxes used in that setup, and I doubt Target employees are emptying out boxes of soda for stuff like this.  
  
In fact, I know they aren't because I know that the coke reps come through and do this sort of thing all the time.  They even have templates and kits with step by step instructions, just like a lego kit.  It's absolutely NOT done by retail employees in most cases.  You "local target" just had enough room for the setups, and the managers agreed to let the coke reps do it.Right, which is how you know this was set up by coke corporate, not local employees.  Target isn't going to empty out 30 boxes of perfectly good soda for this.  Why did you submit this as a self post?  Please delete and re-submit as a link post.  Thanks!Thank you for your submission!

How can it be an issue of illegal search and seizure if the individuals are choosing to be in an area which is under surveillance?  I'm not saying I agree with the law, and I think it's sort of a solution in search of a problem, but not everything is a constitutional issue, and I seriously doubt this is.  &gt;The vast majority do not, either in volume, or by degree of support.

This is ridiculous hyperbole unless you interpret support for any gun control legislation as "not supporting gun rights."  Only people who are unwilling to even engage in an earnest debate over the role of firearms in our culture would approach the debate in such black and white terms.  

In reality, if you ask things like "should all guns be banned" then you will find very low levels of support among liberals - who tend to take a much more nuanced approach to the issue than that.  That's the rub here - on one side you have people who want to take a pragmatic approach to gun rights versus public safety, and on the other side, you basically have a large population of individuals who take exception to *any* limitation on their ability to own cool grownup toys.  These are the ones who see "liberals support a registry" and take that to mean "liberals are anti-gun rights."  Which is, at best, a gross oversimplification of a complex topic.  
  
But that's the entire strategy isn't it?  By dragging the quality of discourse down to this level, it effectively prevents any meaningful debate from happening at all. When has the US ever disarmed it's citizens? 
  
This was not a widespread thing though, even in that situation.  Either way, the courts sided with the residents, and police were ordered to return the weapons.  That's about the least sinister example of gun confiscation possible, and is pretty far removed from the narrative that liberals support gun confiscation policies nationwide.&gt; Additionally, chargers have more failsafe and are built/tested for charging

I don't know if that's really a valid assumption.  In both cases, it's just an OTS lithium battery charge controller being used (in different packaging), so I don't understand why we would assume that the $20 charger has a higher quality controller than the $80 mod.  
  
The circuitry in both is "built/tested for charging" - what else would it be built and tested to do?  Do people really think it's some random Kanger engineer drawing a CAD model and then immediately sending it into production?  That's ridiculous.  I guarantee you that Kanger is verifying and testing their designs at least as rigorously as the Chinese company making cheap wall chargers.   
  
Honestly, I've seen this sentiment repeated so many times, and I really wonder what evidence it is based on, because it makes no sense to me as an EE.Do you have any idea how paranoid this sounds?  What "thousand cuts" are you talking about?  What recent legislation has been debated which gives you this impression?  
  
This is exactly what I am talking about - you refuse to even acknowledge reality here, so how can this discussion even proceed?  The US has far and away the most permissive gun culture in the developed world, yet here you are, jumping at shadows at noon in the middle of the desert.  None of what you said is even close to being implemented into law in the US.  Most people are talking about universal background checks and *maybe* a registry in some cases.  
  
Either way - I don't necessarily support bans on reasonable magazine sizes, but I am still curious what is it which gets people so worked up about this?  Is there a practical reason you need 30 round magazines?  Are you planning to lay down covering fire during a home invasion or something?  This is a perfect example of paranoid hyperbole which completely derails the conversation.  From my point of view, the only practical reason to have a 30 round magazine is military and police style engagements.  It does nothing for (realistic) self defense, hunting or sport shooting.  
  
This is where the nuance comes in.  While I don't really think they have a practical purpose in your average civilians arsenal, that doesn't mean I think they should be illegal.  That's a debate I am willing to have, but here, you have started out as if this is the most absurd premise imaginable.  As if someone has told you that you can only have your happy meal toy in pink, or something.  
  
&gt;They say they don't want to take our guns then demand then one at a time until nothing is left.  
  
This will never happen unless the current government collapses and the US becomes a failed state.  It is literally right there in the constitution.  Nobody is going to take your guns away.I'll disagree with the "prevailing wisdom" here.  As far as I know, there is no evidence or reason to think that the built in charger is any lower quality, or entails any more risk than a dedicated wall charger.  In both cases, it's just an off-the-shelf charge controller slapped into a different form factor.  I don't know why the mod charger would be any lower quality than the wall charger.  In fact, I'd sort of expect that a high-quality pass-through mod probably has a somewhat more advanced controller than the wall charger does.I'm discussing this on a national level specifically.  Either way, my points still remain - we are begging the question about the broader utility of large magazines.  &gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3n4pw9/active_shooter_reported_at_oregon_college/  
  
How about a gentleman's wager?  I bet you that the person here was apprehended while reloading, or when his feed jammed during a hasty, forceful reload.  
  
Whether you want to admit it or not, this actually seems to be a common trend in mass shootings - reloading renders the shooter vulnerable for at least a few seconds.  Lots of these shootings end when the criminal is attempting to reload.Indeed.  Clearly, guns are not part of the problem here.  Not even a little.Yeah, it's too bad a bunch of people didn't start a shootout on a college campus.  There's no way that could have possibly made the situation worse or more confusing.  I can find you lots of shootings which happened in lots of places which allowed concealed carry.  
  
http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/24/there-have-been-204-mass-shootings-and-204-days-in-2015-so-far/The majority of shootings do not happen in gun-free zones.It's partially the number of guns, and partially the fanatical, cavalier attitude we have towards them.  In a place like Switzerland, the issue can actually be discussed rationally by adults as the gravely serious issue it is.  In the US, we can't even have a debate at all, because the prevailing narrative on one side of the aisle is to immediately make the issue black and white in order to remove any semblance of nuance from the discussion.  
  
 "Another shooting in a gun-free zone,"  They will say dismissively, rolling their eyes.  As if sarcasm is a productive approach to understanding this complicated sociological issue, which seems deeply rooted in American culture.  
  
It's not complicated though.  It's exactly this level of discourse which precludes any remedy to the problem.  Which is exactly how they want it, because they refuse to even acknowledge that there is a problem in the first place -  "Well, it could never happen me, because I have lots of guns."  Right?  "If these victims had the same number of guns I do, they would all still be alive!"  Exactly.Yeah, but then the same libertarians will  dismissively roll their eyes at the "war on crime," call it government waste, and go back to insisting that everyone would be safer if everyone was armed all the time.  It's a very bizarre utopia they have, where they are constantly looking over your shoulder, living under the threat of being shot in a world where everyone is armed. 
  
The issue can be multi-faceted.  The wide proliferation and availability of guns is definitely part of the problem. There is so much epidemiological evidence supporting this, it's like trying to claim that cigarettes don't cause cancer in 2015.Because that would require a registry, and we all know what that means.  You start with a registry, and before you know it, you wake up one day and you've killed 6 million Jews. 

If only there was some way we could implement these laws *without* committing genocide.  Whoever figures that one out will probably win a Nobel prize.I blame Ellen Pao.Wow.  Fascinating.  But surely that means citizens are being randomly dragged out out of their homes so jackbooted thugs can take their weapons?  If not, they are probably living in fear of their own government, at the very least, right?  
  
I mean, how do Canadians fight of entire platoons of highly armed criminals who *really* want that new television, if they don't all have an entire unregistered arsenal of semi-automatic rifles with 60 round magazines and 10,000 rounds of Ammo?  
  
Living in Canada must be terrifying. Hey, great example!

I have not heard any serious mainstream politician in the US discuss banning guns outright.  For good reasons - that could literally never happen unless the US constitution was amended.  That makes -
  
&gt;BAN GUNS OH MY GOD  
  
\- a strawman.  On the other hand, I see frequent attempts to engage the pro-gun community on topics like background checks and registries.  Attempts which are not reciprocated, to put it kindly.  
  
&gt;will do little to nothing about actual gun violence  
  
Because these small things are the absolute limit in terms of what is possible given the aforementioned political climate.  The entire debate get steered in the direction of such symbolic legislation, and then the pro-gun folks say "see, gun control laws are meaningless and shallow" while ferociously opposing any legislation that might actually go far enough as to accomplish something.  It's called "poisoning the well."This is why I don't want kids.  I want to grow old and cynical so I can enjoy watching humanity destroy itself, without the guilt that I contributed to the suffering by bringing more irrational, violent apes into the world.  &gt;..is a gun still bad  
  
Nobody is saying guns are bad.  People are saying that statistically, their widespread proliferation causes problems.  It's a bit more complicated than "good vs bad."
  
&gt;pressure cooker.  
  
Honestly?  If given the option between a professionally engineered firearm, and an amateur pressure cooker bomb, I'd take the bomb.  I mean, there's a decent chance of would-be murderers blowing themselves up before they can harm anyone that way.  Tsarnaev bros would have likely killed more than three people just by opening fire into the crowd.  Now, if they were smart about it, they would have gone with beer kegs instead.  But that's the point - only an idiot would even try something like that.

Now you're getting somewhere!  Try to think of the reasons why this never happens, but gun violence is so common.  
  
&gt;Cigarettes cause cancer  
  
And based on the science which tells us this, we have passed strict laws to ensure that smoking is a personal choice which will not harm others who choose not to smoke.  So once again, why have we not taken the exact same actions with guns, given that we have very similar evidence?  
  
&gt;It requires a deliberate act and intent to make it shoot.  
  
Exactly.  It's far and away the easiest way for you average Joe to kill someone.  Which is why it should be strictly regulated.&gt; whole subsections of guns outright

Indeed.  But not all guns.  You can't own RPGs either.  That's a whole class of weapons right there.  
  
&gt;There is also the issue of many people not really trusting the government to stop at "common sense". The whole give an inch and they will take a mile mindset is very involved with this whole mess. Sadly this means nothing gets anywhere.

He was exactly the sort of person you'd imagine - an insufferable bandwagon, "anti-everything-you-like" douche.  I have no idea what the appeal was.  
  
I gave them His and Hers replica jerseys for a wedding gift.I mean, yeah - it's completely understandable.  I wouldn't want to be wandering around in an unfamiliar city I've never been to before, that late at night either. Can you explain to me exactly what everyone means by "mental health"  here?  Specifically,what is the high level plan for fixing the alleged problem is?
  
Do you mean you plan to throw public funding at a comprehensive universal mental healthcare system?  Because I'm all for that.  But you'll have to excuse my skepticism of such a narrative when it is coming from a party which has repeatedly stated that they intend to dismantle all social welfare entirely, and are vehemently opposed to any kind of public spending.  In that context, you'll understand why this comes off as cynical lip service.Literally all of the Norway deaths come from that one incident.  That's an incredibly misleading chart.  Norway has had exactly one such incident from 2009-2013.  It was just a really bad one.  If you are trying to claim that the problem is worse in Norway than the US, then you are being quite disingenuous.
  
You are never going to find a way to stop people from killing each other.  The entire issue with easily available guns is that it makes is incredibly simple and efficient to act on the violent tendencies some humans possess.    
  
The real issue is that one side refuses to even discuss the possibility of universal background checks and registries.  There is no conversation about these issues because one side puts an enormous amount of effort and money towards keeping it that way.  It's all about the context of those statistics.  No, one chart doesn't explain the entire story, but as part of the larger narrative, that particular chart is completely ridiculous.  If there was a serious hypothesis that Norway has worse gun violence then the US, which was broadly supported by other evidence, then it would be pertinent, but nobody is seriously entertaining that idea over one incident.  People in the US are alarmed at the frequency of mass shootings, not the magnitude of one incident.  
  
Nobody is up in arms because the US had one horrific shooting incident in the past 5 years which accounted for all gun deaths in that time.  People are up in arms over the frequency of these incidents in the US, which has eclipsed [1 per day in 2015](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/01/2015-274-days-294-mass-shootings-hundreds-dead/)http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/01/2015-274-days-294-mass-shootings-hundreds-dead/The millennial generation is bigger than the baby boom generation.  
  
The issue is partially that the boomers with the best jobs are sitting on them as long as they can, making it difficult for the millennials to catch up.  White collar work can usually be done well into one's 60's so why wouldn't the boomers keep earning those paychecks if they can?So you are seriously going to go with the argument that Norway has a worse gun violence problem than the US?  
  
I wish you the best of luck with that.  Seriously, since that message is ridiculous, and discredits your position.  So you agree that the US clearly has a worse gun violence problem than Norway?Read the edit.  Clearly a typo.OK, well please keep pushing that narrative then.  It's a good one.  Really, you've changed my mind on the matter and I now think Norway is more violent than the US.

There is a large number of people who honestly look at these horrific incidents, and the way they comfort themselves is to say "this would never happen to me, because I have guns.". In some cases they are right, and in some cases they are wrong, but the problem is that they then project that sentiment much more broadly than it realistically applies. The issue becomes one dimensional for them, because the other proposed solutions essentially peal away at their own coping mechanisms. Wow, so brave OP.  The kid was 12 years old.  That's what engineering is to 12 year olds.  I'd like to see you, as a grown man, do something less "trivial."  
  
Lol, the neckbeard is strong in this thread. Did you really think a 12 year old wrote 8 segment display drivers?This was not his only project.  Exactly this.  I was doing the same shit when I was 13.  Taking shit apart and mostly failing to put it back together. Now I am an engineer. This entire thread is an incredibly bizzare form of neckbeardery.  We should absolutely be encouraging this stuff, not ridiculing it.  
  
These are the same people who will sit there and condemn the US for falling behind the rest of the world in scinece and engineering, yet we mock a 12 year old for not writing display drivers.

It's still there...  Also, MS is "Master of Science," not Ms. Socsa haha.Says you?  It seems like the people at MIT disagree with you.  Now I'm confused though... Are people at MIT idiots or brilliant?  Why should I care about scholarships to a school filled with alleged idiots?
  
  I'm guessing the offer is contingent on him meeting the admissions criteria in high school anyway.  If there are more deserving candidates, and he proves to be a disappointment in high school, it will be a moot point.  
  
FYI - my MS is from MIT, and I donate to the school.  I fully support the decision, though I appreciate your input.I am absolutely floored at the level of neckbeard in this thread.Right, just like how the first time I got contact lenses in middle school, I pretended that I had to put drops in them all the time so people in class would see me do it and know I had contact lenses.  That's the sort of dumb awkward shit kids do.  He wanted attention, maybe, but he's not Lex Luthor.  He's a dumb kid.  
  
I have no interest in giving thedailybeast clickbait page views.  "Nerds" are raging because we see the utter technical illiteracy in this country and it terrifies us.  The speed and brutality with which the conservative media moved to smear the encouragement this kid was getting is disgusting.  One minute reddit is going off about how "lel DAE terrorists win, liberty vs security?" and the next minute were back to "oh well, it looks like a bomb and were just arresting 14 year olds because freedom.  Clearly just an abundance of caution."  Pardon me if this smells like partisan nonsense.What are you talking about?  My comment is right there.  I made a small edit.  Not sure if reddit is weird or what....OK?  I clicked edit.  Not sure what you mean.Profanity is sure helping your otherwise well reasoned conspiracy theories.  The comment is still there.  I really have no idea what you are on about.  
  
Come at me bro.  Ask me engineering questions if you don't believe me.  &gt;My 5 year old niece...
  
Neckbeard is "let's all circlejerk about how we are all smarter than a 14 year old."What?  Is this another conspiracy theory?  I'm pretty sure downvotes from your profile page don't register to anyone but the person doing it anyway.  Sounds like you are projecting.&gt;People like you are exactly what's wrong with the world.  
  
Yes because I disagree with you.  At least it's nice to know I'm making an impact.Even more powerful engineer?Yeah, weird shit happens.  Getting this worked up about it is ridiculous.  People thought that throwing a kid in cuffs was idiotic, so they encouraged him on social media and it went viral.  Get over it.  There are far more important things to get worked up over. Dat free fall tho.It clearly looks like a shitty drainage ditch which would destroy road wheels.  Impatient OP clearly highlighted it to obfuscate this fact I find that most people who complain about cyclists are usually pretty obnoxious.OP clearly put the pink part in to hide the drain.It's the traditional PhD defense offering.  Little know fact.  I've seen dozens of these things, and this one is extremely high quality.This song is about me!How much does he know about bird law?I feel you bro.  I got my first hangnail the other day at age 30.  Fucking aging man.  
&gt;As I said further up, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. 
  
Could have fooled me.This is not peasantry free.  There is a peasant stick right there in the foreground.I am extremely passionate about how the [serious] tag is the cancer killing reddit.&gt;Master of NeckbeardThe entire Christian religion and most of the historical dogma comes from a place of persecution.  It's no surprise that this sentiment continues despite Christians being an overwhelming majority in western culture.I can only change my coverage when I renew it every year.  Though I guess there would be nothing stopping me from taking out a second policy.AHoly shit.  I have family in Saluda.  Are the evacuating?Looks like they are evacuating within a quarter mile of the river so downtown Saluda is probably fine (and anyone not right on the river.)
  
http://m.wistv.com/wistv/db_344974/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=YHrnLbmlAre those good teams?&gt;toprightnews.com(In laws) Hah... I'll just ask the wife when she gets home.A lot of the heaviest rain in VA was in the mountains along the I-81 corridor.  Elevation is around 2000' in much of the area, so rivers rose and a few roads flooded, but nothing like this since there are not extensive flood plains like there are in the low country.  Mudslides are a bit of a concern, but it's pretty rocky on the slopes for the most part, so even that is limited.  
  
I keep saying it, but Appalachia is like the one spot in the country which seems somewhat immune to dangerous weather and wildlife.  It's South Carolina, so I fully expect pictures of 4 wheelers converted into jet skis.  That coffin is extremely clean.  I'd wager it was never buried.OP said the roads were shit.  Seems like that would be a better use of public resources than bored cops.  
  
Hey, I think we're onto something.  Maybe have cops do a construction rotation to keep them in shape?Drug dealers are stupid and paranoid.  It makes for an interesting conversation.Driving through flowing water on flat asphalt is just asking to get swept away.  Especially if you have big floaty tires like on a jeep.  It's one thing on a trail, where you are driving through puddles and rocky fords, but on asphalt it doesn't take a lot to "float" the car away since you have very homogeneous flow and no rocks to "grab" onto when you hit the gas.  Also, you can't just get out of the vehicle to anchor a winch, or you will probably get [Nedry'd](http://cdn.gifbay.com/2015/04/nedry_slip-172757.gif).
  
The massive heavy rims and low profile tires are also helping this guy out by limiting buoyancy.  He's probably better off than a jeep or truck in many ways here (though it's still not safe and I wouldn't do it unless it was an emergency).  I mean, what do you expect when you keep drafting players like Johnny Manziel who have more personality than NFL upside?  You guys are never going to win with your current front office.  This is why it's so nice having my own office.  Nobody gives a shit if I make clouds inside as long as they don't smell anything and I'm not being obnoxious about it.  &gt;Bro, what do you mean you only go through 5ml a day?  Get on my level scrub - $15/day in juice or GTFO.It was probably about 3-4 years ago when the KR808 cigalike models were first getting popular.  I was importing them wholesale from Alibaba and selling them to gas stations and head shops in town.  My entire marketing strategy was sitting on campus and in bars blowing clouds.  I got so much positive attention back then.  People were genuinly interested in WTF I was doing.  It's sort of fascinating to see how things have swung the other direction in the past few years.I have issues with the super thick juice and the vertical 0.5 coils.  I really have to "prime" the coil by doing a few short pulses to warm up the juice before it will wick properly, or I will get semi-dry hits.  
  
What's frustrating with my subtank mini is that I can't vape it all the way to the bottom efficiently, and it always seems like the last few mL have gotten really thick, like the PG gets wicked and the VG parts do not.  Over time, this gets worse and worse until I actually empty the tank, which feels like a bit of a waste.Windows?  I blow the occasional cloud when the door is closed, but I generally hold it in for minimal visibility and smell when it is open.  Luckily, for whatever reason, I sit near all the administrative people who are always talking all day, so I have an excuse to keep my door closed.&gt; The D is gonna get its shit together

I really hate to be that guy, but a lot of this seems to depends on which group of refs show up.  If we get a group who keeps the defensive holding flags on a 3 second timer, we are fucked, because we don't have an elite pass rush without Sizzle.  If we get a group which actually lets the secondary breathe on the receivers, we might be OK since we seem to do alright in man coverage as long as the flags stay put.  
  
That's what pissed me off the most in the Bengals game.  We had like 3 or 4 times where ticky tack holding flags on third down kept their drive going.  
  
The point is that our rush defense is pretty good, so teams have to beat us through the air.  If we are allowed to play physical defense down the field, we will win games.  If we have to play NBA style defense with hugs and fluffy rainbows, we will lose every game.This seems to be our MO.  We haven't won the division since 2012, but always seem to outperform in the playoffs once Joe reveals his final form.  Plus, imagine that we get Perriman and Suggs back sometime in December, after getting all these no-name receivers 12 games worth of reps.  
  
Suddenly we start looking like a deep team with a chip on our shoulder, playing on the road again.  That's the Ravens team which strikes fear into the heart of AFC teams everywhere.  
  
Calling it now - Ravens over Bengals in WCG.  Ravens over Bills in the division round, all to set up the annual January Classic between the Pats and Ravens in Foxborough.  Knock on wood, but Aiken was making some pretty Q-like catches against the Steelers on Thursday.  The kind of catches where he had to fight for the ball in close coverage and made difficult catches look easy just by sheer strength.  He has good awareness and body control like Q, and is basically the exact same size.  
  
His route running needs a bit of work, he needs to develop a better intuition for reading zones, and obviously he needs to develop a rapport with Flacco, but I see a lot of promise.  I see potential in him to be an explosive possession receiver if he keeps getting reps.  I agree that we definitely hurt ourselves just as much (if not more) in some of the games, but like I said - we *won't* win games where the flags are on a timer unless we figure out how to pressure the quarterback much better than we have been.  The games where we were allowed to play physical defense in the secondary made us look like a completely different team.  This is my new favorite circlejerk.  I love how everything is a conspiracy these days.  It's entertaining.Are you kidding?  After the reporter shootings in Va, if you sorted the /r/news thread by new it was nothing but scanner updates.  They even had the links to the dude's twitter before he uploaded the videos.
  
Anyone who is saying such things clearly isn't trying very hard if you ask me.  Reddit is what you make of it.  If it seems harder to find content these days, it's because the user base has such a hatred for curated content and moderation that the important stuff  constantly gets drowned out by the lowest common denominator.  This is exactly what people asked for though - to let the votes decide.  
  
/r/news is perhaps the worst offender since they take a very hands off policy, so the front page is always filled with clickbait and random outrage posts.  Some college has a new policy on microagressions?  Clearly that's the most important news of the day and the low quality clickbait editorial source belongs on the front page.  The front page doesn't update fast enough.  This apparently allows the admins to guarantee front page time for the guerrilla marketing posts they allegedly sell. Or something similarly idiotic.So far, nobody has said anything, but I'm also not obnoxious about it.  I'm not sure if we have a policy on vaping specifically though.  I know smoking is banned at basically any place of employment at the state level, but I have no idea if the extends to vaping or not.  
  
It's a normal office/lab environment, and I have my own office, so I really can't see anyone being worried about what I do as long as it doesn't bother anyone.   Well it sounds like everyone is on the same page then.  I guess it's just time to wait for a slow news cycle to maximize his visibility for safety and ensuing book deals.  &gt;As an American Citizen, this should never be up for debate.  
  
It really never has been.  Anyone who says otherwise is being hyperbolic.  The US has prosecuted a number of people for espionage over the years without torturing or "disappearing" them.  Snowden is no different, and at this point, I bet he's more at risk of being killed by Russia so they can blame it on the US for propaganda purposes.    
  
The big question to me is whether Putin would let him leave Russia whenever he wants.  The US has no reason to do anything but give Snowden a fair trial (and maybe a pardon after his likely conviction).Well, for one - Obama ended the "enhanced interrogation" program when he became president.  Even the Bush administration never tried to make a legal justification for torturing US citizens.  It was always limited to "Enemy Combatants."  The one "US citizen" they did blow up had allegedly renounced his citizenship.  
  
In fact, the US has quite a long history when it comes to prosecuting spies.  I know most of reddit is too young to remember this, but they used to make a huge fucking show out of it during the Cold War *specifically because* it was supposed to "set us apart" from "Soviet brutality," as a demonstration of the mighty due process of the US.  Parading spies in front of the camera and locking them away was a huge propaganda win for the US at the time, so I'm not sure why anyone thinks Snowden would be tortured or killed.  It really just lends credibility to the notion that Snowden is either being controlled by Russian handlers at this point, or that he has some seriously paranoid delusions.  He should know quite well that it's extremely unlikely that a fairly (relatively) liberal US president would have him tortured.  
  
However, if you look at it as a planted phrase for a Russian audience, it clearly reinforces their propaganda narrative that the US is the evil hegemon.  Based on much of what I've heard from Snowden recently, I really think this is the most likely answer.  Are the weapons loaded?  He wasn't in the military.  He would get a civilian trial like every other spy tried in the US.  He would also get about 15-30 years tops.  Recent espionage trials have been less than 3 years in most cases.With the possibility of parole after 8 years.  I guarantee he won't serve more than 10.damn, really?  My random online bank refunds ATM fees up to $20?It's definitely a gambling site.  I don't know how you can call it anything else.You can still threshold brake with ABS turned on.  The pro-Russian circlejerk on reddit is really confusing.  It feels like teenagers bravely rebelling for the sake of rebellion.But what did glorious Putin have for breakfast this morning?  Did he have glorious healthy bowel movement?  
  
Please /r/worldnews, these are the important things we need to know.The entire concept is far too nuanced to fit into a paragraph.  For example, lots of people might take this as "don't buy a house" but lots of people don't realize that home ownership is the primary way the middle class accumulates wealth.  So if you see "don't change your lifestyle" as "keep renting even if you can afford a house" then you would be doing the exact opposite of the correct thing.  Sometimes financial risk and leverage is the best option.  Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.Is the general consensus that sub-ohm coils are bad?  I just started this up again after going back to analogs for a while, and I am quite liking the 0.5 OCCs in my subtank mini.Ah, gotcha.  Thanks for the clarification.The bolt should operate smoothly.  What I have gotten into the habit of doing is boring out the door side by an extra 1/16" or so, and then I don't crank down the backplate screws completely tight so they have a tiny bit of play (a very small amount - like a mm or less).  This seems to give the lock enough margin to self-adjust  to some degree as the weather changes, and is the only way I could get my electronic Yale lock to work reliably.  You can also try some graphite or silicon lube on the bolt itself to help it turn.  The backplate screws are not essential for security (unlike the strike plate screws).  On the door side, the physical geometry of the bolt through the door is what provides the locking force.  
   
If it is really off now, and opening up the hole a bit doesn't help, you probably need to replace the door.  If you do, look into door materials which are built to minimize expansion.  And of course, keeping everything sealed up with paint will also help minimize expansion as the weather changes.  
  
  

If it is a rental, I honestly wouldn't worry about it too much.  The number one thing you can do to protect your stuff in any situation is to make sure you are properly insured.  This is especially important in a rental situation since you have very little control over other security.    
  
Are you sure that the bolt is actually hitting the strike plate and not the wood behind it?  You might want to open that up with a chisel as well.  Another FYI - the Yale locks (assuming that's what you are eyeing) require larger holes in the door than standard dead bolts, so if you get one, you won't be able to easily swap it out when you move.  
  
But yeah - I am with you.  I'd go without locks entirely if the insurance company would allow it.  I think it means that eventually, the Russians will exhaust the propaganda value of him being alive, and will want to cash in on the propaganda value of his death.  
  
Remember Litvinenko?  Russia was pretty embarrassed by that on the world stage, as well as at home.  Recently, they have really been pushing the US hypocrisy angle pretty hard, so I would not be surprised at all if they just killed him, blamed the NSA, and used that as ammo for their current propaganda narrative about how the US does all the same things for which it blames Russia.  "See, US can Polonium too!"
  
Seriously though, I find it absolutely hilarious how far up Putin's ass reddit is all of a sudden.  The majority of this site actually seems to believe that the US is more likely to kill/torture Snowden than the Russians are, despite Russia's long history of doing this sort of thing. &gt;  If Snowden was serious, he could walk over to the US Embassy this afternoon and put an end to his exile immediately

This is assuming that he is not fully under control of Russian handlers at this point.  A lot of what he has been saying recently doesn't make much sense for an international audience, but it makes perfect sense for the Russian audience - like he is being fed lines in exchange for the ability to speak in public.  
  
The thing about returning home as long as the US promises not to torture him?  Ridiculous - nobody in the West seriously thinks that's going to happen.  However, it makes perfect sense for a Russian audience which has been told that the US will torture it's own citizens... which never actually happened under Bush as far as we know.  All the renditioned combatants were foreign.  Not that it makes things any better.      That's not exactly US policy though.  Or rather, it's a gross simplification of the situation here.  If Snowden had released the documents and then turned himself in, he would be facing much less serious charges, and likely less than 5-10 years in jail.  The fact that he fled to China and then Russia with classified information likely made things way worse for him.  
  
I know reddit likes to be super idealistic, and I agree that what Snowden did was important and deserves some degree of praise, but that's separate from the laws he broke in doing so.  There is not a country in the world which would let this slide.  Leaking classified information could arguably be whistleblowing, but taking those documents to Russia is quite a bit beyond that distinction.He seems to think that he might be able to convince the US to only prosecute him for the leaks, and not aiding the enemy.  It's likely that the US would have charged his with the latter anyway, but the case is much stronger given that he fled to Russia.  It sounds like he is trying to get the US to charge him as if he had turned himself in before flying to China.That's sort of misleading.  Russia is not shooting at NATO jets in the area, so it isn't really a no fly zone, unless you buy the Russian propaganda that NATO is only pretending to bomb ISIS in Syria.Manning was tried by a jury of his peers.  She was not tortured or killed or any of the other nonsense reddit seems to think would happen.Manning did not receive life in solitary.  She got 35 years and will be eligible for parole in 8.  I very strongly suspect she will be released during her first parole hearing.I wouldn't assume el chapo is an idiot.  I think he knows what he's doing.The trick is to just boot your own car.Sounds like his entire game was disrupted by cell phonesThe problem is that you can't really measure success in any meaningful way.  If only the person being tested knows the absolute truth, then you really have no way to tell if they are lying.  If the investigator knows the answer, or the tester knows it is an experiment, it changes the entire dynamic of the polygraph.  Meh, even draft kings knows they are on borrowed time anyway.  That's why they are making such a massive media push at the moment - they need to cash in before they are banned.We'll see.  I believe it will ultimately be regulated as gambling, because that's what it is.  DK looks very predatory right now... I agree that if they quietly rode the precedent of the one court case which makes them a game of skill on a technicality, they would likely be fine.  But what they are doing right now is just inviting a whole different level of scrutiny to the whole industry.  It's like 1983 again, but this time I have a cell phone and my cigarette has batteries.With several Megawatt radars in the group blasting in every direction.  They aren't exactly quiet.  The state of /r/conspiracy right now gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "if you don't like it, you can go to Russia."I think that it is important to note that there is (or should be) a difference between running algos and requiring skill to win a game.    

Sure, writing the algorithm is a skill, but it's not the same.  It's essentially an exploit, like counting cards.  Blackjack isn't a game of skill just because some people can count cards.  Holy.  Fuck.  ITT: reddit excuses racism.Yes it is.  That's basically the exact definition.

&gt; If you don't pay attention, you'll wake up in the not-too-distant-future and see that your community doesn't look like your community anymore. 

Holy dog whistle batman.

This has been going on for a while.  The only thing which has changed as of late is that these posts don't get buried like they should anymore.The important thing to take away from this article, is that practices like this, as well as institutional discrimination by the FHA are a big part of the reason why minority communities struggle to accumulate wealth, and end up in a cycle of poverty and violence.  
  
  It's a perfect example of how racism has influenced socioeconomic demographics in the US.  Just remember that the next time some asshole says "slavery was 200 years ago, what's their excuse now?"Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.Good catch.But why would a team looking to unload a 3.1M cap hit want to take up 2.6M in other players? &gt;Tate converted $3.005 million of his 2015 salary into a signing bonus for salary cap purposes on September 8, 2015  
  
So... why don't all players just get paid in one lump sum as a "signing bonus" if that can easily eliminate cap space?  Do teams see the guaranteed money as that big of a financial risk?Wilmore's entire thing is Hyperbole.  The panelists were supposed to be caricatures of how conservatives view science.  I think Wilmore nailed Poe's law pretty well with that one, and I really don't understand how people don't realize this.I mean, he's technically correct.  Nicotine is technically poison.  It's a natural insecticide that plants evolved in response to insect infestations.  Humans willingly consume lots of poisons though - it's all relative.  I wouldn't exactly expect Colbert to take a nuanced approach to the topic on his comedy show.  
  
For better or worse, this is the image that the vaping community has sort of carved out for itself.  I love my vapes, but you have to have a bit of self-awareness here.  It's really not so outrageous that people are wary of this new, unregulated proliferation in recreational nicotine use.  If you take a step back, the entire thing really is pretty strange if you ask me.  It's part ignorance and part fear of the new and unusual, all woven into a millennial zeitgeist which seems to produce new and often unusual trends on a weekly basis. Maybe, though something tells me that Ozzy might not be quick to spend draft picks on short term fixes for a 1-3 season.  I'm not saying that we need to pull a Colts and play for draft picks just yet, but grabbing a big-money receiver after a slow start is quite a bit different than grabbing one to prepare for a likely playoff run after a 3-1 start.  It's just a bit short sighted.  
  
In Oz we trust though.  I'm sure he will figure something out.Chasing that nicotine dragon, huh?  Who doesn't remember that awesome feeling after their first cigarette?  The nic buzz is awesome, but it never lasts more than a day or two, unfortunately.  Two things - don't crank down on the OCC too hard when you install it, or you can crush the O-ring and mess up the air/juice wicking ratio.  It should be snug, but not too tight.  Also, take a toothpick and fluff up the cotton in the holes a bit.     
  
I think the spitting/gurgling is from the OCCs being wrapped too tight in some cases.  It causes the juice to wick unevenly so you get high concentrations of juice right around the coil and the rest of the batting stays relatively dry, which causes uneven heating and hot/cool spots which manage to produce both spitting and a dry hit in the same puff.  That's the issue I was having with the OCCs, and fluffing up the cotton a bit seems to help.  I guess in some ways, a Golden Tate deal would look good to the Ravens since the Lions are eating $3M in dead money from his contract already.  
  
Something like a Perriman plus cash for Tate deal could potentially gain traction if the Lions are resigned to a rebuilding year.  He's first round talent with a rookie contract and a nagging injury.  The Lions would have plenty of time to rehab him and he has a ton of inexpensive upside.  Maybe a stretch, but you never know - it could be an interesting value play for them.  Stranger things have happened - like us getting Doom because nobody in Denver checks their fax machine.Are these CFL/LEDs that are blowing, or incandescent bulbs?  Rather than a short, I'd sort of suspect a bad/worn out switch, or cheap sockets.  In either case, a poor connection can cause arcing and sagging - exactly the sort of thing which kills incandescent/halogen lights quickly.  In contrast, I would not expect bulbs with a ballast or regulation circuitry to have the same problems with dirty power.  Not really an answer to your question, but I like keeping the hot water cranked up to 150F+.  It makes it super easy to quickly "sanitize" knives and cutting boards (etc.) in the sink without getting out the bleach.  Between a quick pass with the sponge, and a hot water rinse for ~30s, you are pretty effectively sanitizing any non-porous surface.  Also, in a tankless system, it's not like you are spending oil to keep 50 gallons of water constantly at 160F, or anything.  Sure, you will use less oil if you turn it down, but at least it is an on demand system.
  
I assume your heating is hot water baseboard through the same boiler?  If so, it's really neither here nor there in terms of heating efficiency.  You'll lose a few more joules pumping to the farthest pipes, but all that heat should go into the house anyway.http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,20065922,00.html  
  
Are you sure that the boxes themselves are not grounded?  Have you tested with an outlet tester?  
  
Either way, it sounds like a potential code violation if the three prong outlets are not labeled as "ungrounded equipment."  It's not a *huge* safety issue - it was more of a big deal with analog appliances since a stray wire could energize the chassis.  These days, most appliances that like to be grounded are internally protected against this to some degree anyway.  
  
Honestly, with stuff like this, I like to double down on insurance, and keep the code violation in my pocket as leverage in case I want to break the lease.Not exactly.  The issue is complicated though, since it's not like the FSA is able to vet every person who claims allegiance to them.  What happened initially, is that when the US started supporting the FSA, lots of people rushed to join up for weapons, food and medicine.    
  
Some percentage of these recruits eventually drifted in another direction over the course of a complicated civil war, some percentage joined with the sole intention of stealing weapons, and some switched colors when territory changed hands.  This is not uncommon at all during civil wars.  Some overlap in personnel doesn't make the groups equivalent.
  
There was actually a pretty big attempt by the FSA at purging radicals early on, but once again, it's not like they have a massive bureaucracy dedicated to running background checks on all their recruits.  At this point, they mostly need warm bodies - it's not entirely unexpected then that there is some overlap or flow between the two groups, but the notion that FSA \u2261 ISIS is misleading conspiracy nonsense.  I think there are plenty of valid arguments against interfering in a foreign civil war - arguments which don't require us to oversimplify a complex and fluid situation in such a misleading way. Worst case scenario, it spoils and you wasted $5 worth of yeast. 
  
 Honestly, tap water itself can be effectively treated as sanitary in most cases.  It's a bit more risky, but there shouldn't be anything in your tap which will out-compete a properly inoculated *saccharomyces cerevisiae* colony.  The biggest concern would be if your equipment had some old, dried residual sugar left on it.  
  
Sanitation is important, and there is no harm trying to get yourself far into the low-risk probability tails, but it is perfectly possible to make beer with minimal sanitation.  People did it for hundreds of years before we even understood what sanitation was.  The biggest risk is contamination of the grain itself, which is why we boil the wort, but the risk of contamination from otherwise clean, but un-sanitized metal or plastic equipment is lower than lots of people seem to think.  
  
Plus, like I said - yeast produces ethanol as a defense mechanism against other bacteria in the first place.  That's the entire point behind fermented beverages in the first place - the yeast easily out-compete most other organisms and effectively preserve our ethanol-hop-water via this sort of scorched earth defense mecahnism. What I mean is that in most appliances, there is either an actual fuse which prevents hot-to-chassis faults, or there are electronics which act as a *de facto* fuse between mains power and chassis.  Or the chassis itself is protected from faults by virtue of being plastic.  
  
It's certainly not impossible for, say, a coffee maker or toaster to develop a hot chassis, but it's much more unlikely than the analog days, when basically every piece of metal inside an appliance was potentially hot, except for the metal chassis.  These days it would generally take a very specific and unusual form of damage or failure for something like that to happen.  It's going to take more than a loose screw or wire to do that in most cases.  It's basically going to require the power plug to fail in a very specific way, right where it enters the device.  Any failure past that point is likely to fry the electronics and isolate the appliance entirely, even without a ground.  I believe it's something like a little fuse or breaker between the chassis and neutral.  I suspect they are mostly used in the US in 240v appliances.  I know I've had to reset the one on my oven after the MC connector failed and the hot wire got nicked.  The oven was was grounded, but its breaker tripped before the mains breaker did.  Didn't you hear?  There's been a mass migration of US redditors moving to Russia because Putin is such a great guy.The other issue is that if CCL holders reach said critical mass, it becomes pretty easy for criminals to get guns.  Instead of a standard mugging, criminals start doing things like knocking you out with a bat as you round the corner.  I had a coworker who refused to go to a conference in Baltimore with us because he couldn't carry, and "didn't want to risk it."  As someone who grew up there, it was very eye opening to see how the culture of fear which surrounds gun culture can paralyze someone like that.  
  
I had someone with a concealed weapons permit brandish his weapon at a college house party because I was flirting with the girl he had a crush on, and she was flirting back.  I don't think he was seriously threatening me, as much as he wanted the girl to see his surrogate penis.

No, I didn't call the police because I was 19 and very drunk.I've used a fire extinguisher three times in my life.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/28/watch-what-happens-when-regular-people-try-to-use-handguns-in-self-defense/

Barrage radar: high power, broad beams, wide bandwidth scanning everywhere at once.  Very easy to detect, jam, fool, destroy, etc.  
  
Scanning radar: very narrow beams with narrower bandwidth swept very quickly across the horizon.  More difficult to detect and jam due to narrow beams and fast/random hopping.  
  
Fire control radar: When a barrage or scanning radar finds a target, fire control radar illuminates it continuously with a narrow beam while scanning continues.  
  
That's how you know you've been "locked" - When you detect the fire control radar.QE got me a 30 year mortgage at 2.95% Apr.In the US, they are still fairly uncommon.  Certainly nothing like what we see in the OP.  The only ones I have been to just had a conveyor belt in the (large) bar area, but the rest was a normal restaurant.  No robots or anything.  People from the restaurant could either order a la carte, or could come into the bar and grab stuff from the conveyor buffet style.  The bar side was supposed to be a fairly casual dining experience, while the restaurant side had cloth napkins and shit.More like, Jackdaws can't melt bullshit defensive holding penalties on every third down.  
  
/not salty at all That was the original definition of a brigade.  The problem is that once the concept became widely seen as a way to capture the narrative instead of just trolling, it was more often done with a wink and a nod from certain communities.  Like, I don't need to go into /r/guns and ask them to vote on an /r/news story.  I can just link the thread and they know what to do.  BUT MY SPORTSBALL TEAM IS LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN I HAD HOPED&gt;with a minimal investment on their own part.  
  
I know you mean "investment" to broadly mean human lives and equipment, but that show of force likely cost them about $200M in missiles alone.  &gt;And once the right combination has been found, it would be child\u2019s play for the hackers to make a fake key that will be recognised [sic] by the car as the real deal.  
  
I love statements like this.  Yes, duplicating an electronic key given a constrained code space is clearly on the level of putting blocks into the correct shaped holes.  It certainly doesn't require any engineering or electronics knowledge that your average child does not have.It's almost like no matter what you do, there will always be someone on the lowest rung of the ladder.  Even if everyone worked super hard and had completely equal opportunity, the world still needs people to dig ditches, and someone would still be the worst post-hole-digger with a medical degree.  
  
The question then becomes whether we believe that these individuals who, for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to talent, opportunity, and effort, are destined to work at this lowest rung of the ladder, whether these individuals should be relegated to poverty and hardship.  Do we believe that the wealthiest nation in the history of the world should simply allow people to go hungry and suffer the indignity of squalor?  Or should we take steps, regardless of what those may be, to ensure that everyone who wants is allowed to maintain a reasonable standard of living?  
  
Further, what do we consider a "reasonable standard of living?"  Is daily gruel and a tent reasonable?  Or should be people be entitled to diverse nutrition, modern shelter, and *gasp* a minimum level of recreation?  
  
This is what drives me nuts about the conservative message these days - people will roll their eyes and say things like "47% of all food stamps recipients have flat screen televisions."  No shit - why should these individuals not be allowed any form of luxury or recreation?  Are such things not important to a productive, stable life?  Should those who arguably have the most stressful lives not be allowed any escape from that at all simply because they are on public assistance?  How many doctors and engineers do you know who can lead their "socially productive" lives with no distraction, leisure or recreation?  Is this not considered vital to mental health?  Why then, do we expect people on public assistance to be "socially productive" without a minimum level of the same?  It sure seems to me like it is a sentiment which aims to punish people for being poor.  
  
That's the crux of the issue here.  We should not be arguing about *if* these individuals deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  This is literally a question from antiquity that we supposedly settled some 200 years ago.  We, as modern, enlightened humans should be arguing over *how* to efficiently implement programs and policies which promote these ideals on which the country was founded.On the other hand, the opposite is just as undesirable.  Universities should not become glorified trade schools who train engineers how to make gadgets, and managers how to herd engineers.  Things like philosophy, anthropology, literature, and generally the study of human culture are arguably just as important in the big picture of human civilization.  Without philosophy and literature, you would never get things like modern democracy.  That's literally the main thing which sets humans apart from lesser species - we write shit down - learning from, and building on the experience of our ancestors.  Trivializing this process as "not for everyone" seems dangerous, and rather elitist if you ask me.  
   
Furthermore, I'd argue that there are intangible benefits from a broadly educated public - especially when that education is well rounded outside of one's specific job. There is simply no need to pigeonhole education like that.  We live in a society where people need to cooperate and interact, so it follows that society as a whole broadly benefits from diverse knowledge - the kind which is best obtained through dedicated study.  I don't necessarily disagree.  That's not the argument though - the point is that we take steps to place bounds on this inequality.  It's OK for someone to drive a Porsche and someone else to drive a Civic.  The issue is when someone is driving a Porsche, and someone else doesn't have shoes.  
  
Stone Cold 316&gt; You have to get off your ass and go find happiness

Did you read the first part of the post?  The entire point is that no matter what, there will always be someone at the bottom rung of the ladder, regardless of their individual effort.  If everyone graduated from medical school, it would just mean that some percentage of burger flippers are also doctors.  It's a very simple thought experiment which demonstrates how effort and status are not as inexorably linked as many like to believe.  And this problem will only get worse as the number of high paying jobs becomes increasingly constrained.  There are simply not enough 6 figure jobs for everyone who wants one.
  
&gt;We should not be subsidizing people's shitty decision making capabilities  
  
Why do you assume that everyone with a shit job is making poor decisions?  I'd argue that your average doctor or lawyer makes plenty of terrible decisions. The difference is that those at the bottom are vastly more vulnerable to any given misfortune than those at the top.  FFS, a hedge fund manager doesn't go to jail for defrauding customers out of millions, but a poor person can be thrown in jail if they can't pay a speeding ticket.  Do you not see how this narrative about "effort" is a gross oversimplification of reality?And I'm a middle class guy who grew up with two parents in the suburbs, with a moderate talent for maths, who never wanted for anything as a child, and who had the opportunity to spend 10 years in college collecting graduate STEM degrees.  When my grandparents died, I inherited money from them.  When my parents die, I will inherent their wealth as well.   
  
Now tell me - do you think that I make more money and work fewer hours and have a nicer car than your average poor person because I worked that much harder than they did?  Or that I made better decisions than your average young adult?  I assure you that's not the case - I drink too much, I procrastinate frequently, and most weeks, I barely put in 40 hours unless there is a deadline approaching (see: procrastination).  Hell, I spent the first 90 minutes of my day so far posting things on the Internet.  The only thing which sets me apart from your average idiot is that I was born comfortable, and had access to opportunities that many people do not.  
  
&gt; If you can't afford a speeding ticket, be more mindful while you drive and don't speed. 

That's exactly what I mean when I say "vulnerable."  For a poor person, any given lapse of judgement up can have a massively disproportionate effect on their entire livelihood compared to a wealthier person making the exact same lapse of judgement.  That alone demonstrates how absurd the entire "bootstraps" mentality is - there is clearly an outcome gap here which spans across all aspects of life.    &gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how life really works.  
  
You are working from a descriptive philosophy, and I am working from a prescriptive one.  I acknowledge the reality of your statement, but I'm arguing that the current social status quo does not represent the end all, be all of human culture in terms of social stratification.  My entire thesis is that there is some hypothetical social ideal, and the debate should be about *what* that is and *how* we move towards it.  This should not be read as a condemnation of US society, but rather a frank discussion of it's strengths and weaknesses.  You are assuming that all "sides" of any given argument are equally valid and rooted in reality.  There are cases - and I believe that this is one of them - where one or more sides is completely off the wall, whether by virtue of ignorance, or willful deceit.  Philosophy is not physics - every argument does not necessarily have an equal and opposite counter argument.  
  
That's my entire point though - the actual debate here should be about how these issues are to be addressed, not whether the problems exist at all.  In a rational, earnest political climate where we are debating the former, you would be correct - there would be valid positions from a number of different angles.  Unfortunately, that's not the debate we are allowed to have, and I contend that those who argue that the problem doesn't exist in the first place, or that it does exist but we cannot solve it, are not engaging the issue in any meaningful way.Not sure if troll...  
  
&gt;We hold these truths to be **sacred &amp; undeniable**; that **all men** are created equal &amp; independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights **inherent &amp; inalienable**, among which are the preservation of life, &amp; liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness;  
  
Emphasis mine.  Surely you must see the irony in rejecting what is arguably one of the broadest and most concise visions of what the founding fathers had in mind for our society?Communism largely failed because it was lip service used by dictators in almost every case.  That's not to say that it is a realistic idea in the first place, but common good and motivation for upward mobility are not mutually exclusive things.  
  
I'd even argue that the current state of US capitalism has a pretty big dampening effect on motivation for many.   Lookup up at the mountain, seeing that there is finite room at the top, and knowing that many, many others are ahead of you - what motivation is there to even start the climb?  Are you supposed to be happy knowing you will likely never make it more than a quarter of the way up knowing that so many people were born feet from the summit?  
  
If anything, this is motivation to turn to criminal enterprise rather than trying to work in a system which has handicapped you from birth.  And we see this every day - poor people don't join gangs because they think it will be fun - they join gangs because they represent the most realistic chance they have at upward mobility.  Clearly a CIA False flag^/sMissiles are merely on vacation.You'd see wreckage if it was a drone.  I'm guessing that the missiles were detonated above the ground - possibly some kind of off-course failsafe, or even just a regular altitude fuse.  You don't usually want your missiles exploding when they hit the ground since that will dampen the explosive force.  Nor do you want it to explode the second it hits the roof of the building, since that won't do maximum damage to the structure.  The sweet spot for building destruction is probably something like 6-10' off the ground.&gt;Physicians for Human Rights says  
  
Why don't we get skeptical flair on any of the RT articles on the front page?I don't mean to be glib, but what part of the conservative philosophy do you support then?  Based on what you said here, it sounds like you are rejecting even the prevailing fiscal conservative policies from the past three decades (eg, supply side monetary policy).  Are we talking about 70's era conservatism?  Privatization of public infrastructure?  Opaque economic protectionism?  I'm genuinely curious.What about John Kerry?  Would you ever vote for a moderate liberal Kissinger? To be fair, Obama's legacy on these issues is inexorably tied to congress.  Things would look much different if he had more than 2 years with a democratic congress.The idea that people are choosing welfare over work in droves is a myth.  A conservative boogeyman.  I've never met anyone who was on food stamps who didn't want a better job and place in life.  I'm sure it happens in some places, but it's far from an epidemic.  Yeah, there are people who espouse a certain pride for being on the dole, but I strongly suspect that this is defense mechanism more than anything else.  Nobody can go through life hating their entire existence.  
  
In terms of waking up late and having picnics - so what?  If you are unemployed, what are you supposed to do?  Sit in the corner and think about where you went wrong all day every day?Coward.

Exactly.  Deny the problem.  Teach the controversy.  That's how we Make America Great Again, right?Ladies and gentlemen - your Grand Old Party.  This would be great if the Xbox was powerful enough to drive an OR.  No it isn't.  It's called salaried non-exempt.  It's a separate classification.I've been driving for 20 years and I've never seen or heard of anyone just driving around with their high beams on all the time.I'm amazed you don't make the kids wear safety glasses... The mental health angle is a dog whistle for "I don't believe that there is actually any problem with this."  I'm not saying it isn't a factor, but the people who harp on it don't actually want to do anything about it.   
  
I mean seriously - this is the narrative coming from a party who has routinely stated that they want to dismantle social programs, and who are so vehemently opposed to any sort of public health system, they will shut down to government over it.  Yet we are supposed to believe they support the creation of some kind of comprehensive public mental health system?  Pardon me if that smells like bull shit.  Republicans have been slowly dismantling mental healthcare in this country since Reagan started shutting down facilities in the 80's.  But seriously, they want to do something about the mental health situation, and they swear they will show you the plan once you elect them.  Pinkie swear.  Damnit Mazda!  You were a shiny gem in an industry filled with garbage and boring, shitty products.  I am disappoint.Wat?  Are people aware that LA now has cleaner air than Paris?  Do they think that's an accident?Unfortunately, this is an example of why we can't have nice things.  In places where there are no emissions or inspection requirements, people do stupid shit like straight pipe their cats or modify their trucks to "role coal."  Don't blame the regulations keeping your air clean - blame the assholes who don't think the rules apply to them.  It's not like these laws are in place because there was not a problem.  In 20 years, nobody I know has ever had a modern automobile fail an emissions test due to a failed cat, unless they modified it themselves or there was a serious maintenance issue (ie, cat rusted out).  This isn't a realistic complaint.  
  
Also, cats aren't $1200 unless you are driving an M3 or something exotic.   $1200 will just about buy you an entirely new header-back exhaust system for a Civic.  Just a new manifold and cat is more like $300.  
  
If it is welded inline, it's usually easier to just replace the entire exhaust manifold.  Those are almost always bolt-on.  It's certainly a factor to some degree.  It's certainly not the only factor though, and the people who are the most vocal about it have repeatedly shown they have no intention of doing anything about it.  Which makes it lip service either way.  
  
&gt;"I don't believe that mentally healthy people bring a gun to school and open fire on the crowds and execute people mafia style"  
  
That's sort of begging the question now, isn't it?  "You'd have to be insane to fly missions..."Trust me, I'd love nothing more than if the GOP changed tune on this and introduced a bill which funded a comprehensive, public mental health system in this country.  I'm a big fan of finding innovative or experimental ways to combat difficult social problems.  I'd even soften my tone on the matter to give it some time to work.  
  
All I'm saying is that until someone on the right lays out a concrete plan to implement such a system, there is nothing to do but view it as cynical lip service.Depends on the model.  I know the MS3 tranny is basically indestructible - people are putting north of 350WHP through the stock tranny and clutch.  The Miata and RX8 both had similarly rugged transmissions.  The drivetrain in my old Protege still felt very nice after 175kmi on the original clutch.  
  
I have no idea about the skyactiv autos, but Mazda definitely makes some nice (if not a bit notchy) manual transmissions.  I mean, objectively, of the few mass shooters who have been arrested, have any of them successfully plead insanity?  I understand that there is a distinction between legal insanity and clinical mental illness, but still - it seems more like "social deviance" is a more appropriate term than mental illness in this discussion.  Deviance is a more mutable concept which can be aligned with culture - many of these people would have never gone on a rampage if their philosophies were not so marginalized by modern culture.  Mental illness, to me, would imply the opposite - that these individuals would have become unhinged regardless of context.  
  
The level of premeditation, planning and philosophical thought (however horrific) which goes into these manifestos suggests coherence to me.  Unless we are willing to classify all white supremacists and racists and gangsters as mentally ill, which would sort of feel like we are back to begging the question.&gt;I have always felt marginalized and unhappy but that never translated into a desire to blow people away  
  
Sure, I mean - there is definitely a line there between people who, say, have rape fantasies or who watch bondage porn, and people who actually go out and commit rape.  However, I wouldn't go as far as to say that all rapists are mentally ill.  That seems like a fairly dangerous line of reasoning to go down, the logical conclusion of which would be that a large number of criminals are mentally ill simply by no other metric than they committed some particularly deviant crime.  It's the same line of reasoning which was used to classify homosexuality as a mental illness decades ago - the assumption that there is a social deviance threshold which implies mental illness.  I'm not suggesting that mental illness is not especially prevalent among criminals, but I don't think represents a sufficient condition for the classification.   
  
That's why I keep coming back to the "Catch-22" concept.  You'd have to be insane to fly missions, but anyone who tries to seek help must be sane enough to recognize their own insanity.  That's sort of what the "mental health" argument boils down to from my perspective.Interesting.  I'm not seeing a huge, lifted, immaculately clean pickup truck with massive smoke stacks and tires which extend well beyond the wheel wells, anywhere in this picture.  Am I doing something wrong?You mean every Eclipse?Sounds like he needs a driver upgrade.  Or he's got a boost leak somewhere. Or he slapped a fart can and an Si badge on his base civic.   A 2006 Si Civic should barely edge out a 2006 Lincoln V8 0-60, and should beat it by almost a second to a quarter mile.  I'm guessing he didn't know how to launch a FWD car very well. I live in a college town and drive an MS3.  It's kind of a douche magnet.  By that, I mean douchebags seem to view my mere presence on the road as a challenge.  
  
 if I had a dollar for every time some kid in a 335i or an LS250 try to race me at lights, I still wouldn't have my own trust fund.  Yup.  Jacked-up truck is kit for "I'm going to drive slowly in the left lane for miles, and as soon as you try to pass on the right, I'm going to floor it and then tailgate you for miles."When I am supreme dictator of the world, I will pass a law will make it legal to shoot these people on site.   The most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life was when I was driving back from the airport around 1am, and I come across the mom-mobile in the left lane, doing 5 under, talking on her cell phone.  I flashed my lights at her, and waited probably 2 oe 3 miles before going around on the right.  
  
Suddenly, red and blues in the mirror.  I slow down and start to pull over, van lady flies past, still obliviously chatting on her cell phone.  Officer ignores me and proceeds to pull her over for impeding traffic in the passing lane.  I drove the rest of the way home with a raging justice boner.Brother!  
  
I'm all stock with a tune (also pu), and I can still pace a 335i from about 20-80 before they start to pull away.  I can actually get a few feet on an s2000 with a rolling start.  It's a deceptively quick little car as long as you don't have to launch it. Shocking that they would say that.If there was a missile, it probably would have been detonated a bit above ground, so there might not be obvious debris or a large crater. There would certainly be debris if it was a crashed drone.   It's also not uncommon for "unnamed sources" to give "official/approved" statements to journalists.  Otherwise every quote by an unnamed source would be considered a leak, and those sorts of things are usually taken very seriously.  It's unlikely that literally every issue of the NYTimes would be leaking information.  
  
There are a number of reasons why an "official statement" could be given out anonymously like this though.  It removes the opportunity to attack the source directly ("oh, well remember when XYZ was wrong about JKL?").  An official statement by a named source could reveal which restricted information a given source has access to, which is bad INFOSEC.  It is a way of revealing information derived from classified sources without risking compromise of broader intelligence capabilities (eg, if it was an NRO official, Russia knows the intelligence comes from space.  If it is from the CIA, it tells Russia we have assets in that area of Iran).  
  
Most importantly though, "official public statements" are usually made by generals or cabinet members, or the president himself.  These statements carry a much higher burden of evidence than other statements, and it typically means the press will be asking lots of questions about the intelligence.  So, if they don't want to come fully out with why they believe these missiles crashed, it behooves them to have the information passed to the press anonymously.  This is not at all uncommon, and plenty of information which proves to be True is initially released like this. Yeah, I mean, she only sold something like 5 Million copies of Atlas Shrugged by the time she died in 1982.  Not to mention all of her other popular books.  Clearly, it must have been that 6% social security contribution which beggared her.  The fact that so many people take the political and economic philosophy of someone with no economic or political education seriously, really says a lot about the axiomatic nature of conservative thought.Yup.  This is the Trojan horse of personhood bills.  They could easily be used to arbitrarily turn any miscarriage into a criminal investigation.  Right, and her situation demonstrates perfectly why her principals were misguided.  Both philosophically and pragmatically.  
  
What I am suggesting is that democracies function through common will, and they aim to progress the betterment of their populations through a variety of social and technological advancements.  Her entire thing was intended to be a metaphysical argument against communism, but she never considered that perhaps the True answer was some middle ground.  Her entire philosophy was predicated on this single foregone, absolutist conclusion, and it is quite evident in some of her mental gymnastics.That's my favorite thing about not smoking.  Being able to taste food.  Right, and then I can't breathe in the workplace, so were back to hostility.&gt;WW3 and Chill?  
  
Putin swipes right./r/news is fantastic if you are a white supremacist or gun hoarder.Breaking: some people are unhappy. Other people are *very* happy.Like most things Matt Drudge says, it's very likely that the entire story is bullshit.Plus, its like easymode maths.&gt; redditor for 2 monthsI swear this is a baby boomer thing.  I hated most meat growing up because it was so bland.  Turns out meat is what you make it.In don't know about other places, but at my school, professors must offer a free version the the text for the class if they wrote it.  (Grad students do 90% of the writing though). 
  
Source: former grad student I have been pretty surprised so far that none of the vape shops have carded me, nor has any internet juice supplier used an age verification delivery service (so far at least).  I just sort of assumed the industry would try to stay out ahead of this issue.You have to understand that head shops specifically are usually not welcomed in the community by many.  Busy bodies are looking for any reason at all to get them shut down.  Same thing with liquor stores in some areas.  I've never heard of anyone's kids being carded at the grocery store though.  That is a bit ridiculous.  This is not a recent trend though.  DAE remember when rage comics were all over the front page several years ago?Yet far less horrifying than ripping off your toenail each year.My jaw is now sore.That would imply that it's not trivial to find borosilicate glass elsewhere.  "Will you selling anything at this event?"The problem is that they get really high pressure and manipulative.  My wife was invited to a "wine and cheese" party when we first moved into the neighborhood, and it turned out to be wine and cheese MLM.  She bought some (decent but overpriced) cheese, and now that's just our relationship with those neighbors.  They just want us to buy things from them and every conversation eventually goes in that direction.  So we avoid them, and I think they are catching on that we avoid them.
  
I don't know, but I can't help but think if I'd, say, borrowed a ladder from them as our first interaction, things might be a bit less awkward.   This is the best way to win over your neighbors.This is always so awkward.  Being that only couple without kids at an event where everybody brought their kids.  We made this mistake recently and the conversation eventually ended up at "what do you do with all your free time?" which was sort of insulting and awkward.    
  
What am I supposed to say?  "We drink on weeknights, sleep late on the weekends and spend money on traveling around the world?"  I couldn't help but feel a slight hint of envy in the air.&gt; Reads from script.

Edit - looks like it's quitting time at the MiniTruth.Requesting a drawing of Furry Donald Trump getting pegged by Furry Hillary Clinton while blackface Jeb Bush watches in the closet.Absolutely shocking.Which I guess is why they didn't bomb Assad after the chemical weapons attack?  Or is that just because Obama is feckless?  It sure seems like we are trying to cram both sides into this narrative.Well now I've been accused of being a CIA shill and a Kremlin shill in the same day.  A new personal best...  I must be doing something right.The Tfal nonstick pans are better than the All-clad IMO.  Way cheaper as well.CLARKSON!!EE here.  I think unregulated mods are just generally a bad idea and aren't particularly safe for anyone.  It's not an issue of knowing what you are doing, its an issue of what happens when something outside your control goes wrong.  Do the efest batteries have a poor reputation?I have no intention of using an unregulated mod, so that works.As someone who works in the field, it is absolutely a ridiculous claim.  When you are talking about the ECM game, it's first and foremost about power budgets.  Unless you believe that an SU24 has a larger power budget than a destroyer, then it is a very difficult claim to believe.  That's why the AWACS is a freaking 747.  
  
The secondary consideration is the quality of the semiconductors (noise figure sensitivity) and the CPU cycles available for processing incoming signals.  Both are areas Russia is known to be well behind the western world in.  
  
Seriously people.  Just as a general rule of thumb, keep in mind that Russia's top scientists have been fleeing the country in large numbers for more than two decades, their domestic Universities are not esteemed by any worldwide ranking system, and it has a GDP smaller than Texas.  While it isn't impossible, any claims of outrageous super weapons should be treated with a heavy dose of skepticism.  These claims are how Russia markets weapons to technologically illiterate dictators.Bullshit all the way down.But wait, reddit keeps telling me that Russia's super spooky EW toys are making NATO blind.  
  
Protip: this is the US telling anyone paying attention that these claims are silly.RIP calciumYou can get it at high end sushi restaurants for quite a fee.  It stays fresh if shipped whole and grated to serve.Dogs are the same way.  I came home one day to find our razor sharp high carbon chefs knife in the dogs bed, which he apparently pulled off the table somehow.  I wonder what he had planned for us that night.There are already far too many people in this world anyway.The neckbeard insecurity surrounding this story is hilarious.I wonder to what degree water filtration sequesters the uncombusted nanocarbon.  Of course it did.  Restaurant owners are realizing people are prepared to pay 20% more for their meal, and they want a slice of that.  $35k is not a great salary for a server.  I guarantee this guy upped his prices and ended up banking most of that money.Exactly.  What happened here is that owner figured out he could charge a ~20% premium on his prices if he implemented a no tipping policy, in addition to getting free press for the gimick.  $35k is a pretty low wage for a server in a restaurant with $15 burgers.  That's barely $100 per shift for a full time server, which is actually pretty low for a fancy restaurant, compared to collecting tips.  Hell, I used to clear $100/shift just in bar tip-out at a similar place.  An experienced server at a nice restaurant can easily clear $40k-50k or more.Yup $35k is quite low for a nice place. It's not surprising that skilled servers would not want to take a *de facto* pay cut."As an experienced engineer, I disregard anything from American engineers, because they have the most advanced weapons systems in the world."  
  
Cool story, bro.   Noticing a trend here.  You are the third "pro-Russian" with a 3 month old account (or less), who, in the last 24 hours,  has basically tried to imply I flip burgers.  Guess I'm doing something right.My wife went from being a bar tender at a fancier place to being a store manager for a large national retail chain, and took a pay cut in doing so.  The benefits are better, and there is opportunity for advancement, but the initial decision was harder than what it should be for moving away from what reddit seems to view as a "an unskilled job for teenagers."  
  
Really?  I'm restricted faculty who doesn't have any interaction with students and I make almost 2.5 times that much...My mistake.  Radio engineering is a large field.  I'll admit I've never worked on the AWACS, so I stand corrected. I'm more of a MANET guy.  It's still a large airplane.FLACCO THE FLEET FOOTED DRAGONYou realize that's primarily based on them making minimum wage, right?  Many servers do not report anywhere near all of their tips to the IRS.  For better or worse. This is why service workers hate customers, and former service workers are pathologically obsessive about being good customers.  "Bring my steak, pleb, and make it snappy."  Some people must be incredibly insecure to have this attitude.I think in some cases it comes across as a "then he goes home and beats his wife" sort of attitude.  That the people who are abusive or short to service workers have shitty lives, so they get great satisfaction from dangling a $5 tip and saying "jump."  Not saying that's True in every case, but it's definitely a very common topic of discussion in every restaurant.The Dragon is hungry and smells blood.EASYMODECleveland is a myth.  The team which is about 10 points and a handful of BS penalties away from having 3 wins is showing up.

Fuck.Hold on, THC is soluble in CO2?  They don't drive a pickup truck.  So it's going to be one of those games...The cannabis specific ones use an oven heating method which is very well regulated.

Lol, OK.Nah bro, ghosts are real.  Fuck, I have the same chair.As a side note, this is why you insure your house and possessions against fire.

They deserve it for being teenagers.Shit, just rig the pumpkin with explosives and a delayed fuse.  See how much those teenagers hate making inconsequential mischief when they don't have hands!No, you should probably just shoot them.  Castle doctrine and whatnot.Good.

Edit - Wow, and this guy has a 5 day old account.  So brave.  It's amazing how eerily similar the Koch Industries commericals are to the Veridian dynamics commercials.Because then they can't say "look, our clean Diesel technology is more powerful and more fuel efficient than a hybrid for less money!"  It completely defeats the appeal of those models. Not to mention, you occasionally see A-list US actors doing hilariously shitty European commercials which never air in the US.  That alone is worth the price of admission.is /r/news considered low hanging fruit yet?There's a bit more context though, which people like to ignore.  Both Baltimore and Cleveland had NFL teams moved on them.  The difference is that the Colts took the entire team history with them, so now it says "Indianapolis Colts" for all the OG Colts records in the Football Hall of fame.  Then, after the team literally snuck out of town one night without letting anyone know, the league passed up Baltimore for two expansions so they could give Florida a third team.  
  
In Cleveland, the NFL backed a lawsuit to keep the Browns' history in Cleveland, and then gave them money for a new stadium, and then accelerated expansion plans specifically so the city could have a new team in 3 years.  The Browns knew exactly when they would see football again before the vans even left.
  
So yeah, there's bad blood, and Baltimore fans like to poke fun at the Cleveland whiners who they feel got got off pretty easy.  That's why they are so touchy about it. ESPN's entire thing is subtly shitting on small market teams while jerking off the large market teams which have the most viewers.  It's their way of teaching the controversy to keep people hooked.Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.100% Agreed.  Get out ahead of this now.  Otherwise it will just be like the streamers all over again, complete with sob stories, giveaways and every other excuse under the sun to spam the sub with low-effort fluff.I would say limit this to comments only.  Or have a weekly sticky thread for referral codes.  For two reasons:  
  
1) We don't need low-effort referral requests filling up the sub.  
  
2) People will just make fake "request" threads and use it as cover to spam their own codes.  
  
Call my a cynic, but I've spent enough time as a mod on other subs to know that users come up with all sorts of very creative ways of gaming the system, seemingly for no reason besides the thrill of finding spam loopholes.  As if the very existence of rules is an affront to their better sensibilities.  
  
My concern is that a person will make an alt, make a fake thread requesting referral codes, and then use the thread to post their own code.  Or they will have org members make the thread so they can spam codes.  This is exactly what the streamers and org recruiters used to do before the sub cracked down on this.

Pollywaffle, an adopted Staffie Bull Terrier, won hearts when she turned up on the pages of pet adoption website PetRescue with a series of professional photos that made it almost impossible not to want to take her home. So impressive was her smile that Pollywaffle was given prime billing on a 2016 calendar of orphaned animals around Australia that is aiming to promote pet adoption. But even with that cheeky grin and a personality to match, Pollywaffle was going to need a special family to look after her. After being dumped twice at a shelter in Sydney, she was rescued by Calley Gibson-Stoll, a long-time rescuer who also happens to be a pet photographer  
  
?No, this is Yahoo!It's been tried a number of times.  The NRA will simultaneously spew rainbows about responsibility, trigger locks and gun safes, and then oppose any law which attempts to require such things.  I hear they are fine Scottsmen though.Matt Drudge is an idiot and a liar.The cooperatives were a "compromise" after Wonderbread Lieberman decided to kill the public option and stand with the insurance industry rather than his constituents.  Specifically, things he knows aren't True.Hey now, is not all idiocy.  There are also people pushing a narrative.I love it.  For the past year: "srsly guise, lets not make judgements until report is released." 
  
Report about to come out "srsly guise, the Dutch are just biased."While I don't entirely disagree with your assessment, keep in mind that we are discussing the non-classified capabilities of a brand new weapons system here.  The Zumwalts are likely somewhat more capable than we are aware of.  The platform is also likely planned around testing/developing future capabilities to some degree.  The way I have always viewed the program is as a starting point for ongoing DDG/hybrid platform development.  Let's be honest, the current capabilities of the A-B flight 2/3 Destroyers are already quite advanced compared to any foreseeable threat.  They currently field (arguably) the most advanced ABM and electronics/radar suite of any vehicle in the world, and we know we can crank them out like hotcakes if necessary.  With the newest A-B kit, the USN isn't exactly hurting for credible fleet-area defense like they were even 5 or 6 years ago.   
  
The DDG-1000 program is just a starting point for *potential* DDG evolution moving forward - rather than building 10 new AB destroyers, they are building 3 test platforms which will get everyone up to speed in terms of hull construction, systems integration and crew training.  This way, they can spend the next 10 years refining the designs and systems, and figuring out what does and doesn't work, so by the time China or Russia poses a realistic threat to the current fleet, there will be established TR7 systems ready for mass production.  What that mass production ultimately looks like might be very different though - we could very well see an ABM/fleet defense variant, or a smaller littoral variant, or a dedicated laser destroyer, etc.  It's hard to say for sure exactly what is planned, but I think it's not a terrible idea to try to stay one step ahead.  
  
The point is, when you are already out of sight of the next closest competition, you have a bit of freedom to experiment and try new radical things.  Not only does this give the US a head start in terms of next-get ship building logistics, it forces China to spend energy considering future threats (threats which may never even exist) rather than focusing all their energy on how to kill A-B destroyers.  Fog of war, and whatnot.It's both.  There is definitely plain old thermal damage as well.  I can't cook an egg on the sidewalk because of cell apoptosis - the sun provides more than enough IR flux at the earth's surface to damage exposed skin, in addition to the UV damage.  &gt;Rear window visibility.  
  
I'm not sure what you mean.  The rear window is just as large, and I love the fact that my rear bumper only extends ~5 inches from the window.  It makes parallel parking super easy.In addition to what everyone else said, having romex just sitting flush at the bottom of the cabinet like that seems like a bad idea.  Not only is it the first place water will pool if anything goes bad with the sink or dish washer, the box and wires also obstruct access to the space.  If you ever have to disassemble the trap, or unclog the disposal, you *will* have water draining into that area - you are going to have a drain pan literally sitting on top of romex, inches from the switch.  I'm not an expert on code, but I'm pretty sure you are supposed to at least have a drip loop on each side of the switch - that's best practice if it isn't code. 
  
Honestly, if I was a plumber and I was called out to work under there, I would probably refuse until the switch was relocated.  It's also going to send up a huge red flag for the inspector if you ever sell the house, and will make people wonder what other things you have DIY'd.  
  
But to answer your question - yes, that circuit should be 100% GFCI'd, and I'd personally feel much safer if that was a 2 pole switch.  &gt;brillo pad  
  
I guarantee you that if you read the care instructions, they specifically tell you *not* to do this.  Not only is the brillo pad far too abrasive itself, is has an embedded cleaner which is both caustic and abrasive.  That's the worst possible combination for a glass-ceramic surface.  While glass alone is very scratch resistant and non-reactive, the ceramic matrix suspension makes it significantly softer and prone to etching.   
  
Generally, that glass looks extremely scuffed up for a stovetop which is less than a year old.  The one we have is 8 years old and is still like a mirror in all but a few places (where I splashed some syrup onto a hot eye and etched it).  You really need to be careful about using anything caustic or abrasive on these surfaces - that means no bleach, no vinegar - not even the rough side of standard kitchen sponge.  
  
The good news is that you might be able to restore the scuffed surface to some degree of luster by using a mild rubbing compound or rouge, or even a baking soda slurry.  That's what the purpose made glass stove cleaners actually are - a very mild rubbing compound with a surfactant and grease cutting base.  Thank you for your submission!

&gt;Purely mechanical limited-slip diffs are reactive. That is, they don't begin to lock up until after wheelslip has occurred.  
  
This is misleading - depending on the design, the differential operates with a continuous torque-biasing curve.  It's not binary "open or locked" - it *always* limits the maximum torque differential across the half shafts up to the mechanical biasing ratio.  It doesn't kick in and lock once that threshold is exceeded, it begins to bias torque as soon as there is any difference across the half shafts, and locks fully once the threshold is exceeded. So if there is a 55:45 torque split across the differential, and the threshold ratio is 2:1, you will end up with roughly a 52.5:47.5 split at the output, and so on until you are at the 66:33 maximum bias, and the differential is "locked" (it's never actually "locked though" - angular velocity of the shafts can still differ.)   It's a subtle but important difference, because as you load the diff in a corner, it slowly starts to pull the car into the arc as it biases the torque *before* the outside wheel spins, until the diff fully locks.  If it was binary like this suggests, it would snap the car rather violently into the corner when the diff goes from open to locked.  If you have driven one, you know what I am talking about - how the car will scrub into a corner if not under power, but will "pull" you towards the center of the arc as you slowly load the differential under power.

This has become ambiguous nomenclature.  Lots of cars are now coming with "Electronic differentials" which are really just stability control electronics which use open differentials.  They do things like apply individual brakes, stiffen individual struts and modulate power to limit wheel spin and induce weight transfer, but they are not actually using as LSD of any sort.  Cars like the Focus ST and [older GTIs](http://en.volkswagen.com/en/innovation-and-technology/technical-glossary/elektronische_differenzialsperrexds.html) use such a system, which gives the impression of a mechanical LSD at speed, but it has a few shortcomings in terms of low-speed traction and conservation of momentum through corners.  One place where this is especially apparent is in the snow - a FWD car with a mechanical LSD is great in the snow, because the differential will prevent single wheel spin at any speed or cumulative load.  On the other hand, an "electronic differential" cannot achieve the same by applying brakes or stiffening struts - this only works if there is a velocity vector to correct.  Don't get me wrong, they do some neat things on the track, but they do not work the same way, and some suggest they might potentially cause uneven brake and strut wear (like if you punch it on the exact same on-ramp every day for a couple of years).
  
It does a few things, but one of the big impacts is that for niche cars marketed towards an enthusiast crowd, it keeps the prices in the used market inflated, which keeps people (and their deposits) on waiting lists.  This is vastly preferred to stocking inventory on-demand if you can avoid it, but it only works for enthusiast vehicles.  Nobody is going to pay to wait for a base Focus.  Then, in 3-4 years, once the used market starts to get saturated with supply, and prices start to fall, they can release an upgraded model and start the process over again.  
  
Shipping cars to dealers and having them sit on the lot brings a lot of overhead.  If you can encourage people to take factory delivery (which is what a wait list does) it will reduce overhead on a low-margin, limited production car, which also means production capacity can be scaled more slowly.I may be out of the loop, but I was under the impression that the FDA did not currently have any authority over the E-cig market at all, due to various courts stating that it was recreational use of nicotine and not a tobacco product, and therefore no current legislation allows them to regulate the market?  
  
This would hardly change anything though.  Juice vendors will just start selling unflavored nicotine liquid alongside flavor concentrate.  So filling a tank will just be a matter of filling it with nicotine carrier, and then adding a few drops of whatever flavor you want.  Just an extra step - hardly worth the bureaucracy of regulating it.   The entire basis for this regulation seems like it would be on pretty shaky ground from the get go if you ask me.  All this effort, and all it would take is one genetically modified  eggplant strain to undo the FDA's regulatory authority entirely, wouldn't it?  
  
Sure, it would take some time to establish a supply chain and manufacturing capacity, but I'd be surprised if that wasn't already in the works somewhere, and they will likely have years to scale up production while various legal battles are fought.  In the end, the FDA wins, but now it's 2020, and the entire nicotine synthesis industry is making nicotine with algae cheaper than it can be extracted from tobacco.  
  
Call me cynical, but I feel like this is more likely than getting congress to agree on anything at all, much less a niche enthusiast hobby.I personally like to keep a brick wall between my discussion forums and the industry as much as possible - for a number of reasons.  First of all, I can do without all of the low-effort giveaway and sales posts.  Second, I see it as a conflict of interest.  Vendors can pressure or deceive forum moderators in the direction of impropriety (has happened on other subs), and users might take these posts as a semi-official endorsement of a product, or be mislead by "sales" which are really just thinly veiled advertisements.  
  
Most other forums do not allow general discussion and official vendor activities in the same forum, choosing to sequester them for the above reasons.  Most other subs on reddit do not allow this behavior at all (user giveaways are OK, vendor giveaways are seen as CoI).  It sort of feels shady, it hurts impartiality (ie, the community might be swayed by an especially "generous" vendor and downvote any negative opinions of them), and it raises the specter that the sub is laden with vendor influence.&gt; a thousand fake accounts  
  
This is a good point.  It's more lowest-common-denominator nonsense.  I come to places like to for earnest and intelligent discussion, so if giveaways are attracting subversive posters, it's is going to drag down the quality of the discourse overall."Bruh, I have a job, so discussion which is intelligent and free from undue influence is far more important to me than $10 worth of free e-liquid."  
  
Honestly, a good forum is basically priceless, and in my opinion any vendor activity at all cheapens that.  I don't understand why these promotions and sales can't be sequestered into a dedicated sub for this reason.  &gt; Marketing spam IS a problem on this sub

Agreed.  It is highly unusual for a discussion forum to allow this.  I was browsing over the weekend, and the entire front page was literally filled with only giveaway/sales threads, and all other posts had almost no comments at all.  It was pretty off-putting, to be honest. I was going to make a post on Sunday, but the entire sub was filled with ads/giveaways/sales posts, and none of the other posts were getting any comments, so I decided not to bother.TIL reddit isn't a forum.I'll do it for 'bout $3.50If nothing else, this suggests that there is uncertainty as to what influence the vendors have over the sub, which cheapens the entire forum, IMO.Considering that the report basically eviscerates the Russian narrative that it was a Ukrainian MIG, I'd say that the inferences which can be drawn are not quite so trivial.And now it is officially bunk.Not to mention, it caused them to do a complete procedural and technical overhaul of the Aegis fire control system to prevent this from happening again.

Have you been following it recently?  There is actually quite a bit of content about to drop over the next few months.  The most recent demo was amazing.  Fucking flying 3D pewpew spaceships with my friends is going to be amazing.  Don't lose faith yet - these guys have enough money to do most of what they said, and I still think the game is going to be good.  Either way, it's only three years into a 5-6 year dev cycle... these two situations aren't really comparable IMO.Using the term "beta" unironically  is beta as fuck.My reaction is mostly "they'll figure it out when they hit puberty."It's not a quick return on investment, at least.  The demo was actually live gameplay footage though.  
  
I don't disagree that there is a lot of Hype^tm surrounding the game, and some of the scope that they have promised is likely many years in the future, but most AAA studios take 4-6 years to develop original property (and they don't have to build a team from scratch), so I'd say they are roughly on pace to deliver a feature complete beta in the next 2 years or so.  A large part of the past 3 years has been spent building a dev studio and laying out the back end code they will build on - things should go a bit quicker now.  That's my hope at least.  I actually am a software guy by trade, so perhaps I am a bit more sympathetic than most.  Still, it's definitely not a scam - there is far too much community interaction - if anything, it's overly ambitious, but that's not such a bad thing in my mind. I guess we will find out shortly!

I was trying to buy a taco, and I apparently kept giving the cashier nonsensical combinations of coins, until he just picked the right ones out from my pile.  Also, dividing by 7 for the USD exchange rate is hard.  7 was always my weakest multiplication table.  This is why you travel with an Amex.  They are miracle workers.  I'm not entirely sure *what* they would do, but I bet if you called them about it, they would rig up some fancy concierge delivery of a temporary card for you.This is called money laundering.Inb4 Stone Cold 3:16This just has "disappointing gifts from grandma" written all over it.  There is *some* oversight.  The Class 4 lasers have to have a functional locking mechanism (in this case, a button code), they have to have an aperture block which can indefinitely withstand the beam (eg, a lens cap), and they have to be capable of being physically disabled (eg, a physical battery blocker which can be inserted).  
  
But yeah - I agree with you.  They aren't toys and I don't really need one.  I think the issue is that they have legitimate scientific purposes, but there is no law which restricts access or determines who "needs" a laser.    I mostly use mine to light cigars when I'm drunk.

We apologize for the inconvenience.I wouldn't be so sure.  So far the Syrian forces have not been able to make much progress even with Russian airstrikes.  The CIA-supplied TOW missiles have been chewing through Syrian armor at an alarming rate.  It's not like Iran has significantly better equipment, or more experienced fighters.  Moreover, the entire Chinese high command is reportedly laden with nepotism, infighting and power struggles.  As I understand it, the Chinese military is like a distinct social class which people enter primarily to climb the social ladder.  The officers are all the sons and relations of influential Chinese, and there are often large policy rifts between the military and the Ruling party.  Most of their soldiers are likely just as unwilling to fight a modern war as they are unprepared for it.  
  
&gt;Yes they have invested heavily into new advanced weaponry. But that is to fight with US in a possible Taiwan war.  
  
Some have suggested that much of these new capabilities are vastly inflated, with the intention to deter potential US aggression over Taiwan.    Because most of China's military capabilities are exaggerated.  They are oversold to make the US think twice about taking a harder line on Taiwan.  If they get into a direct conflict, they are just going to show their hand. I think you are vastly over estimating how much strategic interest the US has in Syria.It clogs up the page and it cheapens the impartiality of the sub.  There's a reason why most forums do not allow this sort of thing.  
  
I think the best compromise would be to handle giveaways like AMAs.  Require mod approval, schedule them in advance and post them on the sidebar a few days ahead of time so more people can enter (also increases vendor visibility) and most importantly - limit the number of giveaways per day.  
  
If the thought of this extra work makes the mods here hesitant, I think that in itself is sort of telling.  Also, I'd totally volunteer for the job.  More importantly, it just pulls the sub towards the lowest common denominator if you ask me.  The fact that there are people here who would game the system for $10 worth of free juice does not contribute to a productive forum.There has to be a better way!&gt;a tobacco product (that's exactly what nicotine is).  
  
This might be pedantic, but technically nicotine is a *Solanaceae* "product."  It is just most often consumed recreationally in tobacco form, or in our case, tobacco extract form, but there are a number of different plants which produce it.  Somewhere down the road, all nicotine synthesis could feasibly be done by vats of genetically modified algae, which sort of throws a wrench into the justification of the "nicotine \u2261 tobacco" narrative.I am so sorry people are downvoting you - there are a lot of people here who feel very strongly about this topic, and some who will even ignore science if means they can vape.  Not everyone is like that though.  Some of us recognize that the industry can coexist with some level of regulation and oversight.  The community is justifiably paranoid about overzealous regulation, but often seems to miss the point that sticking it's collective head in the sand is simply the best way to make sure their input is never heard.  
  
Also, there are a lot of vendors here who sell the stuff, and they have a concerted interest in keeping vaping wholly unregulated.  You will find lots of this influence here as well, but that's an entirely different can of worms.This is working from the angle that e-cigs are primarily a means of smoking cessation rather than a way to use nicotine recreationally.  Studies have repeatedly shown that it has a number of potential cognitive and mood benefits which might be separate from simply staving off feelings of withdrawal.  
  
To be completely honest, I would love to see tobacco outlawed completely, while still allowing other forms of nicotine consumption.    Yup, I'm well aware of the fact that just looking at the dot can cause damage very quickly.  I'm actually quite terrified of my laser, which is why I tend to need liquid courage to break it out.  I have like 5 pairs of functional (read: no ANSI or CE certification) UVEX safety glasses and I insist people wear them if I break out the laser.  I also lock the dog in the basement.  I do take it pretty seriously.  I know how much it costs to make - I used to import this stuff bulk from China a few years ago before this all really took off.  There is a lot I don't like about the industry, and a lot I think should be changed, and it alarms me that people assume the vendors and manufacturers have only innocent intentions.  
  
I think a lot of people see the hobby as the recreational use of nicotine, and not as just a way to stop smoking.  I sympathize with this myself.  I think the issue is that the official discussion in the medical and policy community seems insistent on treating all forms of nicotine consumption as tobacco consumption, and wants to regulate it as such.  This seems nonsensical to many since the entire point of vaping to consume recreational nicotine without exposure people to carcinogens.  
  
I think people feel sort of helpless when it comes to influencing this narrative, so they get very reactionary and defensive about it.  Understandably so - it does feel like the only vocal advocates users have for their hobby are the companies selling the stuff, which is a problem, because they only care about the bottom line.  I think people just want to medical community to stop with the disingenuous "nicotine \u2261 tobacco" narrative.  I think they want things like age restrictions and purity regulations but they don't want it done in a way which puts every small juice vendor out of business, which is essentially what the current FDA proposals are going to do.  I used to do it because I saw an opportunity to make some cash on the side while I was in grad school, before there were a thousand large players in the game.  I thought it was neat, it helped me kick smoking, and I was constantly asked where to get them.  
  
I stopped because I got a job which frowns on having business contacts in China, and I ultimately got priced out of the market by bigger fish.  I was never trying to make it a career - I was just trying to cash in on a fad.  The issue is that this feels like an arbitrary line in the sand, which doesn't mesh with how society treats other drugs, like caffeine or alcohol.  If we distill the ethical calculus down to the core issue here, it seems like nicotine is "vilified" to the extent that it is only because cigarettes cause cancer, and because the tobacco industry lied about it for decades.  I think the major exception people take then, is to say that all nicotine must be regulated like tobacco, when the nicotine is arguably the least harmful part of the plant.  That's like regulating bagels the same way as opium because they are both derived from poppy seeds.  Or like regulating Cola the same way we regulate cocaine.   It just doesn't follow.  
  
People are not opposed to any regulation at all, they are opposed to what appears to be overzealous treatment of the topic as if it carries all the same ethical considerations that tobacco does, which is completely nonsensical and disingenuous.&gt; That's some surprisingly responsible irresponsibility you've got going on there.

This is kind of my thing.Lol, OP thinks they have internet in convents.This is why I'm never having kids.  As someone who has subcontracted with Boeing - lol.   
  
All of these aerospace giants - Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon - they all have a very old guard corporate culture.  Which is fine, if you want your father's engineering job.  It looks great on a resume, but they will burn you out if you let them, and won't think twice about dumping you for younger blood unless you manage to carve out a niche for yourself. 
  

  
 I don't see anyone getting up in arms when GW poster watermark their pictures.Right, so then the child gets a little bigger and you have to hit them a little harder to have the same effect.  Eventually, they hit puberty and you've never developed any mechanism of control besides the threat of violence, so now you have an idiot teenager who's only exposure to conflict resolution is physical dominance.

You're right, nobody ever hits 10 year olds.

At what point does carrying a weapon like this for the sole purpose of intimidation cross the line into brandishing or causing a disturbance? This is why he has no chance at winning a general election.  Even though he is pulling support from about 30-40% of the party at the moment, a decent portion of the party seems to despise him for making the GOP look bad.  While I don't think they will vote for Hillary (based on polling so far) I strongly suspect that a Trump candidacy will suppress GOP turnout in a general election./u/TRUMPTRUMPTRUMPTRUMPLol.  "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office.  Except for this one."It still, on the surface, precludes atheists from holding public office.  Saying "no atheist can hold public office" is definitely illegal, as is anything which creates the same *de facto* restriction.  Which is why the courts ultimately voided it.  &gt;Bigger than you think  
  
I mean, it's not like it has been any secret that the penalty was going to expand over 4 or 5 years.  This is all laid out very clearly for anyone who cares to look for it.Uhh... And I hope a flamethrower will not be needed to deal with my dirty dishes...A one-off act of nuclear terrorism would be bad, but I'm not sure there would be any practical purpose to respond to it with a nuclear attack.

The race would be called by 9pm... the week before the election.  CNN would implode.  
  
I also could see a very real chance of Christie or Jeb running as an independent if Trump does win the nomination.  I just don't see Rove and Co giving up the ghost that easily.  Jeb has already gone on television and stated that Trump is a threat to the very foundation of Western Democracy, and then without missing a beat, said that he's still a better option than Hillary.&gt; and make them meet in a small arena

I don't think anyone is Using FedEx field these days.  &gt; Just have a popular vote

A little part of me dies each time I think about the phrase President Gore.A master debater as well.I don't think it's that simple.  It also prevents places like Kansas from using federal money to indoctrinate children with creationist nonsense.  Without some degree of federal standards and education metrics, districts in Texas could very literally take federal money and teach entire units on "why liberalism and Islam must be eradicated."  The current implementation might not be great, but removing all accountability from federal education funding is downright terrifying in today's polarized world.It's a misguided implementation of a reasonable idea.  You don't want to be throwing federal dollars at schools or teachers unions who do nothing but show old Bill Murray movies all day long and then pocket the cash.  Even worse, you don't want to create a system which would allow a random district in Texas to teach a unit on "why Muslims are the devil."  
  
So instead of creating a law which specifically addresses these sorts of issues (which some would find carries offensive implications) you wrap it up and present it as "core curriculum standards" which *de facto* preclude such activities.
  
I personally believe that there *should* be standards and core-curricula, because these things function just fine in other countries which mandate them.  It's just that "No Child Left Behind" was poorly written, but the current political climate of the past 10 years has meant that any attempts at replacing it are laden with partisanship which is even worse - like banning collective bargaining for teachers on a national scale.But teaching to the test is arguably better than teaching nothing at all, or teaching things like intelligent design.  I don't necessarily disagree, though teaching to a test is arguably not that terrible of a thing in elementary school, where the focus really is on mechanical knowledge.  It becomes more of an issue once you get into high school where synthesis and extension is the goal.  
  
I think the biggest issue is not so much the testing, but tying all funding to the absolute outcome of these tests instead of also rewarding for improvements and *relative* performance in regards to college placement, graduation rates, etc.  The problem is that teachers in poor areas are already working with kids who have severe issues with their academic motivation and home life, and punishing them for this is understandably frustrating.  What has always been needed was education reform which was vastly more comprehensive than just funding carrots and sticks.  But this would likely require giving up even more local control to the federal government, which seems untenable in the US.But what else are you going to do in elementary school?  At that level it is pretty much all about mechanical and foundational knowledge anyway.  There's not really a ton of controversy over what basic knowledge an 8 year old should be learning, and able to demonstrate.  I'm sure you would be even more upset if you asked you kid what they learned in school today and they replied "There is no Dana only Zuul!"  
  
I agree that teaching to tests isn't ideal, but it's better than not teaching anything at all, or teaching that the earth is 6000 years old.  
  
A lot of the hate for this is misguided in my opinion.  There is nothing inherently wrong with teaching to tests, as long as it is done correctly.  The high school AP and IB programs are considered highly successful, and they literally do nothing besides prepare students to take a test.  At the University level, entire semesters are made or broken on a handful of tests.  And the US college system is regarded as the best on the world.  
  
My point is that there are many things wrong with NCLB, but I feel like the whole issue about "teaching to tests" is overstated.  Tying funding to these tests, to the degree that it is currently done, is the bigger problem.  Not necessarily the tests themselves.And in 20 years, we'll have world renowned surgeons insisting that the earth is 6000 years old...Can you articulate why teaching to a test is necessarily a bad thing?  Especially in elementary and middle school?  I'm not suggesting that it's a great idea, but this entire discussion sort of seems to be begging the question to some degree.I won't.Wouldn't quietly opening up the PTU be the best way to make sure you get enough concurrent players to stress the servers?  I sort of feel like there would be a high degree of self-selection with regards to who commits to alpha testing after the first day or so, and you might not have the same attrition issues you are implying might be happening.  
  
The entire thing seems like it would be self-regulating to some degree.  You'll definitely overshoot the concurrency limits when the patch first drops, and then as people get frustrated and stop trying to play, you'd get a good sense for where the threshold actually is.Can I have your spot?  I have 150mbps and I like to punish Comcast by using lots of data.I know he's really involved and capable, but as a developer myself, I just imagine them sitting him down at a special "Chris terminal" which hits its own git server, just to make him feel special.  I absolutely hate when management tries to "lend a hand."  It's probably different with CR, but the thought just makes me giggle.&gt;On top of this, we all know we've been lagging in the world in terms of education. Especially with STEM  
  
It's an interesting phenomenon actually.  We lag behind in broad assessments of STEM education at the primary school level, but we set the bar at the University and professional level.  This suggests two things to meL:  
  
The first is that there is an opportunity and performance gap in primary education, in which the brightest, most fortunate students are over-performing, while the general population lags behind.  Our highs are just as high, but our lows are arguably lower, or at least more common.  We might lag behind Finland in terms of population representative assessments, but our top students are just as bright, and at the end of the day, we actually have more of them than they do. 

And second, that maybe the issue of primary STEM education is overstated to some degree.  You can train someone to be an engineer or doctor entirely within the university system.  In fact, many respected STEM programs won't even accept AP calculus or science credits, because they want their curriculum to be entirely integrated from the bottom up.  The first 3 semesters of an engineering program is frequently just a refresher of the last two years of high school.   
  
Right, and you got that experience as a young adult, when your brain was better prepared for that form of instruction.  That would be very frustrating to a 10 year old. Primary school is about mechanical knowledge, and higher education is about extension, synthesis and self-teaching.  Most young kids need structured education.  The one's that don't do have opportunities to do things like "Model UN" or independent study.  Critical thinking is still important, but that can largely be instilled later, once the knowledge foundation has been established.  Learning how to do long division comes before learning how to do 3000 level physics. Yeah, when I was in high school, classes were very stratified.  You had standard, honors, and GT/AP.  From what I understand this is less common now, and is almost non-existent at smaller schools.  Part of this is actually *avoiding* hyper-localized schooling, since this is easier to do if you have 3000 kids in a school compared to 300.  
  
I generally agree with everything you say though.Honestly, that just sounds like bad teaching, which you are always going to have in any system.  Common core tests certainly don't mark you down for using alternative methods as far as I know.  
  
Though I do agree that there is something to be said about making math relevant instead of procedural.  But once again, I'm not entirely convinced we can blame that trend entirely on CC as much as we can blame it on the fact that our most talented thinkers tend to take higher paying jobs.  It would be very interesting to see if the quality of math instruction correlates at all with the tech boom.  I think everyone agrees that teachers should get paid more though.\#JustSyrianProblemsI honestly would be pretty annoyed.  I wouldn't say anything, but I might send the county a bill afterwards.SUV driver is a menace, but the motorcycle driver should have also stopped out of the box.  I see people cutting corners like this daily.  That's why you stop *before* the line or crosswalk and then slowly creep forward to get the visibility you need.There is no friend, only Zuul!Every fucking day.  There are intersections where I have to stop a good 10 feet out of the box if there is someone turning through it, because I *know* people are going to cut that shit.  
  
My town has actually started experimenting with putting bright, reflective plastic pillars in the road to denote where the edge of the box is, so if you cut the corner, you will hit the pillar.  Unfortunately, they still seem to get hit a few times per month.  Mine is people who try to merge onto the highway going 10mph.  The acceleration lane is 100ft, so you really need to carry speed off the ramp.  But people are so damn timid to accelerate on the banked ramp (its banked enough that you can safely do 45-50mph on it), so they create a dangerous situation in the morning as they impede traffic trying to merge, and the effect cascades back onto the surface road lots of times.  About time.Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

At microwave frequency, atmospheric attenuation/absorption should be something like 3 or 4 orders of magnitude less than it would be for visible light.  And if they are using MASERS, there should be minimal free-space path loss through the vacuum of space (assuming you build a large enough collector on earth).  The next biggest losses would be from the rectification process most likely.  It would be interesting to see their white paper, though I sort of assume if they are seriously proposing this, they'd have worked out the math.Think about it this way - microwave radiation is attenuated much less by the atmosphere than visible light, so there would be a theoretical gain to be had by putting solar cells outside the atmosphere, and using microwaves to push the energy back to earth.  Rectification should be around 85% efficient, and we're talking ~4 orders of magnitude lower atmospheric attenuation for microwaves, so it seems reasonable at first glance.  Solar energy flux on the moon should be something like 10,000x higher than it is on the surface of the earth.
  
  Now, whether it's enough of a gain to be profitable over say, just building 1000x the solar area on earth, is the big question.  Though at some point, I imagine that getting to the moon will be inexpensive enough that this could work.Thank you for your submission!

We apologize for the inconvenience.BRING ME MY BROWN PANTS!Yeah, no argument here - in terms of safety, and not blowing up the city with a 10GW MASER, it's a terrible idea.  But in terms of theoretical power efficiency, I bet the math actually works out better than you think it does.  1cm^2 of solar cell on the moon might be able to get as much energy back to earth as a 1m^2 terrestrial cell, and that's even assuming we lose 99% of the incident power in transmission.  That could scale quite well if you can figure out some of the other tech issues.  But you are still limited by the powerplant's ability to drive into the wave and not get flipped back.  The boat itself might be inherently self righting as long as the hull isn't compromised, but that doesn't mean the people on board will  survive being repeatedly flipped and capsized if they aren't all strapped down.  Or that the ship won't eventually split in half if it crests too many swells.  From my understanding, only an aircraft carrier has the power, structure and crew accommodations to theoretically survive in any possible weather.There are actually fusion bombs though.  That's what a Hydrogen bomb is.  They just require a fission bomb as a trigger to start the hydrogen fusion process.  In theory though, you only need a very small ~~fusion~~ fission primary to create a very large explosion with minimal radiation.  In theory, you could use the same technology we use to ignite fusion reactors to make a pure fusion bomb as well, without the fission primary, and hardly any persistent radiation release at all.  
  
I think they got the question mixed up with "Which metals are most widely used in Festivus Poles..."Ah yes, the "House of Cards" school of political science.It might make sense in Hollywood fiction, but the ability to create a fusion reaction from a fission bomb is very geometry dependent.  Just like with the fission bomb, the energy needs to be applied in just the right way to create fusion.  
  
Just strapping a nuke to the side of a fusion reactor wouldn't create a bigger fusion explosion... it would just create a regular nuclear explosion, and maybe some blackouts and general chaos.&gt;The basic principle of the Teller\u2013Ulam configuration is the idea that different parts of a thermonuclear weapon can be chained together in "stages", with the detonation of each stage providing the energy to ignite the next stage. At a bare minimum, this implies a primary section which consists of an implosion-type fission bomb (a "trigger"), and a secondary section which consists of fusion fuel. The energy released by the primary compresses the secondary through a process called "radiation implosion", at which point it is heated and undergoes nuclear fusion. Because of the staged design, it is thought that a tertiary section, again of fusion fuel, could be added as well, based on the same principle as the secondary; the AN602 "Tsar Bomba" is thought to have been a three-stage device.  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weaponShocking.  You mean an axiomatic, high-concept simplification of the concept of "liberty," combined with an opposition to government social intervention, would necessarily imply benefit to the traditional ethnic majority, and their ability to concentrate power?  Nobody could have seen this coming.It's almost like the most populous ethnicity would benefit from "tyranny of the majority."Thanks mate.Same article, but with a [citation needed] flag. 
  
I believe that is called a neutron bomb when the pusher is designed to specifically undergo fission itself.  The original concept of the Hydrogen Bomb was to do the opposite - increase yield without increasing radiation release/fallout.  It's sort of distinct in that sense, and we are really just splitting hairs, because there is no inherent reason why the fusion bomb concept requires the pusher to undergo fission.&gt;You can see that the quality of the people he mentors is a lot higher than his own work.  
  
This is also the case with most professional sports coaches/managers.  They frequently played at the college level, or briefly at the pro level, but were not nearly as successful as a player as they are as coaches.  And vice versa - most of the best players end up making poor coaches.John Cena &gt;&gt; God, confirmed again.That took a whole lot longer than I expected it to, considering that these ads are so predatory, they make Vegas Casinos blush.  I believe the entire business model was to cash in as quickly as possible before they got shut down.  The ads were extremely predatory, but they worked brilliantly, considering these guys have apparently raked in tens of billions of dollars in the last 6 months.Thank you for your submission!

I think there are a lot of disillusioned people out there at the moment.  Once the reality of Trump or Hillary sinks in, we will be looking at a landslide.  Do not mistake reddit for a representative sample of the voting population.  The Democrats arguably don't even need the young reactionary liberal vote this time around.  If Florida and Virginia vote Blue - and they are very likely to - there is almost no electoral map which the GOP wins.  Unless they can turn NY or California red somehow.

You can even give the GOP Colorado and New Mexico, and the Democrats win 271-267.

I love the downvotes.  Someone's in denial.  The blue wall is real.  Get over it.Trust me, I'm not proud of this.  But Karma is Karma.  I don't think a holocaust like that is even possible in modern times, given the proliferation of advanced communications devices and infrastructure.  If Trump set up a concentration camp in Syria or Iraq, Russia would have satellite pictures of the atrocities on a live feed, and everyone with an Internet connection would be able to watch in real time.  
  
Boy, wouldn't that be an interesting time to be an American Liberal - engaged in a resistance movement against the US "government," supported by Russia and China.    Do not mistake reddit for a representative sample of the US voting population.  If you take away the liberal youth demographic entirely (much less the portion of those who comment on reddit), Obama still wins by in 2012, just by 30-50 electoral votes, instead of 125, or whatever it was.Bernie Sanders would make a terrible Frank Underwood though.   
  
I'm personally rooting for a Slick Willy vice presidency.  That would be epic.Do you think Hillary is like a secret conservative or something?  The healthcare reform bill which was her baby during Bill's administration was *way* left of the ACA.  She had one of the most liberal voting records during her time in the Senate. [Issue Trackers](http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm) place her to the left of Elizabeth Warren, and barely to the right of Bernie "Literally Jesus" Sanders.  
   
Reddit is the only place where Hillary Clinton isn't seen as pretty far to the left for some reason.  And that's mostly because the hive mind has decided that they don't like her, and has basically invented a narrative to reconcile this with it's own brand of liberalism.But is your mistrust an emotional response, or an intellectual one?  
  
Since about [1993](http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm) actually.  
  
It's sort of amusing that people born in 1998 don't even realize that the Clintons were liberal Boogeymen for almost a decade before they were even born.There's some debate over this.  The 12th amendment is usually interpreted to imply "eligibility to be elected."  However, Bill could serve in a presidential cabinet or congress and be in the line of succession.  Or the elected VP could resign and Bill count be appointed.  
  
I'm mostly just having fun with the idea of a Clinton/Clinton ticket, but Hillary could tap, say, John Kerry as VP, and then as soon as the inauguration is over, accept his resignation and appoint Bill.

The more of this we see, the harder the counterjerk will swing back the other direction.  Obama didn't need The Average Reddit Voter^tm to win in 2012, and neither will Hillary.  Arguably, the only thing she needs is high voter turnout in Northern Virginia.  The "Blue Wall" is sitting at 257 electoral votes right now, and Virginia makes it an even 270.  Case in point.

Source: white person.  RemindMe! 334 days.  So you think Trump has a chance then?I guess you are talking about how the GOP-controlled congress refused to approve $450M for diplomatic security?  
  
Also, the assertion that Clinton denied security has been [thoroughly debunked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/issas-absurd-claim-that-clintons-signature-means-she-personally-approved-it/2013/04/25/58c2f5b4-adf8-11e2-a986-eec837b1888b_blog.html)TIL 6 year olds have finals.You can also do it in a microwave.

This sentiment is held by a very small minority of people, which is over represented on reddit.  If you look at an electoral map, the case can be made the the democrats already have 253 of 270 votes locked down as of today.  If you throw in Virginia, which elected a (D) Governor and senator in an off year election, that number is 266.  If you assume that Florida will swing against Trump, then its basically already over for the GOP if they nominate him.  
  
Democrats arguably do not need the reactionary youth vote to win this time around, even though they will still carry the vast majority of millennials.  Yet the US voting system has stood the test of time for 200 years, while European Parliament systems have consistently shown themselves vulnerable to extremist influence, particularly from populist right wing movements.  People love to hate first past the post, but it absolutely keeps things closer to the center and is more resilient to reactionary swings in both directions.  A system which makes it easier to elect far left politicians also makes it easier to elect far right politicians.Yet the US voting system has stood the test of time for 200 years, while European Parliament systems have consistently shown themselves vulnerable to extremist influence, particularly from populist right wing movements.

In terms of other issue tracking metrics, she has been one of the most consistently liberal politicians in the US, going back to the early 90s.This pretty much sums up the entire Tesla zeitgeist.  He was not the genius he was made out to be.  He was perpetually behind the state of the art in the science and engineering community, and made up for it by peddling snakeoil and taking credit for work other people published.It's not quite that simple though.  Building and designing an Aegis Destroyer and its systems *can only* be done by US citizens.  The jobs - by law - cannot be outsourced, and the market for US weapons systems cannot be undercut by China.  
  
The same cannot be said about solar panels. They can be built anywhere by cheap third world labor.  There's also not anywhere near the same diversity or scale of engineering which goes into making a solar panel, compared to say a radar system.I actually do know quite a bit about him.  I am an electrical engineer myself, and I have a very good understanding of not only the Tesla mythology, but also the broader history of electrical engineering and the technical background which underlies his work.  
  
For one, Tesla was a believer in the Luminiferous Aether several decades after Maxwell demonstrated it was unnecessary, and even clung to this belief after Einstein (*et. al.*) put the issue to rest.  I know that he did not actively publish in peer reviewed journals, and never demonstrated an in-depth mathematical or physical understanding of his inventions.  It is this last point which largely explains his failure to influence the state of the art or create practical applications out of his theories.  He was a tinkerer and staunch experimentalist who created some interesting novelties, but never understood how they actually worked well enough to do anything practical with them. Numerous times, he built such devices and attempted to take credit for the invention only after other scientists had published theoretical descriptions of similar concepts.   
  
For example, he may have created one of the first first spark-gap radio transmitters, but his failure to derive the mathematics behind it meant he could not publish on the topic.  He then attempted to take credit for the idea only after others formalized the concept and built practical applications around it.  This is not at all surprising, considered he was either unaware of, or refused to accept *Maxwell,* whose work in unifying electromagnetism  ultimately became the basis for these theoretical models.  
  
Lots of people like to say that his lack of presence in the academic literature was due to his reclusiveness or disdain for academia.  But this is not the case.  His inability to publish can be directly attributed to his rote experimental process, and lack of theoretical background in the field.  Thank you for your submission!

We apologize for the inconvenience.What you are describing is known as "end to end" encryption.  And yes, it would largely preclude the usage of certain back door channels.  
  
However, the issue is not so simple.  There are two important trust factors when it comes to encryption - trust of the key exchange, and trust of the infrastructure.  
  
Manually overseeing the exchange of keys only solves the first problem, but does nothing to address the second.  End to end encryption does little good if your system or software is compromised at a higher level.  If the NSA/FSA/FBI/etc can obtain shell access to your phone or computer, then they can either extract your private keys, or just remotely take screenshots of you text messaging app, where the messages are displayed posy-encryption.  This is the biggest issue right now.  Encryption systems themselves are well understood, but are limited by the complexity and trustworthiness of their implementations.  
  
In that sense, what the issue ultimately boils down to is one of expertise.  The only way you can ever be sure that any given information exchange is secure, is to have the background knowledge necessary to verify the chain of custody yourself.  In that sense, it's not a stretch to say that the only people who can realistically communicate 100% securely, are certain kinds of engineers and computer scientists.  Everyone else lacks the background required to do so.  As such, for your average consumer, it simply doesn't make a whole lot of sense to build up or use highly complex encrypted system, because these are less user friendly, but fundamentally add little in the way of trust to the lay-user.  There always must be an assumption that a truly dedicated actor, such as a government or even organized crime, knows more than you, and can break the chain of command in ways which you do not understand.  Because this trade off will always exist for consumer level products, it actually makes much more sense to focus of proliferation through ease of use and transparency of the security layer than it does to focus on ultimate security.  Because if everyone is using similar encryption, it becomes much more difficult to single out any one user as a potential target.Thank you for your submission!

He did not develop the theory behind it (though he claimed to have) - he won a patent for a brushless, polyphase AC motor, which was superior to the designs of other polyphase AC motors at the time.  He then used this patent to develop a power distribution system around these designs, which were superior to others at the time.  His motor certainly facilitated the adaptation of AC power systems, but to say that he invented the underlying concepts entirely is misleading, and not supported by any evidence besides his own claims.  In fact, he was specifically being contracted to *improve AC motor designs* when he wont the patent for an improved AC motor design.  It's not like he did it in his garage or anything - he did it *in context of* the AC concept already being well understood at the time.    
  
We can speculate about what was going in Tesla's head all we want.  But the fact of the matter is that he claimed to invent lots of things that he never wrote down or told anyone about until someone else published on the topic.  The entire reason his ideas were "stolen" is *because* he never published them.  You don't think it's a bit suspicious that he would eschew the publication process, and then get upset when other people won patents for things he claims to have invented?  It seems like someone who feels like publication is below him, doesn't have much room to be upset when other people publish similar work.  Thank you for your submission!

&gt;I would wager that if Tesla could design a HV split phase system  
  
Once he had the patent for the motor (which once again, was just one novel implementation of the concept) it was a fairly simple exercise to create the demonstration by linking two motors together by wire, and demonstrating how turning one of them would also turn the other one.  
  
I'm not trying to take away from his accomplishment or contribution to AC distribution systems.  Merely pointing out that there is a distinction here between inventing the motor design which ended up facilitating the adoption of polyphase AC distribution (which he definitely did), and inventing the theory behind the entire concept himself (which he claims to have done, but produced no evidence to that end).   &gt;Children's costumesNO THREAD IS SAFEI am not alone.I'm amazed that people are offended by this.  Yeah, the one with the mother is shitty, but this is basically what unsupervised tweens do when they come across a tub of candy in basically any situation.No, seriously - this is why I don't buy AAA games anymore.  At least not at full price.  Speak for yourself.I will still wait at least a few weeks to see reviews.  Age 22 to present.  Basically everything about adult life.Jokes on them.  Cocaine's a hell of a drug.Nobody should be forced to sing anything.  Remember when reddit posted sexy or clever costumes for Halloween instead of children?  
  
/r/Facebook remembers.I mean, if you weren't a bit deviant before the zombie apocalypse, you probably didn't survive very long.That particular episode was basically half improv, but animated.  And I frequently have beer for breakfast when we run out of OJ.  Fite me IRL, OP.We gave out full sized bars to the older groups of kids, and one parent gave us shit when we gave their 4 year old a smaller piece.  
  
We aren't going to give out candy anymore.  Lol, WTF.  It's not like we were giving one kid in the same group a big bar and another kid a small bar.  The parents of young kids usually take their full bars for themselves anyway.  Like I said... This attitude is why we won't be participating any longer.  Try to do something nice... 
  
Edit - to expand, we are a neighborhood where tons of families drive to from other neighborhoods.  We get a burst of 50-60 small children before the sun even goes down.  The policy was intended to favor the actual neighborhood kids who tend to come out later.  Otherwise we'd run out of bars.  Lol, Halloween: Serious Business.Especially small children's costumes.  Seriously, this is why I stopped using Facebook.  I do expect this, and I don't care.  I have adult things to do on Halloween
Agreed.  I don't understand why people are acting like this is some crazy terrible thing.  It really should be expected if you just leave out candy.  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Plane is hijacked - terrorists tell the pilot "not to be a hero" from behind locked cockpit door.  Pilot uses pilot jargon about mechanical issues to get plane diverted, hoping the terrorists don't notice.  Terrorists do notice and blow up the bomb they snuck on board.  I... Don't know what to think about the fact that the ESPN announcers last week were leaps and bounds better than the garbage this week.  The world doesn't make sense anymore. I really don't think he was that offsides.  He anticipates the snap.  Some long snappers rock the ball forward before snapping it back and he moved the instant the ball did.  Eat a dick refs.  Blow the whistle if you want to play patty cake.

Your dank meme game and timing probably needs work.Cool, but it would be nice if the refs could extract their heads from their asses and not make us score twice.Motherfucker, Smith Sr. likely done.  For good time =(Could have been considered illegal touching for batting the ball if he never gains possession of it.Because the center is rocking the ball pre snap.  It's not rocket science.These fucking announcers.  He's not timing the wiggle.  It's a live ball as soon as the center moves it after coming set.C.  This guy fucks.  &gt;You have no choice but to call that. 
  
WTF?Ugh, now I have to root for the Steelers for a drive http://imgur.com/4bN9tcuEe-kay-ah?10 minutes and OP still couldn't get the camera to focus.Also, bigger teeth.It's possible to enjoy steak *and* think farm animals should be treated better Still, it makes you wonder what this team would look like with some more credible receiver threats.  It's a chilling effect feedback loop.  Many don't go there because its so rabid.  So smaller market teams are even more under represented than they otherwise would be.  Which makes the circlejerk even worse.  Etc.I have a Boller jersey.  It was a gift and has the flying B so I keep it around.  Or maybe that's the Eric Zier jersey...God dammit.  =[All I can say is I hope you pulled permits or you're going to have a bad time."Necessary" for it to technically count as finished square footage for appraisal, or if you are going to rent out the space.  Best practices otherwise.In your defense OP, if I had kids at 15, I wouldn't be telling people about it, so she might not be ashamed at all.That's 12 seconds to come to a safe stop, assuming you are skilled enough to actually stop it at that speed.  In my expedience, the vast majority of people riding bikes that powerful are not keeping it upright if they have to stop quickly past about 120-140mph.  Even newer bikes with stability control and ABS aren't going to help all that much at those speeds.In all likelihood an emergency stop from 200 mph is going to result in any non-professional rider laying down the bike.  Stopping is hard on 2 wheels.Just hope you only have to dodge once then.Especially don't just toss scraps on the floor when there are multiple dogs around.  This is a sure way to end up with bloody dogs.  I'm shocked how often I have to tell people this.  Just further proof that some parenting decisions are better not left to parents.  In my (vary large) high school, we had 4 levels of math by Junior year - standard, honors, and GT for the regular curriculum, as well as AP classes for those who were either that much more advanced, or who wished to double up.  It was at the point where "honors" was basically remedial math, and "standard" was basically to keep the disruptive kids out of the honors classes.  It may have been different in other social groups, but I saw many people catch shit for taking honors level courses, though it was mostly when some honors kids tried to brag about their straight As to the GT/AP students.  It was a strange school though - I guess there are probably worse things in the world than math shaming.I mean, welcome to the real world, I guess.  No professor cares about your work load in other classes, and no manager cares about your time liability outside work.  Life sucks, and then you grow up.  
  
I agree that younger kids, in elementary and middle school should have their homework limited to maybe an hour per night.  For these kids, extracurricular activities and sports are probably just as important for mental health and social development as learning long division.  But by the time they are 16 or 17 years old and are applying for college, this kind of time management is probably the most important thing they can possibly learn, considering a lot of the senior level HS curriculum is going to be repeated in University anyway.  Skipping out of freshman calculus with AP courses doesn't get you anywhere if you aren't prepared for the rigor of second year math courses as soon as you hit the ground.Thank you for your submission!

I agree that people should take any names on the list with a grain of salt, as there is the potential for misunderstandings and False accusations, but in the case where legitimate members are concerned, I don't really think there is any natural or granted right to anonymity - that's more or less an internet forum construct.  If the NYTimes came out with a verified list outing public figures, people would likely react differently - the entire concern (and it is a legitimate one for sure) with this leak is that anonymous is not known for their journalistic rigor.    It's a bit of both from my understanding.  The members who are "out" provide a sort of cover for those who are not, and those who are not tend to be the ones who are more likely to be influential public figures.

We apologize for the inconvenience.This is why these charts need to be read in context.  They don't say anything about the actual process of cooking, or how to use proper technique to turn ingredients into a dish.  Should I bloom my seasoning in oil prior to adding the onions?  Do I want a toasted or raw garlic taste?  Will fish sauce keep it's flavor after heating, or does it need to be added at the end?  And of course, the eternal question - do I want to taste the salt, or do I not want to taste the lack of salt?  
  
These charts are a great reference for if you need to make flavor substitutions, or create something from new ingredients, but they don't actually tell you much about *how* to handle those ingredients.&gt;Trial and error  
  
There is going to be a lot of that, sure, but I'd argue that starting with some well respected source material which goes into detail about the ingredients as well as the techniques involved is probably the best way to go, short of formal instruction.  I really don't like getting random user recipes off the Internet unless it is a dish I have experience with.  I prefer to start with something like that ATK ~~bible~~ Cookbook, or even an Alton Brown recipe, because I know these will have detailed explanations of the entire process, rather than just a list of ingredients and maybe some bullet point instructions.  
  
How nuts will it be in 10-15 years when people are taking THC supplements, like they take fish oil or vitamins, to improve health.  It will become a massive, glaring cautionary tale about how reactionary democracy can fail in dramatic fashion.  There's still time!  We just need to rig like 100 or so games from this point forward.Er... More likely a joke on the academic reputation of the SEC outside Vanderbilt (and Florida.)I called this immediately in the game thread as soon as the announcers started bleating about it that first time.  It really is shameful that they can't synthesize basic concepts like "the ball is live as soon as the center moves it."They only figured it out after the third time though.  The first time they were besides themselves saying it must have been a missed call.You should really think twice about throwing this around so casually in reference to situations which don't involve genocide.

Oh, so it's one of *those* games...You're joking, but that's sort of correct.  There are lots of mushrooms which will make you sick (like food-poisoning sick), but only a handful which are legitimately deadly.  If you went around eating every non-Amanita you see at random without knowing anything else, chances are you'd be OK for quite a while, save a few days on the toilet.  This particular mushroom has no toxic lookalikes that I know of, and is considered a very good edible.It's basically just Amanitas - they cause about 95% of all mushroom poisonings and are fairly distinct.    Also an amateur collector.  The term "poisonous" is actually quite ambiguous when it comes to mushrooms.  Keep in mind that things like mild psychotropic effects, or an upset stomach can qualify a mushroom as poisonous, depending on the book.  *Most* mushrooms are fairly harmless, but lots will give you a stomach ache, and a very small number will put you in the hospital.  Even fewer still will actually kill you even with hospitalization - typically that's only certain Amanitas.
  
It actually requires a fairly low knowledge floor to identify which mushrooms you *shouldn't* eat, and everything from there is about building up a knowledge about what specifically *should* be eaten.  However, most mushrooms don't fall into neither category, so you don't really need to know anything about them unless you are a mycologist.  The primary knowledge you need is where the lists overlap.  The only one with it's ears relaxed.&gt;Children's costumesNO THREAD IS SAFEI am not alone.I'm amazed that people are offended by this.

The only one with it's ears relaxed.Perhaps, but "mah immesionnnn!" has become a dog whistle for "I value my niche playing style over everything else in the game."  Especially when it comes to casual play.  Or elements of the game which values fun over realism.
  
Take Star Citizen for example - there are actually people out there who find their own "immersion" broken by the fact that another player is using a mouse instead of a $300 HOTAS, and demand all gameplay decisions revolve around their joystick.  It's beyond obnoxious.Why do you think that's a Nuclear weapon?&gt;rational explanation. 
  
Nah man, it's a ghost.  Ghosts totally exist.  There are several issues here.  First of all, the quality of TSA agents is very low - when the program was first implemented, it was made out to be like we would have highly trained FBI agents doing HUMINT in airports.  Then someone realized that this would be exceedingly expensive, and a waste of perfectly good Law Enforcement resources.  So now we basically get every Tom, Dick and Harry who can pass a background check and show up to work on time running the machines.  
  
Which brings me to the second point - the blind reliance on technology, sourced from the lowest bidder, and run by the lowest common denominator.  Almost immediately when the new scanners came out, researchers were blowing the whistle saying they have serious vulnerabilities, and should not be relied on.  To be fair, even with the shoddy security theater we have here in the US, there have not been any notable incidents in the past 15 years or so.  I agree that HUMINT (not profiling) is something we have historically lacked in the TSA, but it's starting to get implemented here finally.  
  
The last time I flew the TSA agent asked me how I was feeling, and then asked me if the kids were staying with my parents.  I don't have kids, but it's this kind of non-sequitur which "jolts" people back to reality, and the response can tell someone trained in HUMINT a lot about a person's state of mind. Large crabs are both bottom feeders *and* high level predators.  It's a bad combination which can result in high levels of accumulated toxins in their flesh.  Thank you for your submission!

We apologize for the inconvenience.Not /r/linux - KiA has been trying to post this story to a number of different subs today, /r/linux seems to be one of the only subs allowing the content.  
  
I'm actually on the front page of KiA right now for removing the story from /r/technology, in the form of a modmail screenshot.  It's fantastically Ironic that they are complaining about not being allowed to discuss the story when it is the number one post on their own sub, followed by three posts referencing the story and how it is being "censored."Nobody uses excel for serious math or number crunching.  That's what Python and Matlab are for.  Yes!  The Hall of Tortured Souls was probably Microsoft's best work.Yeah, I would definitely rather clean than let random strangers in my house.This is grounds for divorce in my book.OP of full of shit.&gt;single mother.  
  
Danger!Yes it's definitely fake.  Nobody would get this excited about dating someone with kids.  The thing is - just because they have been in space doesn't make them any more trustworthy or reliable on the subject matter than your everyday whackadoo.It's copypasta...Somebody put a lot of time into this.All of this sounds like it would apply to a sole proprietorship and not an LLC.  Once the LLC no longer exists, the executives are generally not held responsible for it's liabilities.The original POTC came out what?  13 years ago?  Public opinion on the topic really switched quickly.This is why I think emails need to be protected like phone conversations.  If you parse through anyone's emails, you will find something which will appear improper out of context.  Your typical professor or even the janitor at a public facility has the right to absolute privacy when it comes to phone calls, but apparently their emails are open game for political posturing, defamation and witch hunts.  Right - state employees are government employees.  I'd say that's arguable.  I've been to Sweden a few times for technical conferences, and I saw a Moose while I was there, but that doesn't imply I have any expertise on the taxonomy of large European land mammals.  It just means I think I saw a moose one time.  The difference is that moose are not controversial or exciting, so nobody cares what I think about them.  On the other hand, there are certain people who will grasp at any straw regarding aliens and UFOs, so we get the copypasta like the one above.  It's part confirmation bias, part appeal to authority, if you ask me.  &gt;Traditional engineers are regulated, certified, and subject to apprenticeship and continuing education. Engineering claims an explicit responsibility to public safety and reliability, even if it doesn\u2019t always deliver.  
  
I generally agree with the gist of what this author is saying, but I think they are kind of missing the point as well.  The only regulated engineering profession in most places is civil engineering.  The *vast* majority of other fields accept an engineering degree from an ABET certified university as sufficient credentials for the title.  
  
I agree that a low-level programmer is no more an engineer than a low-level IT professional sysadmin, but that doesn't imply that there aren't trained engineers working in the networking field.  Engineering implies an expert level understanding of the scientific and mathematical principles which underly a given technical field, such that these principles can be used to synthesize novel approaches to solving various technical problems.  It's distinct from a "technician" role, which is primarily concerned with implementation and validation.  That's not to say that either one is necessarily more important than the other - they are yin and yang.  Engineers often make terrible technicians/programmers due to their penchant towards over-analysis and low-level problem solving.  Meanwhile, technicians often lack the mathematics and process implementation background required to distill complex engineering problems down into assailable parts.  
  
You absolutely don't want your typical electrical/computer engineer writing production code anymore than you want your typical civil engineer making welds though.  That's where I think the author goes wrong here.  In every example he discusses - from IT security failures to bugs in automobile controls - are almost certainly overseen by a team of engineers managing a team of technicians.  The point is that these systems are becoming so complicated, and programming has become such a common skill, that there is a bit of "art" lost in the process.  It's just as much on the shoulders of the actual engineers as it is on the shoulders of the technicians who call themselves engineers, and the non-technical managers who hire them.  You aren't going to convince a foreman that you are a master welder by googling tutorials and spending a few weeks in your garage with a $100 stick welder, but you could arguably convince your typical program manager that you are an expert after running through a month's worth of tutorials on your $100 netbook.  A civil engineer would never be allowed to hire programmers - why then, do we allow people who wear suits hire technical teams and manage technical work?  
  
In my opinion that's the real problem here, and is why competent technical managers are worth their weight in gold.  It's not the technical performers who are the issue, no matter what they call themselves - it's the treatment of all white-collar "office work" as homogeneous from a middle management perspective which allows the problem to exist in the first place.  If we applied the same management paradigms found in construction/civil engineering to the software world, most of the author's points would be completely moot.  Of course, that would mean the flattening of business hierarchy and fewer jobs and lower salaries for people who are trained in management, but have no other technical background.  
  
**tl;dr** - like usual, this can be blamed on management being stuck in the past.  Exactly - programmers are essentially software technicians, yet you will not find that phrase in any job posting anywhere.  Any failure to properly define roles and responsibilities seems like it would fall squarely on management then.  Unfortunately, engineers often make terrible managers, and good managers often lack the necessary technical background.  This is why it's so important to have technical people who can talk to the customers so the engineers don't have to.  Thank you for your submission!

Maybe "Full text of Transpacific Partnership treaty can be viewed here" - or something along those lines.  I will happily approve the submission then.  Please refrain from directed abusive language according to Rule #2.  This will be your only warning.  Thanks!  This is why we can't have nice things.  The rarest of the butts.To be fair, those designs were shit even with the safety mechanisms enabled, and it was bound to happen eventually.  Yeah, it has set back public opinion on the matter, but it also kept people in the 80's and 90's from generating a ton of nuclear waste that they really didn't have the technology to safely contain, and it spurred investment into renewable and (hopefully) fusion power.  Fission energy was always a strategic stopgap in my view - it's probably for the best that we didn't become overly reliant on it.  This is basically the case for everything mentioned in this thread.  All of these things were sort of inevitable in some way.  Call it the cost of progress.   I wouldn't say he ruined them *per se* - they are still massively influential in our society.  The people who are confused about the concept of trivial individual liberty versus collective social utility were bound to pop up sooner or later, once society was sufficiently removed from the threat of these pandemics.  Just like how holocaust denial is thriving the farther removed we are from WW2, even though there has never been any sort of equivalent report on the matter published in a similarly respected periodical.  But you can discriminate broadly based on age.  I can legally be turned away from a retirement community, and you will see lots of "no undergrads" on listings in college towns.   Well, on the topic of this thread...  
  
You can thank your friendly neighborhood slum lord for this.  I actually think it's a pretty good thing that eviction typically requires court intervention.  Landlords are in a position of immense power over their tenants, and that power can, and absolutely has been abused to exert undue influence over the lives of renters.  Everything from protection rackets to "I will evict you if you don't let my cousin stay on your sofa."  Tenants rights are intended to be a balance against such impropriety, and I promise you that for every seemingly obnoxious law, there was, at one point, some asshole finding loopholes in the current laws which required even more laws.  That's just the intersection of democracy and human indecency.  These replay attacks against the rolling codes are not really all that sophisticated.  Essentially, the thief needs some kind of proximity access to the keys to trigger it.  In the case of the NFC-based "proximity entry" devices, the thief can put an NFC antenna near the car to trigger the challenge, relay that signal to an antenna near the key to trigger the response, and then relay the UHF response back to the car  with a second antenna to open the door/start the engine.  In the case of mechanisms which require you to actually press the button to unlock, the thieves would need to actually record/relay the button press.   
  
Something as simple as foil-lined pockets/purses would completely prevent this from happening.  Of course, so would properly designed security mechanisms.  The real issue with the "keyless start" systems is that you can't continuously verify the presence of the FOB in the car (which would also prevent this) because you don't want the engine cutting off if you are driving and the battery in the FOB dies, or if your kid throws the FOB out the window.  That would be dangerous.   Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

They are just triggering a response from the fob when it is out of range of the car, and then using a recording of that signal to trick the car into thinking the fob is nearby.I just want to say - kudos to the mods for implementing the "spoilers" CSS instead of abusing and cheapening the NSFW tag like every other sub seems to do.  Yeah, but once again, it gets back to the issue of what happens if one large Org decides they want to just grief everyone all the time.  By being big enough and pooling resources, they would probably have the ability to break the bounty system completely by making it trivial for themselves.  It's simply not going to scale as a sufficient deterrent from individuals to large orgs, unless they apply a compounded multiplier across the entire Org.  Which would come with it's own set of problems.  If you are worried about this, it's probably a good idea to not keep any sensitive file systems mounted until you need to access the files.  Or even run your browser inside of a chroot jail.  That way the worst that can happen is that you lose your internet cache and downloads folder.  
  
Bonus points for running the whole system as a thin-client VM, with filesystems mounted as localhost network shares.  It sort of feels like this is the direction we are headed in anyway.   Extra super bonus points for running off a RAMDISK with symbolic links to the local filesystem.  
  
/Come at me bro.It sucks, but the most your average home user has at stake is the loss of their vacation pictures.  The biggest threat here is to enterprise systems, so networked thin clients running inside of individual chroot jails are actually a fairly realistic option for the paranoid sysadmin.  
  
Either way, there really is no reason why individual windows apps can't be run inside of individual, virtualized, protected sandboxes, sort of like what Android does.  Honestly, this would solve a number of the security problems which have plagued windows for years.  Especially internet explorer and PDF readers - there's really no reason why the application needs write access to the entire filesystem, or needs to be run as a privileged user.  There's really no reason why a file system needs to stay mounted all the time either.  The only reason a random flash ad can infect a given OS through a browser is because of shoddy design if you ask me.  How old were you when the ACA was passed?  The reason why we don't have a public option is literally because a group of 4 or 5 Democrats, led by the asshole Joe Lieberman, held up the entire process over this single point, so they could deliver one last victory to the healthcare lobby.  If every single Democrat had voted in lockstep, as you suggest, we would literally have a *de facto* single payer system right now. &gt;  Those items could have passed on their own
  
This is False.  None of it would have passed without a democratic supermajority, which was only in place for a few months before Senator Kennedy died, and the coward Lieberman chose to vacate his seat to a republican, which allowed the GOP to filibuster literally every democratic proposal for the next 3 years.  
  
If the GOP was willing to pass individual pieces of the legislation, then why didn't they ever propose that, or introduce the bills?And that piece of shit is far and away better than what we had before, and it would have been leaps and bounds better if Lieberman hand't decided to be difficult about the public option, which was the original lynchpin of the legislation.  IIRC, the mandate was only added to the bill once it became apparent that the public option was not going to fly.The only way they got it passed was by using emergency reconciliation of the senate bill (watered down by Joe Lieberman), because Kennedy was on death's door.  That made the entire thing time critical, because as you will (apparently not) recall, the GOP said in no uncertain terms that they would fillibuster any future proposals on the topic.  That's the entire reason why the house Bill with the public option was never even brought to a vote in the Senate.  Your interpretation of history is revisionist.

&gt;However, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of the proposed reforms by Democrats, Republicans began to oppose the mandate and **threatened to filibuster any bills that contained it.**[57] Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican congressional strategy in responding to the bill, calculated that Republicans should not support the bill, and worked to keep party discipline and prevent defections
[...]

&gt;Then, on August 25, before the bill could come up for a vote, Ted Kennedy\u2014a longtime healthcare reform advocate\u2014died, depriving Democrats of their 60th vote. Before Kennedy's seat was filled, attention was drawn to Snowe because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the Finance Committee on October 15, but she explicitly stated that this did not mean she would support the final bill.[84] Paul Kirk was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24.

&gt;After the Finance Committee vote, negotiations turned to the demands of moderate Democrats, **whose votes would be necessary to break the anticipated Republican filibuster.** Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying the Democratic caucus's centrist members **until the holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut,** an independent who caucused with Democrats, and Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat, representing Nebraska. **Lieberman, despite intense negotiations with Reid in search of a compromise, refused to support a public option**, agreeing to vote for the bill only if the provision were not included,[84][102] although it had majority support in Congress. His demand was met.[103] There was debate among the bill's supporters over the importance of the public option,[104] although the vast majority of supporters concluded it was a minor part of the reform overall,[102] and Congressional Democrats' fight for it won various concessions, including conditional waivers allowing states to set up state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.[103][105]  
  
&gt;**Brown's election meant Democrats could no longer break a filibuster in the Senate.** In response, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing Emanuel's scaled-down approach as "Kiddie Care."[117][118] Obama also remained insistent on comprehensive reform, and the news that Anthem Blue Cross in California intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him a new line of argument to reassure nervous Democrats after Scott Brown's win.[117][118] On February 22, President Obama laid out a "Senate-leaning" proposal to consolidate the bills.[119] He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. With Democrats having lost a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate but having already passed the Senate bill with 60 votes on December 24, comprehensive reform proponents' most workable option was for the House to abandon its bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, and pass the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, instead.

&gt;Various health policy experts encouraged the House to pass the Senate version,[120] but House Democrats were not happy with it and had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.[116] **With that option off the table, since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to be passed in the Senate despite another Republican filibuster,** most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.[116] They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.[117][121][122]

&gt;since all of this could be applicable to literally any content within that legislation.  
  
No, it wasn't.  At no point in the process did the GOP make any suggestion that they would vote for any part of the bill, nor did they introduce any sections of it themselves.  The entire issue came down to appeasing Joe Lieberman to get 60 votes, **which were needed because the GOP was going to filibuster anything else in lockstep.**  The house then had no choice but to pass the Senate bill.  Had Kennedy not died in the middle of the process, negotiations would have continued, and we would have a Public option.
  
Can you find me any citation that any part of the bill would have passed without 60 votes? You are being obtuse.  The only reason the bill passed is because the house agreed to pass the senate version as written, which was never the plan.  The only reason they had to do that was because Senator Kennedy died.  Had they altered even a single line in the bill, it would have gone back to the senate and would have been dead on arrival due to a GOP filibuster.  Read the damn wikipedia article I linked if you seriously cannot wrap your head around this.    &gt; They could have made it whatever they wanted and they had the votes they had at the times they had them.

Which is why we have the public option, right?  Had they done this after Kennedy passed - tried to pass the bill in pieces - the GOP would have vetoed anything in the senate, which is what they said they were going to do.  What you are saying is patently incorrect.  They literally did not have the votes after  August 25 2009.Those claims do not have a citation, and I don't believe them.  Honestly, I'm of the opinion that any enterprise back end which isn't running on some flavor of SELinux is playing with fire these days.  I think the most common infection vector for cryptolocker specifically is compromised flash ads, but it will then spread through any poorly configured enterprise systems like wildfire.Wait, but I thought the major flaw with socialized medicine was supposed to be the lack of innovation incentive?My god... I have been talking about this concept for years, and now I have a word for it.  
  
I always framed it as - would you do something for $1M which had a 0.1% chance of death?  Probably.  What about a 10% chance of death?  Maybe. At what absolute  probability of dire outcome would you stop considering any reward at all?Today the\u00a0mad scientist\u00a0can't get a\u00a0doomsday device, tomorrow it's the\u00a0mad grad student! Where will it end?!I think most reasonable people are against monopolized GMO products being controlled by huge monolithic corporations.  If GMO was a DARPA invention turned public domain, I think you'd find much less opposition to it.  Imagine if IBM had patented TCP/IP.  The world would look very different today.  Look at the internet.  Nobody made money patenting TCP/IP, but it has arguably had a much more profound economic impact as a public domain tool than it ever would have had under the control of any single entity.  It's open nature has literally molded the world we know today, which would (arguably) have never happened otherwise.  DANGER!I've been told that downvoting from the profile context did not record votes... Well, the man made *OK Computer.*  I feel like he could shit in a lightbulb, and the glory of this masterpiece alone would make that lightbulb amazing simply by proxy.  &gt;early time. 
  
Like before there was Google?  It also wouldn't matter unless the family also signed the NDA.  This isn't 1923.  Disney isn't going to send a bunch of hard hitting thugs with blow torches to go medieval on them, or anything.  Now I just sort of feel bad for all the other people who are going to die in the next few weeks.  That's plenty of time for hookers and blow.God damnit.I'm far more excited about a potential switch to higher frame rates than I am about 4K.  Every. Single. Slow. Panning. Landscape. Shot. Has judder and or tearing.  Once you notice it you cannot unsee it, and it's there in the theater and at home.  It kills me every time, and I don't understand how it is 20 fucking 15 and we've put men on the moon and are an inch away from self driving cars, but we still shoot our movies at the bare minimum Framerates which *almost* gives the impression of seamless motion, but only as long as the entire frame isn't moving.  That's not at all surprising.  Universalist ethics exist in a sandbox.  They only provide rules, but little in the way of a larger framework for synthesizing ethics outside of that sandbox.    
  
Great, your religion says murder is wrong, but what does it say about cutting someone off in traffic?  What does it say about fraud?  Or vaccines?  The fact of the matter is that if you are raised in a way which requires you to develop a moral intuition outside of an absolutist framework, you will absolutely develop better ethical tools, which can be applied more broadly, than someone who refuses to look outside that sandbox.  "Sandbox ethics."  If you never do your arithmetic homework, because you have the answer book, you will have no hope when it comes to synthesizing solutions to more complex mathematical questions.  The same thing almost certainly applies to moral intuition as well.  I was probably better off not knowing this.  Damn nature.  You scary.Now consider that this took thousands and thousands of engineering man hours at roughly $50/hr or more. Shit flows downhill.Cat.exe has crashed and needs to restart.The shitty one.I thought it was great.  The only movie I've ever seen where slow camera movement did not cause judder or tearing.  The entire movie should have been entirely pan shots.  
  
You forgot Hines Ward.  
  
Edit - oh were talking funny names, not dirty players?Lol, he should be suspended.  This isn't his first offense.  Why would your fandom have any impact on what you think about this waste of oxygen's antics?Preorder?  Like, in case they run out of digital copies?thanks obama.Is that Paul Ryan?Wikipedia says the largest specimin ever recorded was 2.1" - you should probably record the head sized ones for science.I mean, a .30-06 would probably kill a spider the same as a bear, but the bear is much easier to hit at range.  Wikipedia says that the spiders actually seem to thrive around humans due to artificial light and lack of predators.  Paul, you sure you ain't the hobbit?I hate to say it, but they'd have a long way to go to catch up the what Nvidia is doing with it's Tegra chips.  It's almost not fair at this point.  My X1 dev board is about 1/2 as powerful as a PS4, and consumes 10 watts peak.  
  
*10 Watts*That's also slightly misleading because it does have 8 integer ALUs per chip, but two of them share one FPU (as well as an L1 cache).  The vast majority of the modern CPU pipeline isn't spent doing floating point operations anyway (we have GPUs for that), and the performance of 8-core AMD chips in naively parallel applications typically matches or exceeds the equivalent (4-core, split execution pipeline) Intel chip's performance.  This lawsuit is going to be a hard sell for that point alone.
  
Also, while I agree that this is misleading to consumers, it's not like it was a secret or anything.  This has been literally beaten to death on every hardware forum out there.  Little Bobby Tables.Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.Yeah, it's definitely a bit of a grey area due to the arcane nature of microprocessor architecture.  But like I said - for your typical consumer application, it *is* equivalent to an 8-core chip in terms of things like memory loads/swaps, video encoding, and other basic GPP functions.  In that sense, I actually think the architecture makes a lot of sense in terms of price/performance for a consumer chip.    
  
On the other hand, a lot of the Bulldozer chips were marketed to gaming enthusiasts, which is one of the major places where floating point operations still actually matter to some degree.  But even that requires qualification, because most (well designed) modern gaming engines only use the CPU for instructing the GPU, and to handle branching logic.  Even physics are done with OpenCL/CUDA these days.  
  
The question gets even more muddy if you throw ARM into the mix, which doesn't even specify an on chip FPU at all.  Yet we still say a Tegra has "4 cores."  Or "4+1 cores" when the SIMD FPU is included.  Though, your typical consumer is also not making buying decisions for individual ARM chips.  
  
Maybe AMD should start calling bulldozer an "8+4 core" chip then.  But that seems even more misleading to me.  *shrug* I feel like the lawsuit is probably going to fail, but I would also not be surprised if it succeeded.   
  
Disclosure:  /u/socsa holds (nearly worthless) AMD stock.  As well as Nvidia stock.  Oh, you think Yorke is your ally. But you merely adopted the Yorke; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't hear *In Rainbows* until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING!Hyperthreading is what Intel calls it's split instruction/execution pipeline.  All modern x86 chips are capable of this as well, but the difference is that Intel adds a sort of virtualization layer which allows the pipelines to be managed by process rather than by thread in applications which are not already throughput bound.  
  
This is great for things like branching logic because it means that, eg, you can branch two blocking IF statements per core, which is part of the reason why you see better single-core performance from intel chips.  With an "un-managed" (for lack of a better term), split execution pipeline (eg, like on an AMD chip) a single IF statement effectively consumes two threads/one core, which is why the AMD chips often need twice the number of ALUs to reach the same die performance as an intel chip.    Of course, in applications where the execution is throughput limited rather than branch limited, it makes no difference at all, and AMD chips generally pull back ahead of intel chips.  "Targets"That's *sort* of what the Shield chipset is, but with a less general purpose, sandboxed OS, and no touchscreen.  Also, it's not the fastest graphics chipset they have (only 256 cores, I believe).  The dev boards run ubuntu though.  If they were for general sale, I'd buy one in a heartbeat to replace my HTPC.  
  
It's all about the unified memory architecture though.  Being able to use pinned, zero-copy memory really makes things a lot more efficient when it comes to real-time processing.  &gt;the company that is selling that device and program are required to make the Kernel's source code also available  
  
It's important to note that there is a pretty big loophole in V2 (not sure about V3) which allows something like an embedded system to only load signed binaries as well as external driver modules.  
  
So if you request the source code for your television, you are likely to get a generic embedded linux kernel in response.  However, if you tried to modify and compile the kernel and load it onto your television, you will likely find that the embedded system requires a signed binary.  Even if you can sign the binary somehow, you won't have access to the driver layer, since these are binaries loaded at run time, and are not kernel modifications.  This is exactly how Google gets around releasing the Android Radio Interface Layer and various chipset drivers.  &gt; "it's just a prank bro"

We apologize for the inconvenience.The article says the decision does *de facto* legalize it for the current defendants though.  Who are suddenly the most popular people in Mexico.Many baby boomers are choosing to either retire early on their personal savings for a few years before they become eligible for payments from their qualified retirement plans, or they are taking that savings and using it to start a business/farm/service of some kind.  Right - the Millennial generation is larger than the boomer generation, but the oldest millennials are still in their early 30's and the average age of that demographic group is now increasing (eg, the boomers aren't making new millennials).  At the same time, the oldest children of the oldest millennials are barely entering high school.  
  
The age of the boomers is highly clustered (as is implied by the term "boom") - so while there are lots of boomers (age 50-70) and lots of Millennials (or "echo boomers," aged 16-35) there are relatively fewer people aged 35-50 compared to these two groups.  This age clustering will likely extend for several more generations before leveling out.  That's not surprising because the boomer generation is highly aged clustered, and so are their children (echo-boomers, or Millennials).  As such there are lots of people aged 50-70, and lots of people aged 16-35, but fewer people aged 35-70.  This would only be surprising or concerning if age demographics were uniformly distributed.  Since they aren't, gaps like this are perfectly normal.  Where did you find the link to this thread from, if you don't mind me asking?Yeah, we can't actually delete threads - we can just make them non-visible on the front page and in /new.  I'm just curious if the thread is being linked to from somewhere else on reddit.  If you are interested in the most reliable brands:

It's actually pretty thoughtful of you to overtly discredit yourself and your peers like this.  It's absolutely adorable that they think going back to the "pre-existing conditions" days is going to win them support from anybody but their foaming, fringe base.  Actually, it might be a good thing in the long run.  If they do something so boneheaded, it's all but assured that they the Democrats will win back the Senate, and make up ground in the House, and then win the presidency again in 2020.  There are generally a lot of questions about whether Russian weapons can actually live up to their claims, or if those claims are heavily inflated to sell weapons.  The simple fact of the matter is that it's happened before, and while it's not impossible, it's a bit difficult to believe that Russia is making top-tier weapons system when they have a smaller GDP than Texas, very few globally ranked Universities, and have been going through a "brain drain" since the 80s.  Their domestic semiconductor industry is also about 20 years behind everyone else, so they can't crunch numbers like the west can, so their designs for things like AESAs and sensor fusion is likely relatively primitive.  There's actually a really good reason why the F-22 doesn't have 3D thrust vectoring.  Several really.  Complexity and weight are one part of the issue, but more than anything, it really hurts stealth to have giant, metal nozzles sticking our your rear end.  If an F-22 is in a turning fight with a T-50, then something has gone horribly wrong, and the F-22 would likely just run away.&gt;avionics  
  
Which relies on a modern, domestic semiconductor industry, which Russia doesn't have.  Civilian chips made by Intel 15 years ago, and which are considered obsolete by the US military, are still probably 10 years more advanced than anything Russia can currently make.  
  
The F22 production line has been mothballed, but it could be restarted relatively quickly if there was ever a need to do so.  &gt;Napping  
  
That's just the massive dose of benzos.  There's probably a reason his book is called "Gifted Hands" and not "Gifted Bioinformaticist." Florida and Ohio don't really matter if the GOP can't win Virginia.  Take the 2012 map, and give Florida and Ohio and Colorado and New Mexico to Romney, and Obama still wins with 271 electoral votes.  Unless a reliably Blue state with 20+ electoral votes swaps, there really is no scenario where the GOP can win the presidency without Virginia.Right, buy in the event of war with the West, Russia will find itself very much in trouble when it comes to their ability to make electronic weapons.  I find this narrative that overt racism is somehow better than marginalized racism to be hilarious.  That's some pretty strange looking bacon.  ConservatismNOTICE ME SENPAIThis is literally what liberals have been saying for going on 60 years.  That happened.The first rule of reddit: If someone says something with authority, assume the opposite until proven otherwise.The twist is that the painting is the bad guy the whole time.  I am Kevin Bacon.  Still wasn't better than *There Will Be Blood.*  
  
Speaking of which...The best part is how *No Country* drank it's Oscar milkshake.  Why was it removed?This doesn't make sense to me.  The woman went missing.  Friends and family suspected foul play.  Husband was the primary suspect, and the body never left the house.  How did the police not find a newly hollowed out wall?   Did they even look/smell inside the place she was last seen?   
  
Sometimes you hear stories about a molecule of errant blood, or a single hair leading to a body, which makes murder sound impossible.  Then you hear about situations like this which makes it sound trivial.  What gives?They must have put the new, blind cop on the case....which would be rubber stamped in a second.  Like most warrants.  Do people not realize how laughably simple it is to get a warrant?*Would you like to make a snowball?*It really is though.  It's laughably easy to get a warrant in a murder case.Thank you for an actual answer.I'm sitting in a mall parking lot, actually.  But I was at home when I made the comment.Trust me, I'm not proud of myself.  Yes, I watch Drunk History as well.There's technically no alcohol on that list thoughHe totally had it if that bike didn't weigh 35+ lbs.  Yeah, that was my thought as well.

"Do you have any idea how much rich people would pay for this in the US?"To be fair, pretty much everything in Reno is disappointing.FYI - the geeky term for the tech is [peltier cooler](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10080) and it would be way cheaper than $1300 to just attach a few of them to the bottom of a griddle with a temperature probe and an arduino. 
  
Of course you will need a heat sink on the other side, and some way of moving the heat away - maybe a water loop and a Radiator.  I'd wager you could probably rig something unreliable up for $200 or so.  
  
(The video in the OP is probably just using dry ice though, which would also work.)[Peltier cooler](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10080). 
  
Or just dry ice in a bucket.  Yup.  It would also sound crappy otherwise.  http://i.imgur.com/SCs9U8K.jpgThat's because life is futile and meaningless.  Like that bug which hit your windshield this morning, or the billions of bacteria which die every time you wash your hands.  Humans are not special.  Coming to terms with this is quite relaxing.  When u trying too hard to get on that front page./r/allYeah, sure - it's also somewhat more complex.  You're probably right though - the powered commercial units probably use refrigeration loops and not TECs, but TECs would make a very practical DIY solution.    
  
And actually, the flat TECs would probably make for a somewhat better heat exchange geometry compared to a refrigeration pipe, unless you can mold the loop into the flat top.  Might be interesting to crunch numbers on that.  I bet it would be roughly within the same order of magnitude sans specialized manufacturing capability (ie, just setting a piece of aluminum on top of a coolant loop with no other coupling.)  I mentioned the bisque.  THE 2th!I'm not so sure fabricating things to make oneself look more accomplished is a trivial thing for someone who wants to be president.  If Hillary Clinton lied about her brand of hair gel, reddit would be all over that shit as well.  What overwhelming evidence?  See?You really think they are going to completely overhaul the animations with a day 1 patch?  You preordered, didn't you?There's a lot of PM hate in here, but an effective PM is vital to project performance because they basically insulate the engineers from all the BS that engineers hate.  If you think a weekly progress meeting is tedious for technical staff, imagine how annoying it would be if you also had to handle contract issues, money allocation, purchase orders, travel requests and upset people in suits all day as well.  You'd never get anything done.  &gt;physical disks. 
  
What are we, savages?  Who says that?This is such a strange mentality in the US - that the less fortunate should not be allowed any kind of luxury for thenself, and should just live in a box and slurp gruel and be happy with that.  I understand OP's point, but I think this issue goes deeper than that.  I simply don't understand why reddit gets such a boner over this kind of shit.  Maybe the woman has a job interview which would net her a huge raise.  I guess the kids here have never had to make speculative financial decisions before?
  
I guess she's supposed to pull herself up by her bootstraps and go to her interview looking like a slob?  Because that's a pretty good way to ensure this entire cycle continues.You're right, it's not like living in abject poverty is a self defeating spiral, and not having any access to any small luxuries has been shown to contribute to depression and the inability to escape this cycle.  That's why we donate greeting cards telling people they are lazy scum who don't deserve stuffing on thanksgiving, right?  
  
Christ, reddit is fucking sheltered.    
  
Yup.  Downvoting legitimizes your simplistic teenage view of the world, where everything can be expressed as a meme.  Keep kicking the people on the rung lower than you while pretending you are making a difference.  That's what Jesus/Buddha/Allah/FSM would do.Right, my entire point is that this is a complex social topic, and it's not really the sort of thing which can be philosophically distilled into a meme.  This kind of othering just further insulates us from each other for no reason, and OP should feel ashamed that s/he feels the need to post a meme to feel superior.  We sit here and kick at the person on the ring lower than us, meanwhile the people at the top of the ladder are laughing, while they live in excess.  I'm suggesting that the situation is more nuanced that two line of text in an image Macro can communicate.Yup, crabs in a bucket.  The next time I go volunteer somewhere, I'll make sure to only help people who look sufficiently poor.  You keep upvoting dank memes.  Always under promise.&gt;I'd also suggest that a good half of the bureaucracy is created by them  
  
I'd argue that when this is the case, it's usually an organizational problem more than a management one. This is what happens when managers are fighting for relevance and visibility.  If there is a ladder to climb, people will try to climb it, which is why flattened management structures are so trendy these days.  
  
I've worked under both competent PM's and bad ones, and the competent ones are worth their weight in gold.  They are like a security blanket who I *want* around, because I know they are basically wading down shit river, building a damn around the technical staff.  These people do exist though, and a lot of them are former military in my experience.  Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.The important thing to take away is that you cannot easily lower or raise a fixed-geometry suspension (like Mac struts) without changing the steering axis, and impacting cornering performance.  It also means the direction of strut travel is no longer aligned with the incident force, which creates a torque across the strut, and makes it work harder by a factor of the cosine of the offset angle.   Seeing performance cars with a fixed-geometry suspension get lowered bothers me way more than it should.
  
I mean it's fine - as long as you value aesthetics over performance, but I cringe when people try to tell me they lowered their GTI to get better track performance.  No.  Bad modder.

It's part of the reason I don't post here much anymore.Still better than the dot method everyone loves so much.  My favored method was always a hybrid anyway - a very thin spread, followed by either a thin X or a line on top.

I will bring any team into the playoffs because the playoffs are the embodiment of "any given Sunday."   
  
TBH, you could have said the same thing about both SB teams to some extent.  The 2000 team played 5 games without scoring a touchdown.  The 2012 team lost 4 of their last 5 games in the regular season.  One of them to the Redskins.  Both of these teams were flawed in some way, but they still managed to find a way to win it all.  You just gotta Believe, hon.It's ok though, because the Mile High Miracle added 10 years to my life.That's not fair to Peyton Manning's face.You guys are taking it way more gracefully than you usually do.  I guess you are playing for a pick now this year, which is better than the typical Browns season of "Hey look, we won 5 games, maybe there's a chance... nope."You can literally see the man's soul leaving his body.I think there is a real possibility that CIG will eventually absorb Crytek entirely, considering the company is not doing well on it's own.  It makes a lot of sense because SC is now the primary tech sandbox for CryEngine anyway, and CIG could make some cash by licensing out their modifications.  There is a general trend in gaming to move away from abstraction layers like Direct3D and DirectDraw, towards a more CUDA/OpenCL-like workflow which is "closer to the metal."  This is where things like Mantle and DX12 come in.  They still allow developers to use as much abstraction as they need, but they also allow for development to be less architecture agnostic in order to squeeze out every drop of performance.  
  
A lot of it is actually being driven by console architectures, but it's generally an acknowledgement that relying on brute force to push polygons is starting to show diminishing returns, and that 3D application development should be treated more like embedded development.That's fine... I didn't say they were going to do it tomorrow.  I just said that the company is not doing great and it seems like a natural merger since CIG is their biggest customer (AFAIK) and already has the right to modify and redistribute the engine.

It seems like their schtick recently is to be vague about things which are largely unverifiable.  This time they've thrown out a direct accusation which is easily verifiable if True, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  
  
It makes me wonder if perhaps Putin himself is misinformed on the topic, or if he's gotten lost in his own propaganda.  And they are going to threaten to shut down the government again to do it.  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so terrifying how quickly they are sprinting towards the deep end.The implication doesn't even make sense in the slightest.  
  
Why would a non-profit which provides a huge number of medical services in a non-profit capacity (read: at a loss), suddenly decide that they want to make a profit from this one niche area which makes up a very small amount of their overall services?  It's idiotic, and revolves entirely around an easily dismissed premise.  Exactly - it would be fairly easy to find evidence of this if it's True.  It's not like "The Western Media" is some monolithic entity, micromanaged by ..."The West" - there are plenty of sources out there which would drool over the opportunity to break this story.  There are plenty of media outlets which would love to see Ergodan dragged through the mud.They don't really have shareholders - they have a board of trustees and a board of directors.  
  
Also, that Slate article is pretty misleading.  First of all, their primary citation ("easy to calculate") is a dead link.  Probably because the analysis was incorrect.  Following the first link ("as specific as the annual report is") seems to suggest that this calculation assumed that all "Non-Government Health Services Revenue" is derived from abortion services.  That's the only way you'd get to the "1/3 of their income" assertion based on those charts.  Second of all, they go out of their way to point out that "only 28,674 women received prenatal services" compared to 334,000 abortions, but fail to mention the 4.5M STD tests, 3.4M contraception patients, 1.3M cancer screenings, and 1.1M pregnancy tests.   A [less inflammatory analysis](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/05/dana-loesch/Planned-parenthood-86-percent-abortion-revenue/) puts the estimate closer to 20% at the most, and that's assuming all patients are paying the full list price on the website, which is very unlikely since the entire point of PP is that they mostly provide subsidized services.  
  
Either way, it's not really relevant what portion of their operating revenue comes from abortions, because they are provided at or below cost as far as we know (since they spend 744M on medical services, and take in only 311M from "Non-Government Health Services" - which is their revenue from providing services).  The implication you and Slate are trying to push is that abortions are being used to subsidize other services, and that's an incredibly big leap to make without an evidence, and is nothing more than begging the question.  In fact, they'd likely have *more* money for other services if they performed fewer subsidized abortions.  This is pretty clear if you read the charts without an agenda to push - they bring in 849.9M from outside (non service) sources, and spend 911.2M on all domestic services combined.  If you think about it, this makes sense, because they have a 433M shortfall in "medical service" revenue, and surgical procedures are likely their most expensive service, so it follows that this would also account for the majority of this shortfall. Ergo, the most likely scenario is that none of their medical services make them any net revenue, and that abortion services are likely the largest contributor to their *gap* in operating revenue.  Not the other way around.
  

  
&gt;then it must be subsidizing other services  
  
No, read the second paragraph I wrote.  It's very clear that *none* of their medical services operate at positive gross margin at all.  They have a 433M net loss on all medical services.  Your assertion only implies that abortions are the *most expensive* procedure that they perform at a net loss.  The 433M revenue gap is made up by Government funding (for non-abortion services) and private donations (for abortion services).  
  
Here's an example.  Let's say you provide all your services at 50% cost, on average.  
  
- You provide 100 $30 birth control pills for $15/ea.  Total revenue: $1500.  
- You provide 100 $50 pregnancy tests for $25/ea.  Total Revenue: $2500.
- You provide 6 $1500 abortions for $750/ea.  Total Revenue: $4500

Your gross revenue is from all of these services is -$8500.  All of them are done at a loss, so one *can't* subsidize the other.  Yet 52% of your revenue comes from abortion, even though it also accounts for a full 52% of your negative margin, which is by far the largest single source of your revenue shortfall, which you make up through external funding sources.  Does that make sense?  If external funding remains fixed, and you didn't provide any abortions at all, you'd actually have *more money* to subsidize your other services.  So the most likely case is actually the opposite of what you claim.

We apologize for the inconvenience.The efficiency of a simple full wave rectifier is around 80%.  Not trivial overhead, but that still means the microwave is drawing around 1.6W just to power the display.  Damn, you have an 1800W microwave?  What size circuit breaker is that on?  If it's a standard 15A circuit, you might want to look into getting a less powerful unit since most building codes require 20% overhead for a single device on a given circuit.  That's ridiculous...That's not loaded at all.  That's a very logical line of reasoning.  I remember having the same thought as a kid... And I still do.I'm sure this thread will contain a nuanced discussion about the reasons why people feel the need to resort to such things, instead of using the actions of one idiotic 20 year old to attack an entire movement.  Welcome to /r/newsIt's a shame that the mods on what is arguably the largest news aggregator on the largest internet forum on the entire internet seem just fine with this level of discourse.  They clearly need a larger team here, but they actively refuse to bring in new members.  But that's just giving in to what the lowest common denominator wants.

No, shes probably just literally hitler.    For whatever reason, this is one of those things which never gets called.  Look at any normal play during a game, and you will see the defense nearly a yard off the ball.  Look at any field goal or punt or goal line defense, and you will frequently see the players almost helmet to helmet.  
  
Not saying it's right, but it's just one of those things which never seems to get called.  Any given Sunday, etc.You should say 5 Hail Flaccos and perform 5 Tucker tributes to absolve you of any previous sins.SLI 980's would be ~$1000 alone, and a 4770 is ~$300.  Add in bargain bin RAM ($50), disks ($50), motherboard ($100), case ($50) and PSU ($100), and you're getting close to $2000 already.  Yeah, but then you get people who only listen to low-quality streaming MP3s through $5 earbuds asking why half the album is just static, and the other half is drums.~~Closer to $2000 than $1000.~~  
  
Edit:  *Tips waterblock:* m'980Posts like this - "I am unwilling or unable to to wrap my head around what it means to be an alpha tester" - is the only thing which makes me slightly upset that I have not gotten a 2.0 invite yet.  
  
CIG could totally put hashed source on a GIT server and require you to manually pull and compile updates.  It probably wouldn't cut down on the size of the "patches" since updates are not likely to me on the same branch, but it would definitely cut down on posts like this.Right, but the point is that the GPUs and the CPU alone are "half the price."

Ok, so they played a 40 second cut from it once.  I can deal with that.I think her first album made great relaxation/study music, but I just can't get into this one.  The opening to *Hello* just makes Lionel Richie start playing in my head.  Don't get me wrong - I like it alright, but I was really hoping it would have a move "live" soundstage.  
  
Did they release a pre-emphasized mix for vinyl, or is is the same cut as the digital mix? It's all just incredibly stratified by field and education.  I didn't even have to apply for a job or write a resume after finishing grad school - I had no less than 6 offers on my desk when I walked into my defense.  I'm not on Linkdin or Monster, or anything like that, yet I still get several emails from headhunters every month.  I've gone on interviews just to get a free weekend trip to LA (and Austin, and NYC).  
  
The issue is that so many people these days see their education as merely a stepping stone to a career, instead of an opportunity to grow themselves, network, and establish a body of work which will set them apart from the crowd.  How many people go through 4 years at University without ever interacting with their professors in a meaningful way?  How many people spend all their free time drinking and going out on mom and dad's dollar, instead of using that time to extend their classroom experience through things like independent study, volunteer work, portfolio development or contributing to open source projects?  The reality is that there are so many people who never do anything beyond what is required of them, that it's actually *very easy* to set yourself apart from the herd.  And it doesn't matter if you are a physicist or an Art History major - if you bring something unique to the table - be it experience or an insightful, well-written blog, or an earnest note from a professor, or a publication - people will fall over themselves to hire you.  Because these days, that kind of thing is so rare compared to people with 4 year degrees.  They don't have the caps.The trick is not to have kids, then you can have fun after you graduate.Excellent - now we just need a scientific consensus about whether cannabis actually impairs driving, or this is putting the cart before the horse.Thank you for your submission!

This is why it's so important to get rid of the "bootstraps" mentality entirely, and focus on building a functional welfare state where people are rewarded for work, but are not banished to poverty and squalor if they cannot, or simply don't want to.  There is simply no path forward where gainful employment opportunities exist for everyone, especially as we move farther and farther towards an automated knowledge economy."We're pretty sure they didn't actually mean 'well regulated militia' - we're pretty sure they actually meant to say 'any idiot with $200' - that's our strict construction and we're sticking to it."Thank you for your submission!

We apologize for the inconvenience.My wife is the same way.  I have a childhood ADHD diagnosis myself, and have gone between medication and behavioral therapy my whole life.  I recognized the signs in her, and convinced her to get tested.  Sure enough, she was off the charts.  
  
After going on the medicine and therapy, she has been happier, more even tempered, she reads better, and has gotten promoted twice at work in as many years.  She's an extremely intelligent person (the ADHD test includes an IQ test) but was frequently dismissed as a "slow" or "dyslexic" child because she never had the attention span to read or do homework.  I have graduate degrees in engineering, and her quantitative IQ scores were higher than mine (something she makes sure I will never forget).  
  
  But everyone told her she was slow as a child, and she just sort of went with it, and never pushed herself to achieve more.  I swear she'd be some sort of architect or crazy visual artist, or a power attorney if her parents hadn't been lazy fucks about the whole thing.I'll add - it's literally impossible to diagnose just about anything with 100% selectivity and specificity.  It seems like a far better idea to wildly over-diagnose than wildly under-diagnose, though ideally we'd find a method which optimizes both.  But it's not like there is a computer algorithm we can run to find the sweet spot.  She did just start an part time MFA program in interior design, but shes going through that "biological clock" phase where she is being pulled between her career and her desire to have children.  I keep telling her that we would be fine on one income if she wants to do school and kids for now, but she is very independent, and has a taste for "luxury," and I think she struggles with the idea of being solely reliant on me to pay for every latte, manicure and outfit.  But if he just wanted to scope out the place, then why was there so much lag time before he returned?  Why didn't he just bring the supplies with him and change in the parking lot?  The 30+ minutes of lag time suggests to me that he altered whatever schedule he originally had to start at the party.  I think his entire presence at the party was an attempt at establishing an alibi.  The thing is - maybe if one or two people had a concealed weapon in such a situation, they might have at least disrupted the plan.  But in a situation where lots of random people have guns, it's more likely to result in confusion, as everyone tries to separate good guys from bad guys.  
  
Think about it - you are standing in line in a mall, and suddenly you hear shots from behind you.  So you pull your weapon and take cover.  As you hunker down and try to assess the situation, you see another person running past you with their gun drawn.   You catch their gaze.  Quick - is this the bad guy or someone trying to escape the shooting?  You have half a second to make this decision.  You fire and hit the guy.  Someone else sees this happen, and suddenly thinks you are the bad guy, so he starts firing in your direction.  Now it's just a massive cluster fuck.  Then the police show up, and there are 20 confused, jumpy people with guns spread throughout the area while they try to figure out who the actual threat is.    
  
The fact of the matter is that the more people who are carrying, the more likely it is that there will be idiots carrying, and the more likely it is that something like this will eventually happen.  Especially if the shooter works it into his plan.  Of course, if you ask people who carry, none of them think they are that idiot, just like nobody thinks they are a bad driver.  Yet there are *tons* of bad - even reckless - drivers out there.  
  
The issue is just way more complicated than people like to pretend it is.  I think that in an ideal situation, there is probably an ideal saturation level of good, responsible CCL holders who *could* statistically prevent these situations.  However, if that saturation level gets too high, it's very likely to make the issue worse.   That's the real problem here - there is really no way to control this under a "shall issue" system, and it clearly pokes a hole in the logic "more guns = safer people," even if there might be some hint of limited truth to the statement, under the right conditions.There was also reports on the scanner of someone jumping out of the car in the target parking lot after they started chasing the SUV.  They showed this person being detained on CNN before the final shootout.He was making more than $70k based on the California public employee database.  He'd gotten a $20k raise the year before.  Assuming it was the correct listing.&gt; Paul wrote to Peter in one of his letters saying he was mad because Peter was eating with Gentiles and Peter

You have this mixed up.  Paul wrote in his letter to The Corinthian congregation that they were allowed to dine with non-Christians, and eat whatever was put before them.  The letters between Paul and Peter are largely considered by scholars to be "forgeries" anyway.  Not that it changes your point.

I've been to gun shows in Virginia before where "private sellers" set up with dozens of guns for sale, and they have some of the highest traffic at the show because they don't require you to obtain a background check. I always sort of assumed that these guys were "laundering" stolen guns somehow - guy like the one in OP steals guns, offers them for private sale to these private vendors, private vendors then sell them back to the public at gun shows.  Seems pretty obvious to me, since the only records are from the original FFL sales, and nobody at the gun show is checking to make sure these guns are not stolen.  In fact, I've heard more than one person joke about how "they have the best deals, as long as you don't mind that the gun is probably stolen."He may not have been doing well financially.  He filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and went through a divorce earlier this year prior to marrying his new wife in Saudi Arabia.

Chicken and waffles is not just chicken on the same plate as waffles.  Fucking Yankees.This is not "chicken and waffles."  This is chicken next to waffles.  "Chicken and waffles" is where you stack deboned chicken on waffles and then put some gravy, mustard and syrup on top of it all.  Then you eat it all with a fork and knife.  It's typically deboned chicken when done properly.  Chicken goes on top of waffles with gravy and mustard in between.  Then you pour syrup over it all. This is just fried chicken with a side of waffles.  Goddamn, I'm depressed I had to scroll down this far to find another person who knows what chicken and waffles is supposed to be.

It's like some people *really* want to believe that you can chain the doors of a campus building and methodically execute 37 people with a knife.  Virginia Tech was so deadly because the shooter was able to incapacitate entite classrooms in less than a minute, and then casually execute people who were still alive.  I don't care how good you are with a knife - you aren't doing anything like that.  At some point someone with turn a fire extinguisher on you, or start throwing chairs.  You also can't shoot out locked doors with a knife.  Not with one shot, but you can definitely empty a magazine into the door/frame around the lock and weaken it enough to break through.  "Breaching" as you understand it, is done with special weapons because you are trying to not give the people behind the door much warning, so you want to completely disable the lock in one shot.  *ParasiteYou're supposed to unwrap the BolognaOP has a girlfriend.1v1 me IRLMy dad got his legs and arms ripped off by an alligator, and as he was being dragged under the water, he used his teeth to gnaw a stick into a point, which he grasped with his mouth and repeatedly stabbed through the alligator's belly as he was being swallowed alive.

It used to actually be a legitimate combat ship with maneuverability and speed which would allow it to go toe to toe with much tougher (and slower) ships.  But the owners of the tougher ships whined enough that now it evaporates if you sneeze on it.
  
This is one of the downsides of community development - the most popular play styles seem to get nurtured at the expense of the less popular ones.TRIGGERED!The game is entirely CPU bound on nearly every system at the moment, so it's hard to say for sure.  There seems to be little difference between running a 4790+780ti or 4790+750ti.  Everyone gets low GPU utilization and frame dips in combat.  
  
They are allegedly aiming for high-end hardware in 2017, so we are probably looking at recommended minimum specs being the equivalent of a high end system today.  &gt; Star Citizen's flight model is much more complex than EDs.

Understatement of the century here.  And it's not just the flight model backend - the flight gameplay itself is massively, obsessively deep.  SC really does play like a combat sim in space to some degree, in that you need to micro-manage things like power allocation (DIVERT POWER TO AFT SHIELDS), weapons management (DIVERT POWER TO COOLING SYSTEMS), several different flight modes (think traction control settings on your car) as well at target prioritization, radar management (EM and IR), countermeasures, missile loading, and navigation.  It's very overwhelming to handle all this in single-seat combat, and it makes the skill ceiling really, really high.  It is also going to make teamwork immensely important for multi-crew ships.  
  
You can tell, even at this early stage, that they put a ton of thought into the smallest details of hypothetical space combat.  There really is nothing which even comes close to matching it anywhere in development, and it (as someone said earlier in the thread) make other AAA Sci-Fi combat titles, like Battlefront and Titanfall, look embarassingly lazy and shallow by comparison.  It's completely reset my expectations for what to expect out of a game with a $100M budget. That's not actually too far off from reality.  The game is very CPU bound at the moment, and while it is playable with less than a modern i7, you can expect frame drops into the 30s (or lower).  I'm running an FX8350 at around 4.6GHz with a 290, and I can't hold 60fps at 1080p even on medium settings.  I get drops into the 20s if there are a lot of explosions and missiles on screen.  This is just what software development is like.  Your average person just doesn't see it usually.  It doesn't matter if we are talking about producers or crowd funding investors - people will demand timelines which are often impossible to estimate more than a few weeks out.  
  
Ben sort of alluded to this, but I think some of it is that CIG still has this mentality that they are primarily dealing with engaged, enthusiastic backers with a very high level of technical knowledge, like they would be in a more traditional alpha testing campaign.  They have not shifted the marketing paradigm to target a broader audience, so little things like this don't necessarily raise the red flags like they should. Thank you for your submission!

In terms of being a solvent for removing deposits, there's really no evidence that it works any better than plain old gasoline, which you already have flowing through your injectors, etc.  It will make your exhaust smokey, which is why people assume it's "working," but that's mostly the result of putting oil in the cylinders.  Some people swear by it, but I tend to think it's mostly placebo.

We apologize for the inconvenience.Amazon has been running deals all week on various LED bulbs.  I managed to get a 10w 6 pack for $20 earlier this week.  
  
Honestly, unlike the CFLs, which seem to vary considerably in quality, I haven't really noticed much difference between Cree, Verbatim, GE and Sylvania LED replacement bulbs (the brands I've used).  All of them seem to have a half second or so delay in turning on, and all of them seem to like the dimmer to be about halfway up before they will come on (but then can be dimmed all the way down after that).  This is why it's so important to vote in local elections and to participate in town hall meetings.  Not only so you can have your say in things, but also so you can establish some degree of familiarity with your local officials.  Knowing a town council member or two will go a long way towards getting these sorts of "misunderstandings" resolved quickly.  
  
Also, understand that your average local inspector is incredibly jaded by people being manipulative, entitled assholes pretty much every day.  They are constantly dealing with idiots, whose understanding of civics extends no farther than what they read on bumper stickers, who are constantly trying to act like their little slice of land should is a sovereign nation, rather than part of a community.  I'm not saying it's right, but dealing with this kind of thing day after day makes them assume the worst about people, so even just approaching the situation with candor and respect can go a long way towards getting things done.They probably don't have any kind of accreditation.  As far as I know, there is no regulation in the US as to who can charge for an education, or who can call themselves a "University" or "College" like there are in other countries.    Because the entire "mental health" angle is just lip service and deflection.  Nobody on the right has made any attempt to articulate exactly what they plan to do about the issue, or how it will keep guns out of the hands of such people.  
  
Honestly, the most likely outcome of restricting gun ownership to people undergoing certain kinds of mental health treatment, will be to make fewer people seek out such treatment.Full cavity ultrasound.Only shameless partisans like Scalia and Thomas would place gun rights above issues of body sovereignty, because the word "abortion" doesn't actually appear in the constitution.  It's not like the entire formation of the country was predicated on the concept of certain "inalienable rights" which are so "self-evident" that they elude exhaustive articulation, or anything like that.  
  
I mean, FFS, the *entire concept* of personal liberty is philosophically derived from the notion that individuals are physically sovereign within their own minds and bodies.  Tossing such concepts out would literally undermine the entire foundation on which the Bill or Rights is built.  It's like denying the existence of electromagnetic radiation because it doesn't mention it anywhere in your WiFi router's "quick start guide."  You mean so a random idiot with zero engineering or demolitions training can blow themselves up by trying to make a homemade bomb, or get caught when they try to test it?  I'm willing to take that chance.  
  
Either way, by this line of reasoning, 14 year olds should be able to buy booze because they could easily make their own homebrew in their locker at school.    Yeah, but that would require congress to actually pass meaningful legislation, so we know it's not going to happen.  Conservatives hate the idea that women can serve in combat - not because there is inherently anything liberal about the concept, but because it was implemented while Obama was in office.  From a postmodern perspective?  It's not worse.  But from an orthodox conservative perspective?  It undermines the "tradition" that women are excitable little baby makers who would just be dropping like flies if they didn't have men around reminding them to breathe.  These were basically the same arguments people made when women started being employed in the same workplaces as men.  Eventually, it will become normal and people will got over it.&gt;A majority of 52 percent said Trump has the best shot of any GOP candidate to win the general election in November

Honestly, get fucked you boomer trash. Millennials have been sent to fight 2 wars and grew up during the worst recession since the 20s, and are starting their careers at a time when opportunity in the US is in rapid decline.  Most of them will never own a house, or receive a pension, and start at least $20k in debt.  Oh, but thank goodness Wall Street will throw scraps into my shitty 401k.  And it's the decadence of the boomer generation which can be largely blamed for all this.  
   
But yeah, how dare they "cry" about any of this.  How dare they try to influence politics or the direction if the country.  It's like these assholes are so ashamed of what they've done to people under 30 that marginalizing millennial culture is how they rationalize it all.  So yeah, boomers - you are the fucking problem.  So if I hurt your feelings because I won't tolerate you throwing around casual racism, then you can get over it, or get out.  &gt;the same. 
  
My father put himself through University by working at Burger King.  I own guns and I agree with everything OP has said so far.Because it seems like a reasonable approach to a complex problem which we've never made any actual effort to address previously.  Not all gun owners are paranoid ammo hoarders with delusions about FEMA camps or roving platoons of bandits trying to steal our televisions.  Some of us don't think that reasonable measures like this will prevent law abiding citizen from being able to shoot, hunt or defend themselves. Only shameless partisans like Scalia and Thomas would place gun rights above issues of body sovereignty, because the word "abortion" doesn't actually appear in the constitution.  It's not like the entire formation of the country was predicated on the concept of certain "inalienable rights" which are so "self-evident" that they elude exhaustive articulation, or anything like that.  
  
I mean, FFS, the *entire concept* of personal liberty is philosophically derived from the notion that individuals are physically sovereign within their own minds and bodies.  Tossing such concepts out would literally undermine the entire foundation on which the Bill or Rights is built.  It's like denying the existence of electromagnetic radiation because it doesn't mention it anywhere in your WiFi router's "quick start guide."  If the federal government ever actually tried to confiscate all guns, I'll be right there with you.  But it's simply not going to happen as long as our constitutional republic stands, because the second amendment precludes it.  That's the argument here - there's no reason to be paranoid about such slippery slopes because of the second amendment.  It provides a framework for which reasonable control measures can be put into place while excluding the possibility of confiscation.  I know it's a common thread in conspiracy circles, but that's what I was alluding to when I said "not all gun owners are delusional."Why not both?  It's not like winning the recall means she won't be up in 2016 still.  No, religious insecurity is exactly that - insecurity.  That's why "doubt" is such a common thread in modernist and postmodernist theology.  Eg, finding the allegorical role of God in a post-God world.  &gt;Naturalism. 
  
I hate to tell you this, but you just traded one structuralist framework for a different one then.  Perhaps you traded up, but I'd argue this is little epistemological difference between naturalism and theology.  
  
You see, Kierkegaard was right - the ultimate question is one of nihilism versus religion.  And religion doesn't make any sense, so... Nothing really matters and nothing useful is actually knowable to our narcissistic monkey brains.  
  
I actually came back full circle on dualism myself, after going through a similar line of reasoning in my 20s.  Except I acknowledge the ultimate "truth" of skepticism/nihilism, but figure that utilitarianism is a pretty fun game as long as I have to function in society.  Still, casting aside my old biases against nihilism was quite liberating, I must say.  It's because Kierkegaard was right.  The world does exist as a superposition of nihilism and structuralism, and nihilism is not very uplifting, so most people go with structuralism.  Even though deep down, they know that they really are just insignificant specs of entropy floating through ethically indifferent spacetime.  No, I absolutely agree.  Or rather, I don't disagree, or particularly care... but I also agree too.  
  
I'm going to go play video games.I'm really happy for you, and ima let you finish, but David Hume had one of the best singles of *all time.*Yeah, there's some hand waving there because I'm not trying to write a whole essay on my cell phone.  The point is that both positions fail (in my view) in their epistemological basis, because it becomes irreducible rather quickly - into something resembling a trivial proposition.  So they (theology and naturalism) become essentially the same proposition when deconstructed.  That is to say, all metaphysics inherently implies an epistemology of some sort (and indeed, vice versa).  So if we reject the epistemological basis, we can also reject any subsequent metaphysics which extend from it.  At the very least we can identify that these lines of reasoning are inherently circular to some degree.
  
  Which is why I make the jump to nihilism.  Skeptics tend to see the existential and epistemological link as implied to some degree, so there's not necessarily a need to hash it out in every discussion.  Once again, in my view.  That's why I love to say that Kant and Foucault were idiots and it was actually Kierkegaard who was correct.  This really wads panties in modernist circles, and I find that amusing.  Especially among those who try to reject nihilism only because they find it repulsive, and then build their mental gymnastics from that conjecture.  You don't even need to acknowledge that there is any ultimate question in the first place.  That's why I put "truth" in quotes.  My contention is that as soon as you start asking such questions, you've made the same fundamental error as religion does.  You don't "not know" at all if there is no question to begin with.   Chomsky bashes Democratics quite frequently as well, and has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration.  He's quite anti-establishment in general.  In this case, he's pointing out the obvious though.  Both parties have their flaws, but the GOP in particular has generally stopped participating in good will.  
  
They are at the point where Jeb Bush will go on television and basically say "Donald Trump represents a real and present danger to the sanctity of Western Democracy, but he's still better than Hillary Clinton."  
  
The implication being that vilifying Democrats and getting an (R) in office is more important than good will Democracy.  It's a truly terrifying narrative.  And it really is reminiscent of fascism.  The initial plan was likely to have the Trump circus distract from the Jeb circus.  But this has backfired as it has brought the fascism simmering below the surface of the GOP to the forefront.  The entire thing has Karl Rove written all over it, and its no surprise he's been making the rounds in the media the past couple of weeks running damage control.  
  
 Now they find themselves in the uncomfortable position that Trump is likely to get the nomination and is arguably their most viable candidate, no matter how much ridiculous BS they have him spew in an attempt to dampen his poll numbers.  At this point, he will have to call for something like gun confiscation before the GOP base will abandon him, and doing that would discredit the whole party.  If Trump is a secret liberal, we will know when he decides to run as a third party before primary season even launches
  
My biggest fear is that the younger millennials are so cynical, that they will stay home if Sanders doesn't get the nomination, which could pave the way for a Trump or Carson presidency.There is no legal obligation for them to endorse the "nominee" as far as I know.  I'd call it an opportunity to add due process to the no fly list as opposed to an opportunity to remove due process from gun eligibility.  
  
Your point, incidentally, is also why the entire "mental health" narrative doesn't hold water either.  Are we planning to deny mental health patients access to guns before they have committed a crime?  What happens when the constitution conflicts with the bible then?  And the idea is to have them refuel in the air after takeoff.I'd argue you could say the exact same thing about terrorists and enemies of the state.  The fact of the matter is that both cases distill down to removing constitutional rights absent due process.  The question ultimately being, where do we draw the line on that qualification.I agree - I'd love a comprehensive, nationalized mental healthcare system.  Unfortunately that seems diametrically opposed to everything the GOP stands for, ever since Reagan dismantled most such facilities in the 80s.  Since then, nothing they have done leads me to believe that they have an intention of implementing such a system.  Therefore the only possibility left is that it's shallow lip service.When did Salon swing so hard to the right?Don't ever visit /r/conspiracy then.  That's one of their favorite circlejerks.  Pics or it didnt happen.Shocking that everyone involved would have enough respect to not publish pictures of slaughtered dead 12 year olds.  Unfortunately, we can't say the same about your average conspiritard.  And you probably wonder why people don't take you seriously.It was sealed.  The landlord literally opened the door with a crowbar.  White people.Shit, anything short of having an addition added, or a roof installed, in doing the work myself.  Electrical, plumbing, low voltage, remodels - it's not rocket science, and I like the piece of mind knowing it's done correctly.  
  
\#TrustFundProblemsWe had a cat die from acute invasive fungal sinusitis after living in a shitty apartment with a mold problem for 3 years.  Poor thing was always sort of wheezy but basically stopped eating one day, stopped moving two days later, and died the next night at the vet while undergoing tests.  5 days from looking healthy to being dead.  The vet said she probably had early leukemia which shut her immune system down and finally allowed the mold to get a foot hold. After that it took about a week to reach her brain.  We moved out 3 days later.  No judgement here.  I'm fortunate because my father-in-law is a retired plumber, and I'm an electrical engineer, so I've got the two major skilled trades covered for the most part.  
  
I agree with you though - I've seen signs of shoddy work from the previous homeowner in my house.  The piece of 220v MC cable which connects to my oven had the wrong terminator and no anti-short guard, and both hot wires were nicked when I pulled the oven out.  There are coax splitters behind drywall which are (were) completely inaccessible.  The basement insulation is installed upside down (lol).  
  
But yeah, I wouldn't trust other homeowners, or contractors, and especially not handy men.  But part of that is also because I'm not willing to pay $100/hr for high quality contract labor, haha.  Really, what it comes down to is that I'm going to do the research anyway so I could inspect the work afterwards, and at that point, I might as well tackle most things myself.  Naturalism and empiricism absolutely works inside of a structuralist bubble.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying we should stop doing science or that science doesn't provide utility  or anything like that (source: am scientist).  But at the same time, naturalism is not mutually exclusive from theology either.  Christian dogma might be so, MORE than others, but you can easily build some generically imperative realist framework which permits both.  This was Kant's whole transcendental schtick.  
  
The issue though, is that you become inherently limited to whatever bubble you initially define as knowable.  Which is OK, but it's also perfectly valid to wonder what happens if we pop the bubble.  It's about how to deal with such unknown unknowns.  Most naturalists would say that it doesn't matter, or that we can't know, which is exactly the point.  That's the metaphysical nihilism.  
  
Think about it this way - our universe, as far as we know, exists the way it does because we are floating through some region of quantum field stability.  Its only because of this stability, our science and empiricism is functional.  However, its possible for a universe to exist in a different region of stability, or without stability at all. But these concepts, however obvious, are inherently unknowable to the naturalist.  We can describe them within our own empirical framework, but we can't know for sure if they are actually correct, or if they are merely a byproduct of extrapolating our own existence onto other possible existences.  This drives physicists nuts, because the deeper we look for empirical meaning in our own universe, the more likely it becomes that our conclusions are merely synthetic, as we approach the boundaries of our empirical bubble.  So naturalism is fine, as long as you acknowledge that it is inherently limited by some perhaps unknowable boundary conditions.  This is idiotic. Rooting for a civil war?  It's just as delusional as the FEMA camp bullshit on the right.  $25/hr isn't that great.  It's good, but it's not what people are talking about here, I'm guessing.  Lots of people working shitty office jobs are already making $25/hr.LolrefsI thought we'd decided against doing this.  Pretty sure he's done fine though.  thankA skeleton wouldn't be able to do that.  You'd need muscles too.Looks like skeleton breadFuck this season.Also, fuck the sidebar bet.  Shit is cursed.  If I'm Ozzy, from this point forward, I'm putting clauses in all player contracts with penalties if they have kids during the season.  Skeleton doesn't have musclesThere's always money in the banana stand Aborted hookers.He had a kid this season.  I'd be interested to see statistics on if there is a performance dip when this happens, because it sure feels like it.  My dog got into some edibles that my idiot room mate left in his reach.  It was sort of amusing once we figured out what happened.  He basically acted super drunk - couldn't walk in a straight line and was clearly tripping balls.  Tail was wagging the whole time though.  He sort of seemed to enjoy it.Not that I'm defending it, but most dogs will leave the room if they don't like it.  Lots seem to "ask" for it though.  I've definitely had both kinds of dogs.  The people that hold their dogs down and force it on them are scum though.  It will also save you a shit ton of money in tests.  No thread is safe!Are you shitting with me?  This was literally the most frequent obvious "joke" people made when that happened.  Yeah, what kind of pleb buys groceries at Wal Mart?&gt;$184, 22lbs. 
  
Shit, 4 pounds of USDA Prime Rib roast costs that much.You spend $2k on ammo in an afternoon?  That's like boat money.Not signing Miller was probably the worst Angelosism of the last 5 years.  The dude basically willed us to ALCS berth and we let him walk because we're too cheap to pay for top tier pitching talent.  I'd understand if we went out and signed a top tier starter instead, but... Lol.  Losing those close games in 7/8/9 was the difference between last year and the previous two years.  Miller absolutely could have changed that.
  
I'm getting a bit frustrated.  It sure looks like we're back to our old tricks, where Angelos simply won't pay for a team which can win in this league, and is just hoping for lightening to strike or something.  He wants to operate the team at profit instead of operating to win.  It's a vicious cycle, and we've seen this before.  
He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do.We will see.  I have this nightmare that O'Day isn't going to be a long term solution though.  The numbers for guys who throw in the low 80's just aren't that great, and I'm afraid that he's going to get exposed at some point and then it's all going to be over.  That's what I mean by lightning striking - you can't build a team on players who inexplicably over-perform. At some point you need conventional talent or the team will revert to the norm.  
  
Trust me, I really hope I am wrong about all this, but I just can't help but be concerned.I've got a throbbing whinge right now.&gt;and in a game where people work so hard to actually get their ships in the first place  
  
Yeah, I know a lot of people want the game to be EVE-anarchy style, but fuck that noise.  That's the surest way to make sure this game massively fails.  As someone who might get 10 hours a month to put into gaming, I will simply rage quit if I have all of my progress lost because some asshole who plays 40 hours a week gets bored and want to troll me.  Yup, this is what I fear as well, especially since the Goons appear to have an increasingly large influence in SC these days, and are quite open about their intentions to exploit the shit out of the game in whatever way possible.  
  
I think the solution might be to have bounties apply to entire Orgs instead of just players so Org members can't just claim bounties off each other, and will ultimately find themselves in a position where the entire org becomes nonviable because they can barely log in without being hunted by the UEE.  If they misbehave enough, that is.  So maybe it starts out that bounties are distributed 99% to 1% players to org, and as the proportion of people in the org with bounties increases, each individual act earns the entire org a larger bounty.  Very much like how it works in real life to some degree - nobody even cares about individual ISIS members these days.  It's all about destroying their organization and everything they stand for.  On the other hand, Somali Pirates are very much seen as individual criminals because they don't all fly the same flag.  
  
It would also give powerful orgs incentive to recruit well-behaved players, which in turn, gives individual players incentive to behave and play earnestly.The problem is that attempting to exploit the "fantasy" nature of the game in order to grief completely breaks the entire "space sim" part of the experience, in my opinion.  In real life, there is a finite supply of desperate idiots and equipment available for suicide missions, etc.  And those that will do such things, aren't just doing it "for the lulz."  It's much harder to convince people to go actually die for some intangible cause than it is to convince some bored 15 year old with lots of free time that it will be funny to troll new players for several hours.  This is the surest way to make sure SC gets a bad reputation, and could very well kill the entire concept of AAA crowd sourced development if SC ultimately fails in balanced world building.
  
In the virtual world, the only consequence is time.  You can keep respawning in some capacity, so each suicide griefer isn't just eliminated from the universe once they get blown up - they can just continuously re-roll on alt accounts and make life miserable for roleplayers and casual pilots.  This is distinct from players who are actually roleplaying chaotic/evil toons, because these players can't just ignore the consequences of their actions inside the lore.  It's not that the community has a fear of non-consensual PVP, it's that many in the community don't want to see the game turn into EVE 3D where it is basically impossible to play solo, and the game often feels like a job and a burden.   This is one of the reason why I think a lot of the debate about KBM vs HOTAS is premature.  Because once there is more tactical and strategic depth to the game, I think we are going to see individual combinations of control schemes and play styles become much less broadly dominant in general.  
   
For example, more powerful fixed weapons are going to be preferred for hitting "above your weight," but are always going to be somewhat less useful for dogfighting against nimble targets.  So a group of fighters attacking a Connie or Tali are definitely going to load out with fixed guns.  But at the same time, maneuverability and flight tactics are going to be extremely important in this role to avoid ship defenses and escorts, and HOTAS is going to reign supreme here.  On the other hand, if you are the one escorting the larger ship, gimbal weapons are going to be better for creating suppressive fields of fire and maneuvering is going to be less important, so KBM is going to have the upper hand for this role.  Similarly, you are never going to hire a KBM pilot to fly your Idris, or do your power management, and you are never going to hire a joystick gunner to man your turrets.  
  
I think what will eventually happen is that your "General purpose" SC battlestation for hardcore players is going to end up having both a HOTAS and a mouse, and a keyboard, and head tracking, and VR available, and part of being a skilled player is going to be be mastering each control style, as well as being able to switch between them seamlessly as the need arises. Of course - it's all about balancing the carrots and the sticks.  I suspect that there will definitely be some advantages conveyed for associating with an org in-game.  Like the ability to easily share resources and intelligence.  
  
Sure, players can probably organize in an external IRC, but then their ability to run EW and do things like have forward forces paint targets for protected missle boats will be limited to squad/parties.  Whereas if they are org members, there might be the ability to run these kind of tactics at a much larger scale, between squads and parties.  Same thing with jump point access.  An org could have entire scouting parties dedicated to tracking jump points in ways which wouldn't be practical just using external chats.  
  
At least, this is the kind of depth I hope the game eventually has.Like I said in another comment, this can be somewhat controlled by granting distinct advantages for being part of an org in-game.  Orgs shouldn't just be a superficial window dressing - there should be carrots which will make it very difficult to do any real force projection, or large scale tactical coordination if you are not org-affiliated in-game.  Yeah, I have read Moneyball.  It's a great book, but I think one of the pieces of subtext that people miss about it is that it describes a functional outlier, by definition.  It's entire novelty is that it wasn't supposed to work - it was the very definition of a flash in the pan - and it was only successful *because* nobody had taken that approach before.  Now every GM rolls these techniques into their scouting and team management, so it is much harder to squeeze statistical value out this strategy nowadays.  
  
It's like the Tampa-Two or the spread offense in football.  When they first appeared on the scene, they changed the way the game was played, and granted teams a massive strategic advantage.  Until everyone else caught on.  Now, everyone is rolling these techniques into their larger strategy, and running a base spread offense circa 2001 is seen as too vanilla to succeed.  
  
That's where the strategic flaw is here - once any one tactic becomes overly dominant, teams will devote increasingly large amounts of effort to countering it, and once that happens, leaning on it too heavily will become a losing strategy.  I think that's why, eg Jim Johnson's stats seem to be inversely aligned with the success of the team he is on.  He was a world beater when the Orioles weren't very good, but once he became a legitimate threat to the AL pecking order, people actually scouted him, and his stats reverted back to the norm.  I fear that the same thing could happen to O'Day (or any submariner) as well.     Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.Language is fungible.  It's a rifle, so we've got that part covered.  And the ergonomics and configuration of the weapon arguably lends itself to offensive or "assault" scenarios in that it is a carbine with a pistol grip, a short stock, and a magazine fed, gas actuated receiver which accommodates a wide range of tactical attachments.  It definitely seems designed specifically for rapid acquisition and engagement of multiple targets at medium to long range, with secondary consideration given to it's unitary stopping power, as would be favored during offensive maneuvers.  In fact, "select fire" alone seems like a rather poor criteria to delineate "assault weapons" since it doesn't seem like it would really add much benefit to the role by itself.  If you took a 4 foot long bull-barrel hunting rifle and added a select fire receiver to it, it would still be pretty impractical as an agile offensive weapon.  I'm sort of interested to know exactly who decided that the line is drawn at the select fire mechanism.
  
Further, while it can be used for defense or hunting, it's not particularly suited for either due to the penetration and kinetic characteristics of the 5.56 round.  For both of these things, you are more concerned with single-shot stopping power, so an AR-15 is probably not the best choice.  A .45 pistol round will just about take your shoulder clean off at close range, whereas a shoulder shot from an AR15 is likely to pass through the meaty bits without nearly as much trauma.
  
This entire discussion just feels pedantic to me. Like saying an M3 is a "family sedan" instead of a sports car, because it has 4 doors and a trunk.  "Sports car" isn't singularly defined as a car with a forced induction system, or one which has a certain performance metric - it's the broad capability of a car which is specifically oriented towards racing performance based on the combination of it's engine, suspension, driving dynamics, brakes, etc.  That's just how language works... except, apparently, in the case of assault rifles, which are apparently demarcated by a very specific, capability which honestly seems to have little alignment with the actual definition of the word "assault" or the features which one would desire in a weapon designed for that purpose.  A Civic Si or a GTi is frequently considered a "sports car" though.  In that they are specifically outfitted for performance.  Just as an AR-15 is arguably designed more for "assault" than it is for hunting or close quarters defense.   
  
More to the point, I think you actually bring up a good point about the linguistics involved.  What defines a "sports car" anyway?  It's definitely not some singular mechanical requirement.  It's more about the broader picture of how the car is designed, what it does, and how it performs.  Saying "only cars with a turbocharger are sports cars" doesn't seem to capture the term very well.  
  
Similarly, "select fire" sort of seems like a poor way to define a weapon with "assault oriented" capabilities.  I mean, speaking of words meaning shit, how does "select fire" imply "assault" more than does a lightweight carbine with a pistol grip, short stock, and a gas cycled, magazine fed receiver with a wide array of tactical attachment points, which is perfectly suited to rapid engagement of multiple targets at medium to long range?  That seems to specifically imply a weapon which has been primarily designed with offensive purposes in mind, the same way a Computer with a specific kind of GPU, CPU, RAM and discrete, modular components implies a PC which has been designed for gaming, or a "gaming PC."  Nobody tries to pigeonhole the term "gaming" around any one specific mechanical feature of a GPP platform - *that* would be ignoring the definition of the word "gaming" more than seeing the term as a fungible summation of the broader design of the machine, and what it's intended usage is likely to be.I mean, "a short, agile, centerfire carbine specifically tailored towards offensive or assault roles and tactics" just doesn't roll off the tongue the same way, does it?  
  
Who even decided that select fire was the defining factor anyway?  That seems just as semantically silly as saying "only cars with synchromesh transmissions are sports cars."  I'm quite interested to know the etymology of this term.And perhaps a better definition for what constitutes a weapon oriented towards "assault" roles.Or maybe, just maybe, it's "rifle which is ergonomically and tactically suited for medium-to-long range offensive maneuvers" = assault rifle. But are they better for pig hunting than a bolt-action 5.56 rifle?  I mean, maybe if you are trying to take down the entire herd...  
  
&gt;Light, Accurate, Good Range  
  
My CZ 527 is lighter, more accurate, and has the same range... It just lacks a pistol grip, a semi-automatic receiver and rails.  Are we really trying to imply that the military prefers an expensive varmint gun for it's offensive infantry troops? I mean, in most places, hunting with a 5.56 rifle is actually illegal because it doesn't have the stopping power that larger caliber rifles do.  In my mind, the entire idea behind the AR15 is to be an agile carbine which can engage multiple targets at range, with more emphasis placed on incapacitation than single-shot stopping power (as would be preferred for point defense or hunting).  That does imply an "assault" role to me.So in the "spirit" of the word, it seems that if an AR15 can be turned into a True assault rifle with a $10 piece of metal, and a few commonly available tools - maybe it's close enough to fall somewhere on the same spectrum?I don't necessarily disagree with any of your points, but I also think there is just as much pedantry on the pro-gun side.  And I do own guns myself, and enjoy shooting them, and get peace of mind from having them around, since apparently that is salient for having my opinion on the topic matter.  
  
I think the entire debate is sort of missing the point though.  We do make a distinction between weapons which are and are not appropriate for civilian use, and I think the debate is over where that line is and how to define it.  I think there is just as much of an emotional response towards the AR15 platform on the pro-gun side as there is on the anti-gun side, in that it has become more of a symbolic issue than one of actual utility.  In terms of hunting, sporting and home defense, I think no utility would actually be lost by making the AR15 illegal.  I'm also not convinced entirely that this is sufficient grounds for banning the weapon, though I do lean slightly in that direction because the weapon does seem uniquely suited for offensive roles.  
  
I also think that just as the left likes to ignore the practical considerations here, the right also seems to view the AR15 as their favorite toy, more than as an actual tool for any specific purpose.  Again, because of the second amendment, that alone really doesn't make any difference in terms of whether it should be banned, but I think it does say something about about the quality of the rhetoric and the earnestness of the discussion on the pro-gun side.  Just as it says something about the quality of the anti-gun rhetoric. I'm just being pedantic here, but an M4 is nearly 2 pounds heavier than my CZ.  Not sure about length though.  I just think there is more than just the weight, and select fire capability which separates the utility of my favorite little range rifle, and a weapon uniquely suited for offensive tactics.  Still, it seems to say very little about it's utility in the home of an average citizen who has no need to engage enemy infantry at 300m.  I'm not saying that means it should be banned either, just that the select fire distinction, and how we define an assault role has somewhat different implications in the home than it does on the battle field.

We apologize for the inconvenience.High Quality Post.Today, on /r/worldnews.Time is going full IRL clickbait, I guess.Fucking Christ.  Here we go everyone.  I'm pretty terrified about what's going to happen moving forward.  If the GOP wins the election and holds all three branches, descent into fascism seems likely.  If the GOP loses, I'm even more terrified of an armed insurrection.  The GOP base seems prined for it - even itching for the prospect.  It's going to be an interesting decade, either way.  
  
But this has been bubbling below the surface of the GOP for a while.  I've been pointing it out long before we had Trump.  It's only been kept in check by party leaders who pander and deflect just enough by using other wedge issues like abortion and global warming denial.  That ship has clearly sailed though, and forcing out Boehner is starting to look like the tipping point here.  He's all but called for a crusade already.  Just watch - I bet he'll do exactly that before the primaries spin up.I've been saying this for at least two years.  This rhetoric is not new for the GOP - ita just much more overt now.  &gt;Fascism is best defined as a revolutionary form of nationalism, one that sets out to be a political, social and ethical revolution, welding the \u2018people\u2019 into a dynamic national community under new elites infused with heroic values. The core myth that inspires this project is that only a populist, trans-class movement of purifying, cathartic national rebirth (palingenesis) can stem the tide of decadence. 
  
Surely you must see the concerning parallels between the Jewish and the Muslim scapegoat.Exactly.

Because apparently this adds some kind of value to the site.  Are you trying to tell me that the evil SJWs *aren't* the greatest threat facing western Democracy?

I called Trump a fascist, quoted an academic description of fascism, and then you said "yeah, but he's nothing like Hitler."  I'm just responding to your comments at this point.  I never said Trump was going to gas Muslims.  I drew a parallel between the scapegoats which ushered in an era of extreme nationalism in Germany.  Fascism is not necessarily the holocaust.
  
If you are really so naive that you can't recognize terrifying right wing fanaticism which resembles a fascist movement when you see it, then I feel sorry for all of us.    Fascism is a political philosophy. It has no inherent connection with invading counties or exterminating races, at least not by any academic definition.  One fascist did that.  Or are we also going to also make the jump that Christianity necessarily implies crusades?  Or that Democracy implies invading Rome?You're all over the place.  The point is that Trump is exploiting xenophobic nationalism to nurture a populist movement of right wing extremism.  There are early parallels to classical fascism, and [I'm not the only one](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/opinion/campaign-stops/is-donald-trump-a-fascist.html) sounding this alarm.  Call it whatever you want, but the parallels are there, and it's terrifying nonetheless. There are definitely people who think a [civil war](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3vjsdj/noam_chomsky_the_gop_is_no_longer_a_normal/cxovoh3) is better than "not Bernie."&gt;assault weapons. 
  
Triggered!I think you meant to say "rifle which is ergonomically and functionally suited for offensive or assault roles," because these rifles don't have select fire, and words have definitions, damnit!  /sI think it's cute that they think we don't have guns.  More likely the Trump circus is supposed to be running interference for the Jeb circus.  Now they are trying to up his extremist rhetoric to trigger his fade, but it's all backfiring.There was actually a Russian scholar who called this after the last election.  Maybe Trump is working for the Russians.  Some of us did.  Some of us have been calling out the simmering fascism since the whole "birther movement" and the rise of the Tea Party.  The fact that they are rolling out Cheney to railroad Trump shows that their little diversion tactic has come off the rails.  
  
Now maybe if Jeb could bring himself to say that Hillary would be a better president than Trump, it would be a step back towards sanity.  Hillary can say whatever she wants, but unless she can get the second amendment repealed, it's not going to happen.  That's the beauty of the second amendment in my view - it puts us in a unique position to implement reasonable gun control with no threat of confiscation or guns being outlawed as long as our constitutional Democracy still stands.  You can literally ignore her if she says she wants to ban guns.  I sort of feel like there can't be any harm to an open PTU at this point.  Everyone knows it is buggy, and there will be a good amount of self selection among those who get frustrated and stop trying fairly quickly.  It's not like they are going to get bad press for a PTU patch.  I want my taste damnit!Does anyone know if Adam Sandler is available?&gt;Basketball. 
  
Advice from another short guy:  focus on math. Once upon a midnight dreary. 
While I pondered weak and weary...I'd argue that it's also a lack of insight and perspective stemming from a lack of a well rounded education and diversity of experience.  Just the act of going away to college kicks you in the pants and forces you out of your comfort zone to a large degree.    
  
It's not necessarily about taking English 101 - it's being forced to interact with a variety of people and having a variety of experiences which produces thoughtfulness and even empathy moreso than never leaving the insulation of your home town, and interacting with the same people day in and day out.  There's a reason they call University a "liberal education," and it has little to do with politics.Worst case scenario, you're the smartest guy in the NBA.Thank you for your submission!

If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) and include the link to the submission. We apologize for the inconvenience.You might want to review your assessment of .223/5.56 penetration: http://www.theboxotruth.com/the-box-o-truth-1-the-original-box-o-truth/  
  
To be honest, I had very similar thoughts.  Which is why I selected a 5.56 rifle over 7.62 as my utility rifle ([CZ 527](http://cz-usa.com/product/cz-527-carbine-223-rem/) - absolutely gorgeous gun) - I had read that 5.56 ball rounds should fragment through walls and not put my neighbor's kids at risk.  Based on other tests though, that might not be entirely accurate.  It turns out that expanding subsonic handgun rounds or turkey shot are probably the "safest" in terms of home defense.  And even that is iffy.  Drywall doesn't seem to do much of anything in terms of stopping bullets.  I then went out and got myself some .223 hollowpoint rounds thinking those would be safer, but it turns out those just tend to get filled with drywall/wood and don't expand unless they hit something fleshy.  They also tend to tumble and go off center through walls, so even if you are careful about shooting away from other people, deflected rounds could easily hit someone 45 degrees off-bore.
  
Along with that, there's also the problem that small supersonic rounds like .223 are somewhat more likely to go through and through at close range, and may not stop an intruder with a poor shot like a large caliber handgun or intermediate shotgun round will.  It's also *fucking loud* and bright.  You're likely to flashbang yourself firing them off in an enclosed space with no hearing protection.  There's a reason police and SWAT tend to prefer subsonic/pistol caliber carbines over supersonic rifles for breaching and clearing.  
  
Selection of home defense rounds aside - I feel much the same way about semiautomatic 7.62 carbines as I do about AR style rifles.  It's not any one feature of the weapon I have issue with - it's the notion that these guns are largely designed for offensive tactics from the ground up.  I think that represents a bit of a problem, and there are *many* other options which meet the needs for hunting/defense, which don't also carry that implication.  You are exceedingly unlikely to find yourself in a shootout with a home invader, unless you are a some kind of organized crime goon.  You are never going to be laying down suppression fire at 200m because some junkie wants your Xbox.  
  
Again, I'm not sure how that translates to regulation, but I think all of these points are important to acknowledge.  I personally think there is a middle ground here which permits people to own these kinds of weapons, without making them too widely available, or dare I say - massaging the sort of paranoia which has fostered their startling proliferation.  I think something like a properly implemented "may issue" program at the federal level might be a good compromise.  Something where you must obtain a security clearance level background check, with interviews, range training, semi-yearly classes, tests and a demonstration of proficiency, and yes - even a registry.  This way we can implement carrots and sticks which encourage people to seek out other weapons for defense/hunting, while still allowing people who treat these weapons with the respect they deserve to own them.  
  
The problem with this is that being an "AR enthusiast" seems to go hand in hand with being highly suspicious of any government regulation whatsoever.  I do sympathize, but it's something we need to move past.  The sentiment seems to be on par with - for lack of a better example - taking a child's toy away. That restricting the sale of offensive-oriented weapons is one small step away from banning guns entirely.  I acknowledge that this might not be entirely fair, but no matter how you feel about ARs, you have to admit that this does not exactly follow.  My view is that the second amendment is brilliant, not because it guarantees everyone can own any gun without oversight, but rather it creates a framework by which we can implement and experiment with different forms of gun control *without* the risk of seeing guns banned or confiscated.  We can, for example, implement universal background checks, and a registry which will help prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals, and as long as our constitutional republic stands, there is no risk of this being abused for confiscation purposes.

We apologize for the inconvenience.I'm don't really have anything else to add to this discussion because we seem to have reached somewhat of an impasse here.  
  
However I do want to say that the picture in that first article is quite amusing, as it perfectly captures the stereotype of the tacticool armchair warrior, stealthily stalking his suburban prey from behind the cover of his living room furniture, ready to fire off-balance at the knees of the junkie inspecting his television, at a range of 6 feet, seemingly unaware of the irony that he won't be able to make an insurance claim on said television if it has a bullet hole in it like he would if it was just stolen. =PBasically, you can assume that any supplier who doesn't specifically address the concerns over diacetyl is probably using it in any "buttery/breakfast" flavor.  Even some of the "nutty" tobacco flavors frequently have it.  
  
There are vendors who will go out of their way to state that they do not use these ingredients, but most of these individuals are small-time, "premium" vendors.  Your best bet is to email the seller and ask about it before making a purchase.It's also possible that the opposite is True as well though diacetyl might decompose into something completely safe when heated.  Unlikely, but possible - we won't know until more research is done.  What we do know, is that ecigs are probably the single most effective risk-reduction/smoking cessation product we have available.  Just send them an email asking if they use diacetyl in any of their flavors.  Honestly, most of the vendors who don't use it state as such right on their website.  At the moment, it is technically derived from tobacco plant extraction.  It doesn't need to be though - the industry is one GMO eggplant away from ending the association entirely - they just haven't gotten there yet.  Part of me thinks that they are waiting to see how the regulation plays out, because if they announced today that they are extracting nicotine from eggplants, it's possible that eggplants will just get rolled into this round of regulation.This is exactly why so many people are uneasy about concealed and open carry - there are lots of idiots out there, and the more widespread this movement becomes, the more idiots there will be carrying guns around.This is exactly why "duty to retreat" has long been foundational in self defense law.  Because it makes it clear that you have no right to escalate or draw out such a situation simply because you know you are armed.  It clears up a lot of these hypothetical situations people are discussing.  
  
A lot of this also highlights why carrying is not always the greatest idea.  If someone throws a punch, you probably shouldn't shoot them in most cases.  But the situation becomes complicated if, eg, the fight goes to the ground.  It's also the reason why carrying creates just as many problems as it solves.  Most physical altercations end without more than some bruises and a black eye.  Especially if you are avoiding escalation and making efforts to retreat, instead of beating your chest and refusing to back down.  Situations where an attacker is persistent in threatening your well-being are rare.  And even then - do you shoot someone to avoid a broken nose?  Because you've been disrespected?  To protect the $20 bill in your wallet?
   
The fact of the matter is that most people can't even be trusted to drive a car safely, much less manage a deadly weapon responsibly.  And the more people there are open carrying, the more potential there are for over reaction and flaring tempers to escalate situations unnecessarily.  I think too many people treat carrying as a game - as a manifestation of their own insecurities.  Too many people do not think rationally about whether they really need to bring a gun to the supermarket or a school board meeting.  The guy in the OP risked far more just getting into a car than he would have risked by leaving his gun at home.  I think this is a risk calculation far too many people fail to weigh.And this kind of thing will become more and more common as more and more people walk around with this fantasy that they are living in the wild west.  I really wish more gun owners would consider this, and how truly pointless carrying a weapon around everywhere really is in almost every case.  The risk calculus just doesn't add up, and being petulant about it isn't going to win you many friends.  
  
Insisting you need to carry a gun with you to your suburban grocery store "because you can" is a pretty childish attitude if you ask me.  It's like insisting you need to bring a personal floatation device with you to the company barbecue in case the building floods.  It's just that nobody is enamoured empowered by PFDs, or particularly emotional about the possibility of unexpected flooding.  Like it or not, people ignore far bigger risks on a daily basis than they would by leaving their weapon at home.Agreed.  I have no problem with castle doctrine in most cases, but I think extending that to other areas is frequently problematic for many, many reasons.  It's actually the fourth largest metro area in the country.  Also the most educated and highest income, but it does it quietly.  Nobody thinks of Baltimore as a wealth or educational powerhouse.It's not quite as crazy as it seems (though it's still clearly pretty crazy).  Maryland as a state votes about 70% Democrat in presidential elections.  Some of the districting is clearly done for self preservation, but having the state go 50/50 for Congress doesn't quite make much sense either.I still think this has Rove's fingerprints all over it.  The plan was to have Trump distract from Jeb, but Trump is going rogue and its coming off the rails.  
   
Or maybe not. Notice how reasonable much of the GOP sounds today, now that they are falling over themselves to condemn Fuhrer Trump.  It makes them look downright moderate.It astounded unskewed and RCP readers.  Everyone else who had been following the election pretty much knew we were headed towards a landslide.  Unskew those polls!The reality hasn't sunk in yet.  And Democrats arguably don't need the young reactionary demographic in this election.  If Virginia goes blue, and it almost certainly will,  very nearly all of the other swing states can go red (Florida won't) and there's almost no map which produces a GOP victory.  You're seeing the voice of maybe a few hundred loud supporters.  Do not mistake reddit for a representative sample.Indeed.  They've even woken Darth Cheney from his sleep.  
  
Or maybe giving all the establishment Republicans a punching bag was the whole plan.  What better way to pivot the base back towards the middle, short of an inside villain?  The optimist in me wants to believe he's the catalyst being used to swing the party back to the middle.  Don't worry, the world will make much more sense when you turn 18.Now Skeeter.

Edit - Wow, and this guy has a 5 day old account.  So brave.  It's amazing how eerily similar the Koch Industries commericals are to the Veridian dynamics commercials.Because then they can't say "look, our clean Diesel technology is more powerful and more fuel efficient than a hybrid for less money!"  It completely defeats the appeal of those models. Not to mention, you occasionally see A-list US actors doing hilariously shitty European commercials which never air in the US.  That alone is worth the price of admission.is /r/news considered low hanging fruit yet?There's a bit more context though, which people like to ignore.  Both Baltimore and Cleveland had NFL teams moved on them.  The difference is that the Colts took the entire team history with them, so now it says "Indianapolis Colts" for all the OG Colts records in the Football Hall of fame.  Then, after the team literally snuck out of town one night without letting anyone know, the league passed up Baltimore for two expansions so they could give Florida a third team.  
  
In Cleveland, the NFL backed a lawsuit to keep the Browns' history in Cleveland, and then gave them money for a new stadium, and then accelerated expansion plans specifically so the city could have a new team in 3 years.  The Browns knew exactly when they would see football again before the vans even left.
  
So yeah, there's bad blood, and Baltimore fans like to poke fun at the Cleveland whiners who they feel got got off pretty easy.  That's why they are so touchy about it. ESPN's entire thing is subtly shitting on small market teams while jerking off the large market teams which have the most viewers.  It's their way of teaching the controversy to keep people hooked.Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

We apologize for the inconvenience.100% Agreed.  Get out ahead of this now.  Otherwise it will just be like the streamers all over again, complete with sob stories, giveaways and every other excuse under the sun to spam the sub with low-effort fluff.I would say limit this to comments only.  Or have a weekly sticky thread for referral codes.  For two reasons:  
  
1) We don't need low-effort referral requests filling up the sub.  
  
2) People will just make fake "request" threads and use it as cover to spam their own codes.  
  
Call my a cynic, but I've spent enough time as a mod on other subs to know that users come up with all sorts of very creative ways of gaming the system, seemingly for no reason besides the thrill of finding spam loopholes.  As if the very existence of rules is an affront to their better sensibilities.  
  
My concern is that a person will make an alt, make a fake thread requesting referral codes, and then use the thread to post their own code.  Or they will have org members make the thread so they can spam codes.  This is exactly what the streamers and org recruiters used to do before the sub cracked down on this.

Report about to come out "srsly guise, the Dutch are just biased."While I don't entirely disagree with your assessment, keep in mind that we are discussing the non-classified capabilities of a brand new weapons system here.  The Zumwalts are likely somewhat more capable than we are aware of.  The platform is also likely planned around testing/developing future capabilities to some degree.  The way I have always viewed the program is as a starting point for ongoing DDG/hybrid platform development.  Let's be honest, the current capabilities of the A-B flight 2/3 Destroyers are already quite advanced compared to any foreseeable threat.  They currently field (arguably) the most advanced ABM and electronics/radar suite of any vehicle in the world, and we know we can crank them out like hotcakes if necessary.  With the newest A-B kit, the USN isn't exactly hurting for credible fleet-area defense like they were even 5 or 6 years ago.   
  
The DDG-1000 program is just a starting point for *potential* DDG evolution moving forward - rather than building 10 new AB destroyers, they are building 3 test platforms which will get everyone up to speed in terms of hull construction, systems integration and crew training.  This way, they can spend the next 10 years refining the designs and systems, and figuring out what does and doesn't work, so by the time China or Russia poses a realistic threat to the current fleet, there will be established TR7 systems ready for mass production.  What that mass production ultimately looks like might be very different though - we could very well see an ABM/fleet defense variant, or a smaller littoral variant, or a dedicated laser destroyer, etc.  It's hard to say for sure exactly what is planned, but I think it's not a terrible idea to try to stay one step ahead.  
  
The point is, when you are already out of sight of the next closest competition, you have a bit of freedom to experiment and try new radical things.  Not only does this give the US a head start in terms of next-get ship building logistics, it forces China to spend energy considering future threats (threats which may never even exist) rather than focusing all their energy on how to kill A-B destroyers.  Fog of war, and whatnot.It's both.  There is definitely plain old thermal damage as well.  I can't cook an egg on the sidewalk because of cell apoptosis - the sun provides more than enough IR flux at the earth's surface to damage exposed skin, in addition to the UV damage.  &gt;Rear window visibility.  
  
I'm not sure what you mean.  The rear window is just as large, and I love the fact that my rear bumper only extends ~5 inches from the window.  It makes parallel parking super easy.In addition to what everyone else said, having romex just sitting flush at the bottom of the cabinet like that seems like a bad idea.  Not only is it the first place water will pool if anything goes bad with the sink or dish washer, the box and wires also obstruct access to the space.  If you ever have to disassemble the trap, or unclog the disposal, you *will* have water draining into that area - you are going to have a drain pan literally sitting on top of romex, inches from the switch.  I'm not an expert on code, but I'm pretty sure you are supposed to at least have a drip loop on each side of the switch - that's best practice if it isn't code. 
  
Honestly, if I was a plumber and I was called out to work under there, I would probably refuse until the switch was relocated.  It's also going to send up a huge red flag for the inspector if you ever sell the house, and will make people wonder what other things you have DIY'd.  
  
But to answer your question - yes, that circuit should be 100% GFCI'd, and I'd personally feel much safer if that was a 2 pole switch.  &gt;brillo pad  
  
I guarantee you that if you read the care instructions, they specifically tell you *not* to do this.  Not only is the brillo pad far too abrasive itself, is has an embedded cleaner which is both caustic and abrasive.  That's the worst possible combination for a glass-ceramic surface.  While glass alone is very scratch resistant and non-reactive, the ceramic matrix suspension makes it significantly softer and prone to etching.   
  
Generally, that glass looks extremely scuffed up for a stovetop which is less than a year old.  The one we have is 8 years old and is still like a mirror in all but a few places (where I splashed some syrup onto a hot eye and etched it).  You really need to be careful about using anything caustic or abrasive on these surfaces - that means no bleach, no vinegar - not even the rough side of standard kitchen sponge.  
  
The good news is that you might be able to restore the scuffed surface to some degree of luster by using a mild rubbing compound or rouge, or even a baking soda slurry.  That's what the purpose made glass stove cleaners actually are - a very mild rubbing compound with a surfactant and grease cutting base.  Thank you for your submission!

&gt;Purely mechanical limited-slip diffs are reactive. That is, they don't begin to lock up until after wheelslip has occurred.  
  
This is misleading - depending on the design, the differential operates with a continuous torque-biasing curve.  It's not binary "open or locked" - it *always* limits the maximum torque differential across the half shafts up to the mechanical biasing ratio.  It doesn't kick in and lock once that threshold is exceeded, it begins to bias torque as soon as there is any difference across the half shafts, and locks fully once the threshold is exceeded. So if there is a 55:45 torque split across the differential, and the threshold ratio is 2:1, you will end up with roughly a 52.5:47.5 split at the output, and so on until you are at the 66:33 maximum bias, and the differential is "locked" (it's never actually "locked though" - angular velocity of the shafts can still differ.)   It's a subtle but important difference, because as you load the diff in a corner, it slowly starts to pull the car into the arc as it biases the torque *before* the outside wheel spins, until the diff fully locks.  If it was binary like this suggests, it would snap the car rather violently into the corner when the diff goes from open to l
