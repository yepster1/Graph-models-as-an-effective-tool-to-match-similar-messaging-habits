 All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. So we may only have 5 weeks left !!!  We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.  Chow,   Geof 
 I agree with your statements on phase II. I'll start working on the priorities and requirements.  Also, what is the status of Colleen?  Geof 
 I have to pay $25 because I forgot what my score was?  I'm not asking for an official copy to be sent to a school. I don't need some fancy transcipt that I can hand to someone. I was just curious what my scores were.  I paid for the test once and I'm not paying again.  Great customer service. 
 We need to have a meeting regarding version 3.  Let me know when you have time? I dont want a 10 person meeting. Just you and myself.  geof 
 thats fine. come to my desk or 32c2. i have a meeting there at 3pm. 
 sign me up please, thank you very very much  geof 
 No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone.  While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type for basis options.

  Todd Esay called and still wants to book out some power deals. I refered him to Ed Sacks. BUT, I want to hold off on the book outs and tell him we'll do them if they agree to a credit ring (will bring in cash) on the gas side. Bill would need to call Sempra credit to verify our total exposure. Can we talk to them about this???? Please let Bill know.   geof 
 Please call Sempra credit and explain the credit ring out.

 Patrick,  We would. I am just trying to put together a few counterparties. I will be emailing or calling you latter today.  Thanks,  Geof 
   Steve,  As per your discussions with Bill Bradford I am working on reducing your physical risk to Enron.  I am talking with several counterparties on ringing out your positions. Can you give me your phone number so we can discuss this or give me a call at 713-853-7058.  Thanks,  Geof Storey Director Trading 
 was this just gas? or gas and power? 
 Any idea how power looks? 
 The confirms look good. Send them with Exhibit A and have them return signed copies that include Exhibit B, which will be a copy of the confirm b/w BMO and Reliant.  Call me if you have any questions.  Geof 3-7058 
 Randall,  I have a few structures to propose:  ENA sells to Bank of America             500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1 ENA buys from Williams                     500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1 Williams buys from Bank of America    500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1  or  ENA sells to Bank of America             250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1 ENA buys from Williams                     250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1 Williams buys from Bank of America    250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1  Either set of trades takes off $60million of exposure and flattens our total nymex swap positions. The latter fits the term structure of our positions better, but the former may fit our credit positions better.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks,  Geof Storey 713-853-7058 
 I have talked with them about phys rings. But the primary counterparty i was going to use was Dynegy. The trading wanted to make some money to do the deal, but i'm not sure where we stand with the other Dynegy stuff going on. So i'm on a holding pattern with Mirant unless you have any suggestions. geof 
 where's my recruiters? 
 clock's ticking 
 Are we doing ATM rings for Sempra and Kinder? Or others? Presto said he's refusing to do it in power for anybody. Any advice, cause the phone is ringing off the hook to do them. 
 Did you say you had a friend that has private health insurance. if so who with? and any advice?

  Larry,  Sorry I haven't contacted you in awhile with regard to the probate list of assets. We will be disclaiming various Life Insurance and JROS accounts.

When the disclaiming process is done, she can coordinate with you the final list of probate assets so you can finish the court work.  Let me know if you have any questions.

  Those idiots. I was in a hurry and didn't want to miss my flight, so i walked out and assumed that they would just bill the credit card.  But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, "Okay" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said "no problem".  Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.  Geof 
 Hey dork! What time does the flight arrive????? Cameron wants to see you!!!!!
