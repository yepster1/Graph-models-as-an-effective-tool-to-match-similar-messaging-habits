 I forgot what my GMAT's were? How do i find out what my scores were?  Geoffrey Clinton Storey 713-853-7058 
 She is still stuck in bed. But she will be going off her medication this week or next. Should be off bed rest also in the next week. I he doesn't come on his own by th efirst week in may, than they will take him out.  That's the news. I'll be a daddy before you know it !!!!!!   geof 
 All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. So we may only have 5 weeks left !!!  We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.  Chow,   Geof 
 I agree with your statements on phase II. I'll start working on the priorities and requirements.  Also, what is the status of Colleen?  Geof 
 I have to pay $25 because I forgot what my score was?  I'm not asking for an official copy to be sent to a school. I don't need some fancy transcipt that I can hand to someone. I was just curious what my scores were.  I paid for the test once and I'm not paying again.  Great customer service.

 thats fine. come to my desk or 32c2. i have a meeting there at 3pm.

 No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone.  While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type for basis options.

  Todd Esay called and still wants to book out some power deals. I refered him to Ed Sacks. BUT, I want to hold off on the book outs and tell him we'll do them if they agree to a credit ring (will bring in cash) on the gas side. Bill would need to call Sempra credit to verify our total exposure. Can we talk to them about this???? Please let Bill know.   geof 
 Please call Sempra credit and explain the credit ring out.

 Any idea how power looks? 
 The confirms look good. Send them with Exhibit A and have them return signed copies that include Exhibit B, which will be a copy of the confirm b/w BMO and Reliant.  Call me if you ha
