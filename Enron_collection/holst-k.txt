 Peter,  Credit just blessed these transactions.  Give me a call in the morning and we can confirm them.  Thanks. Keith 
 James,  I haved deleted those files.  Sorry for any inconvience this may have caused.  I think I inadvertantly created two new sub folders which I was unathorized to delete.  Keith 
 Thanks for the e-mail.  I'm excited to come visit in Nov.  However, this "bring your wallet" idea doesn't fit well with my new "I'm a cheap-skate mode". Oh well, what's a few bucks...money well spent to hang with a good buddy London.  Nov 2, or Nov 5 work fine, its upto you.  Well I've got to cut this short, Calpine is out banging on some N-M.  Cheers KH 
 Neither Mike nor I have interviewed Scott before.  Our connection to Scott came through a very strong recommendation from our West-Power trading desk in Portland.  We are interested in Scott because his west power experience is directly related to the west gas market that Mike and I trade.  I don't mean to be a pain.  If this is unconventional, Mike and I will make seperate arrangements for Scott to meet with us.  Thanks Keith 
 Karen,  Mike Grigsby and I would really appreciate being two of the interviewers of Scott on the 29th if that's not to difficult to arrange.  Thanks 
 Jeff,  Lets make dinner plans to discuss this.....Just kidding.  While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he'll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.  Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.  This should not be an issue.  Keith 
 Mike,  Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.  PRODUCTION  This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling.  Existing production  Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.  New production  Fro
