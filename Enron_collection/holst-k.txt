 Peter,  Credit just blessed these transactions.  Give me a call in the morning and we can confirm them.  Thanks. Keith 
 James,  I haved deleted those files.  Sorry for any inconvience this may have caused.  I think I inadvertantly created two new sub folders which I was unathorized to delete.  Keith 
 Thanks for the e-mail.  I'm excited to come visit in Nov.  However, this "bring your wallet" idea doesn't fit well with my new "I'm a cheap-skate mode". Oh well, what's a few bucks...money well spent to hang with a good buddy London.  Nov 2, or Nov 5 work fine, its upto you.  Well I've got to cut this short, Calpine is out banging on some N-M.  Cheers KH 
 Neither Mike nor I have interviewed Scott before.  Our connection to Scott came through a very strong recommendation from our West-Power trading desk in Portland.  We are interested in Scott because his west power experience is directly related to the west gas market that Mike and I trade.  I don't mean to be a pain.  If this is unconventional, Mike and I will make seperate arrangements for Scott to meet with us.  Thanks Keith 
 Karen,  Mike Grigsby and I would really appreciate being two of the interviewers of Scott on the 29th if that's not to difficult to arrange.  Thanks 
 Jeff,  Lets make dinner plans to discuss this.....Just kidding.  While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he'll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.  Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.  This should not be an issue.  Keith 
 Mike,  Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.  PRODUCTION  This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling.  Existing production  Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.  New production  From rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which "zone" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the "easy wells" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.  Unresolved  Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the corresponding plants.  DEMAND  This effort is being led by Mat Smith and supported by Jason Huang and myself.  Our near-term goals are to refine the existing California model and to develop similar models for the PNW, DSW, and RM.  Jason Wolfe is facilitating data collection and interpretation for the PNW.  I will likely recruit Billianna to follow suit in the DSW.  Jason Huang is moving to Gaskill's group, however, he will still have some involvement in this project.  I still intend on recruiting an individual from the research group, but feel that it is best to have the other regions "framed" (ie: model built) prior to bringing that person aboard.  His role will be to refine our technique and mathematics.  Data collection and interpretation  Much of the needed data is already in place, however some work remains.  Our existing NWPL histories consist of a handfull of compressor flows; demand is calculated by subtracting the downstream flow from the upstream flow.  This "rough"  method works, but the downsides are: (1) this calculated number includes changes in line pack and therfore true demand is hidden; (2) we are forced to break NWPL into arbitrary regions determined by the placement of compressors.  Jason W. is working on collecting flows at every meter on the pipe.  This will afford a much more accurate reading of true demand devoid of linepack changes and significantly better regression analysis will result.  Jason is also looking at a more meaningful way of dividing the pipe into demand zones.  El Paso's system does not provide flows at individual meters, but we have recently discovered that several years of actual flows for pre-determined zones are available.  (Phoenix area, Tucson area, and El Paso City area).  Monique was working on uploading this data into our database.  I think Bilianna can pick up where Monique left off.  An ongoing process will be to drill into the various demand zones to gain a better understanding of specific drivers of that demand.  ie: weather sensitive load, industrial load and related economic factors, etc...  PNW, DSW, and RM regression analsysis  Two hurdles have prevented us from moving forward on this front.  First, the data collection discussed above-- this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.  Provided things go according to plan, we should have "rough" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard. 
 Don,  I wanted to bring to your attention the practice of EES traders transacting with ENA through our origination group. (At least in the SoCal basis which is the product I trade.)  This practice hurts both your business and ours as our marketers are adding origination.  EES incurs higher transaction costs and ENA may be losing out on deal flow because of inflated prices.  We addressed this issue several months ago by requesting that EES traders call our trading desk directly.  Assuming it was solved, I had not given it another thought.  Unfortunately, I have learned that this practice has been resurrected.  It is neither my place nor intention to tell you how to run your group, so I am requesting that you put an end to it on your side.  We are committed to providing liquidity at market prices to your desk.  Sincerely, Keith Holst 
 Mike Grigsby and I wish to recommend Scott Freeman for the October 29th trading track interviews.  Scott has accepted an analyst position with Enron and will be starting full-time in January, however, he worked as an intern this past summer with West-Power Trading in Portland and comes highly recommended.  Scott's phone number is 512-294-7692.  Please let me know if you anything else from us.  Thanks, Keith Holst 
 Tim,  We definitely appreciate any time that Steve is able to spare.  If you like, I will ask Mat coordinate his travel plans with Steve.  Also, if Steve made his rework documentation available, Mat would become familiar with it prior to his trip.  Keith 
 Vince,  We are searching for an individual to join the west gas trading desk on a temporary basis to lead t
