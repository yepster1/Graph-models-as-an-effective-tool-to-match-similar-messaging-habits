 Laurie,  This is a holiday week for people here -- as our Thanksgiving Day will be on Thursday, November 22nd.  Consequently, Anne will not be back until Thursday, November 29th.  We are still awaiting word from our Credit people as to your latest comments.  Susan

 Frank,  Pleae review attached Assignment sent by Craig Breslau. 
 Craig,  Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use the ENA form of Assignment.  Reason being -- the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.  Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA. However, before we can finalize -- Credit must approve.  Jay,  Please advise if assignment of PCS deals are OK with Credit.  Susan 
  Bianca,  Please forward a list of the current financial trades on the books between ENA and PCS.  Legal has been asked to prepare an Assignment of all PCS trades, so I must know the Deal Nos. in order to correctly capture all trades.  Thanks.   Regards, Susan S.
