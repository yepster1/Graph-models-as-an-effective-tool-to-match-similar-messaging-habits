 Tim,  I will be available all week. Thank you for the opportunity,  Bill 
 Bert, This is good to know. Thank you for the update. Well done. B 
 Group, We all knew it was coming. NERC Compliance surveys are continuining. Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load. THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST. Templates and POR/POD sheets are available. If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know. Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th.  Thanks, Bill 
 ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230. I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15. I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.  ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. Chris Mallory brokered this deal.  Thanks Bill 
 Check this sick stuff out. 
 Group,  We have returned to CAPS as of today. We will return to running the Enpower to CAPS report as usual. This will give us a chance to work the performance bugs out of FSP and improve our reconciliation methodology at the same time.  Thanks, Bill 
 Symes, One more index. This is the one I would like to participate in...if it works. Bill 
 I am sorry to hear this Julie. I appreciate your effort and do not envy your task of informing the candidates of our change in plans. Let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Bill 
 YO 
 I already do. B 
 Mollie, Could you resend me the original with the attachment? Thanks, Bill 
 This should go to Bill Williams. Not Bill Williams IIII. 
  This was meant for you. 
 This is appropriate--do not make the Enpower till the next day if it will be under St-Whourly.... 
 We will not be needing any headsets in the real-time group...  Thanks for checking.  Bill 
 A truly useful fount of knowledge... 
 Keoni, I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the "solutions" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly.  I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.  Thanks, Bill 
 Murray,  Thank you for your interest in our group. I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening. We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time). As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move.  Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.  Bill 
 Traders are as follows:  Bill Williams III Ryan Slinger Kate Symes  Bert Meyers Leaf Harasin Geir Solberg Mark Guzman Eric Linder Steve Merriss Craig Dean Casey Anderson Darrin Presto Mike Meier  Thanks for making sure this is squared away, Bill 
 Chris, I have some information regarding our payment to MPC that you and I discussed yesterday. Apparently we cut them a check for $19,937.35 (or thereabouts). The check no. is 9600043219. The check was cut on 01/15/02. MPC does not know why they received this payment. Rich Bruegger is my contact at MPC. Please let me know what I can do to help.  Thanks, Bill 
 Diana, Here is the message that Kate sent to Diane, and the original messages from Diane are below that. I think we will have this sorted out going forward. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Bill 
 Is the bet that I will reject the idea? 
 Matt, Check this out, we got this from our managing director this morning...So is the Fremont bridge a target...how bout the I-5? Might want to pass this on to your mom and dad. By the way--your a wuss for skipping the high school playoff game...    This just came to me today.  This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.  It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.  This is all the information that is available.  Enron Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.  While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.  THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.  REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.  SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING THROUGH NOVEMBER 7, 2001.  NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.  RECIPIENTS WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.  RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.  We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.  Thank you. 
 Group,.  I will be out of the office on Friday November 2nd, I will return on Monday November 5th. If you have questions, please call me on my phone at 503-887-3449.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group--  NO TRADES WITH SEMPRA UNTIL FURTHER.  Do not sell to them, do not buy from them. They are in a box.  You may want to let the muni's and other counterparties know. Call me with questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Guys,  When you see Four Corners #5 come back tonight. Please use the fundies webs= ite to send out a message confirming it to Traders and RT. Also, you should= give BPA and CERS a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap powe= r. Also, we are long 50mws flat at PV (see Kate's email)...The prices are $= 27 and $37. Feel free to sell off up to HE 17 at around 39...if you can get= 43 bal peak--go for it!!! We sold 50's across the peak at PV tonight. This= was a result of the Four Corners 5 derate so prices may fall hard tomorrow= . Please try to find some information on the status of SouthPoint and the D= esert Basin unit tonight as well (this used to be Reliant's plant --rumor h= as it this is now SRP's starting tomorrow). As a bonus, CalPine scheduled o= ff of SouthPoint for tomorrow while the plant was still down for maitenence= ...If you get cut--sell them the off peak at PV for $75...MAKE THEM WEAR IT= ! As an added bonus don't forget LADWP and CORAL cut us off for "credit rea= sons"...please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpart= y...   Finally, Services has a new deal with a cement company in NP-15. We will li= quidate the energy for the Services Desk RT at NP-15 +/- $2. We need to mak= e a buy/sell from imbalance under Services at $0 price. We then make a buy/= sell from Services under St-Whourly at NP-15 +/- $2. Finally we buy/sell fr= om/to Counterparty X under the St-Whourly book. Then we need to give Servic= es the swap deal # and the price. The mw values should be on Kysa's sheet. = If this procedure works...please send out an email detailing the procedure = with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical.  Have fun and good luck. Thanks, Bill 
 Chip, Could you help me put Enpower on my local computer? And my monitor keeps sleeping on the job. Thanks, Bill 
 This is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down. Also... Right after the boxes, but parallel to FSP parallel testing. Thanks, Bill 
 Pretty much, its turning into the only day they have available for what we need...short of Thanksgiving weekend or late December...which is getting a bit close to the Holidays...  What do you think? Is it a good way to end the month? 
 Please be sure to send me an email regarding changes, and write them on the schedule. B 
 Cara, Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry. Hopefully it still works for you guys. Did you want to get rooms as well. If so just speak with Jill Chatterton. More to follow.  B 
 Darin, I need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and Kate Symes. Please do NOT send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--El Paso or others. Also, my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com. I appreciate the email, but I had to receive it from our customer. Let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on Sunday or Monday morning. Give me a call on my cell phone on Saturday when you have a chance.  Thanks, Bill 
 Kysa, This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional. In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display Enron's core values: Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team. Please see what you can do to better respect Kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day. 
 Thanks, And sorry again about the stairwell--did you actually get stuck in there? 
 Super. And sorry about getting you locked in the stairwell. I just 
 Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90? My impression is that this was totally trued up... Is this some weird tranny charge? Ideas... As always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month. Thanks, Bill 
 Josie, Sign me up. Thanks, Bill 
 Group, A quick reminder. All El Paso Electric Deals and related deals for El Paso Electric (ie buying from SRP selling to EPE--anything with a group of EPEC in Enpower) need to be in MST. These deals should be scheduled in MST on the deal scheduling portion of Enpower as well.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group- Brace yourselves... Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pu= shed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now prem= ium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme m= orning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 wi= ll have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load for= ecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the g= rid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need = to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be us= ing congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel go= ing in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at= $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get award= ed all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday N= ovember 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue o= n congestion mis-management or poor scheduling.=20  Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.  Thanks,  Bill 
 Ken,  Thank you for your inquiry. I will do my best to answer your questions, but would prefer to answer your questions by phone. I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions. I will usually be most available after 3 each day. You can reach me at 503-464-3730.  Thanks, Bill 
 Geir, I need to get a working cell phone number for you. I tried to reach you at home today regarding the postponement of our meeting. Please give me a call or send me an email with your contact info. Thanks, Bill 
 Matt, I like the Mcleod Resume the best. I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback. Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again. It looks like you have a good start. I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them. Good luck.  Bill 
  Kochel is supposed to get married on March 2nd. Same girl--we'll see if its= the same outcome. B 
 Matt, I will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas... BTW-I heard from Kochel this morning, he is getting married March 2nd in Seattle--did you know his sister was already married to Steve Darue? (poor woman!). The Kelso/Camas game is on Thursday--maybe I will take Friday off...what do you think? Check your hotmail around 3. B 
 Kate, Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day. I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control. She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45. I am not sure where I am at on this index, your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index. Sorry for the short notice.  Bill 
 Just talked with Kochel. He was expecting a bounce in our stock on funds co= vering their shorts. I don't know if I agree after this.  Bill 
 You can go ahead and talk to Fran...Also, how was you vaca? And I have some things for you to take care of from Thursday and this weekend when you have a chance. Thanks,  B 
 Group, As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pacific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation. Thanks,  Bill 
 I still need to interview Stacy but will have feedback when I finish.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group, We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.  For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone.  Do call with questions. Cell: 503-887-3449 Home: 503-274-0502  Thanks, Bill 
 Alan,  I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism. 1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials) 2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as " Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver" Why is there no obligation to deliver? 3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?  Thanks for the help.  Bill 
 Mike, Your cell phone is not working or has been disconnected and I have no way to reach you. Please update me with your contact information as soon as possible. Thanks,  Bill 
 Take these days off too. 
 kate, If you need tomorrow and Friday off, take it. 
 Kate, It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know. I appreciate your understanding.  Bill 
 Definitely...to begin with he should be Michael Mier. Let me know what you need...  Bill 
 When will you be starting your subscription to "Bear Magazine"? 
 Julie, I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington. Do you still want some to go to Seattle and stir up interest?  Bill 
 Cool 
 Group,  The Enron Derivatives II will be on Wednesday and Thursday, November 14th and 15th. The class is open to those who took Derivatives I earlier this year. Please see me or send me an email if you are interested and we will make scheduling arrangements.  Thanks,  Bill 
 We also received congestion for HE 5--50 mws at $74.83. HE 5 is not in the inc sheet but will be. The CISO is again having difficulties reading our bids. They have been working on this for a week. Thanks, Bill 
 Group, The meeting this afternoon will be delayed until next week. I am waiting for more information on UBS. So, next Thursday at 4 PM we will have our meeting with the pizza. Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  Also on Saturday morning...Enpower will be down from 5 AM to 7 AM.  Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.  Bill 
 What are Tracy's thoughts on this? 
 Kathy, I will be available on Tuesday but it would have to be either earlier or later on in the day.  I could meet with Britt at 3PM or at 9 AM. Any idea what this is regarding? Thanks, Bill 
 Kysers,  St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50. We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80. Same deal # as yesterday--#826094. If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it.  Remember, we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60  Sweet. 
 Group, Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system. I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service.  Thanks, Bill 
  Group,  Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.  Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.  Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...  Any questions, just let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
  Tim,  Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager= to work with both FSP and Enpower. David Poston showed the position manage= r to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter. Dave suggested that the new posi= tion manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAP= S and Enpower. When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told th= at the East desk had driven most of the development work to date. The funct= ionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed u= seful, with little development needed for us to implement it. The position = manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's cu= rrent position and report reconciliation methods. My impression of the appl= ication was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not = a stand alone application. Within a week after demostrating the new positio= n manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would= be delayed until after FSP was in production. As a result of the FSP delay= , I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it = since that first meeting. I think this application (as I saw it last) has t= he potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them.= This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal cont= rol. Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the r= eal-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP = and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Thanks, Bill 
 Kysers and Mary-  ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday. The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50. The deal number is 826094. This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday.  Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60. You would have the deal numbers on this one.  Sweet. 
 Keoni, I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.  Please give me a call when you have a chance.  Thanks, Bill 
 Thank you Les. Bill 
 Group,  David Porter will be moving to the Utility Risk Management group with Enron Energy Services beginning Tuesday October 23. Please join me in thanking David for his effort in the real-time group over the past year (especially the 24-hour long shift), and wishing him good luck in his new position.  Stay tuned for a "going away" party for Dave in the near future.  Bill 
 Kate, We are short 3 pieces tomorrow at $27.20, $28.00, and a piece at the ST-CALI index.  We are also long HE2 through HE5 at PV, 20 mws parked with PNM at $16. Deal #'s are-823620, 823657--we will be out in position manager for these hours...BW 
 Group,  Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C.  PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.  We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.  Thanks, Bill 
 Paul, Here is an updated version of the agreement I sent to Steve on Friday. Sorry I didn't cc you to start with. It's pretty much exactly as we discussed. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Bill 
 Group,  We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter= months.  First: With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu= lly manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance o= f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u= nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l= ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold = energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual= (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel= y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav= e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark= eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for= ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat= ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr= oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as = efficiently as possible.  Second: The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very= difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should = look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea= ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 = through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B= e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in= with ECC.  Finally: We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(= the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a= nd the final two months of the year.  Please see me with any questions regarding the system.  Thank you.  Bill 
 Kate, We are short 2 pieces of BOM at SP-15 7-22. Price of $27.20 and $28.00. We are also short 1 daily piece in SP-15 at the ST-CALI index price.  Thanks, Bill 
 My apologies for the public humiliation.  Bill 
 What is this ZP-15? 
 Steve,  Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email. Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it. I understand we may not implement it for a while. However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down. I appreciate your time and feedback.  Thank you,  Bill 
 Group- WWP is good to buy and sell with us again. Have fun.  Bill 
 Yo!!! It's cold, its wet, its raining. But at least in Portland we have F-15 fighter jets being scrambled over the city. Gotta love it. what's the word. Drop me a line on the cellular--(503) 887-3449. B 
 Sean, Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west. Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback. Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us?  Let me know,  Bill 
 John,  Goodness! Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse. First, I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department. I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work), and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift. One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move. Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week. So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there.  I have answered a few of your questions in your email below. We can go over the others when we speak next. Thanks for the good questions.  Bill 
  Keoni,  Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.  I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.  I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.  I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.  I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.  I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.  I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.  I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.  I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule. Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.  At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers. I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.  While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.  I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him.   I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.  Thank you for your help.  Bill 
 Thank you for the email.  Bill 
 Sandra, Please update your email list to read Bill Williams and not Bill Williams III. Thank you, BW 
 Steph, Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway. Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door. And my liver will likely always be in shape.  Take care.  B 
  The CBR 945 RR is a bit sweeter, cheaper, better looking and has Honda reliability... Oooohhh. Nice.  Bill 
   Actually, I think the Honda is probably the one.  Much cooler...and good Honda reliability.  Looks good in Silver or Red.  Bill 
 No problem.
