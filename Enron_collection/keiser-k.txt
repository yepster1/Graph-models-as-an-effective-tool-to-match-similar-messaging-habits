 The following will be the deal entry procedures for UBSWEnergy:  Financial 1.  All non-electronic financial deals to be entered directly by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office  Physical 1.  All current month physical deals to be booked directly into Sitara by front office (logistics/trading) 2.  All non-electronic prompt month forward deals to be booked directly into TDS by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office - physical meters to be added by logistics/trading 
 We would like to change the Netco directory name to UBS.  We will have to change the links to the NGP&L and anything else that links to files in Netco.  Let me know this morning if that will be a major problem for anyone.  Thanks 
 We all need to sit down again. 
 Ashely,  I noticed that there isn't a wacog being used in your P&L.  Currently it is taking the UA4 volume and multiplying it by $0, it needs to have a dollar value in cell M83 on the physical tab.  Thanks 
 Ok, once that is done, we need to set up the RMS access query to extract the new VaR and dump it in the positions by trader spreadsheet.  KK 
 Do you know if all of our books are set up and ready to go in risktrac, ready to report VaR?  KK 
 Thank you. 
 Scott,  I really think that Melissa would be able to handle Storey better than Kristen.  I think we should keep her on Central and let you take Kristen on the East.  Are you ok with that?  KK 
 Brian,  In an effort to keep things consistent at UBS we have tried to perfect a roll spreadsheet that all regions should use.  We added extra rolls so we should never have to add rolls.  We have saved copies for our new P&L's in O:erms\erms_adm\netco\2002\0102\Regions0102 (this will be out new regions file until further notice.  Can you copy one of those files and use that as your new P&L's?  Let me know if you see a problem in doing that.  We are trying to start linking up all new P&L's to the DPR, can you save yours out to that file when you are ready.   Thanks  Kam 
 Luchas,  We didn't run any reports daily for anyone.  There is the DPR that needs to be updated and sent to Showna twice a week that Thomas is doing, Bankruptcy books calculated and post-id's sent to credit daily, and broker quotes need to be saved daily.  Other than that, we were doing mini-books or other requests as they came. 
 I will also be leaving for vacation tomorrow and returning whenever the hell I feel like it.  : ) 
 done 
 In the Bedroom looks better.  KK 
 Kelly will be a power trader.  I don't know if she has any experience doing that. I haven't heard exactly why the weather group left, but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers.  I think that's what happened with them. Good luck with everything, it would be great to work with you again.  KK 
 Congratulations!!!! 
 I don't have any contacts at Duke.  Kelly Little will be working there, but other than that I don't know anyone.  Have you called Scott Neal back yet?  We were just talking about that exact thing, we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do.  That would be a great opportunity for you.  KK 
 You should try looking at Duke,  they seem to be doing some mass hiring of Enron people and giving them big pay raises.  KK 
 We are working on this now.  We have a book with all physical active trades we will be performing on, we are now working on getting the in-the-money financial trades separated into a new book.  Once that book is ready and deals are moved, we will be able to report it to you.  Thanks,  Kam 
 There is a new directory for the curve files.  I am trying to request access to this for the traders so they can't see the rest of our files.  This should be done soon.  Can you move your files to this drive today? 
  Sanjeev,  Could you run the detail for these post-id's in grey.  These are the physical post-id's that were excluded from the original request.  You don't need to run the other post-id's, just the new column I.  Thanks again,  Kam 
 John,  There is another report that needs to be added to our daily duties, it is currently only being done once a month by accounting.  I'll show it to you in the morning.   KK 
 Carl,  Here are the values you requested.  I have the detail if you need it.  Jan-03  Physical		         $71,893 Financial	$123,077,652 Total		$123,149,545    Jan-23  Physical	 	         $71,945 Financial	$121,796,554 Total		$121,868,499   Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
  How do we get into test to view these trades? 
 Could you please re-run the data dump you did for me last week with the attached post-id's?  If you could let me know how long it takes I would appreciate it.  If possible, could it be ready after lunch tomorrow?  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 are Darren and Phillip doing this? 
 Hal,  There will be some changes to be made to this list.  We should know more later this week.  Thanks 
 Kathy,  Vladi asked me to give you a call.  I will be out of the office until about 2:00 today so I wanted to let you know what we did to populate Form A. We gave all post-id's that were calculated on Nov-30th to Zhiyong Wei.  From there, he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets.  It will take a few hours for IT to get the file ready to use so I recommend getting that together ASAP.  Let me know what I can do to help.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 Jeff,  There is a meeting at the Houstonian tomorrow morning.  Is this one for us or did they split the group into seperate meetings?  KK 
  My e-mail will change on Friday to kam.keiser@UBSWEnergy.com 
 Arnold, Kevin Ruscitti, Brad McKay are the only ones so far.  I'm sure there are a few more I don't know about yet.  How is your group looking, who's left, are you in charge now? 
 FYI........  We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.  Thanks,  Kam

 Carl,  Please see attached spreadsheet for the TXU MTM value detail.  the forward value as of Nov-30-2001 is $121,915,684   Kam x3-5781 
  Kristen  correction on the # of people.  It should have been 99.  Sorry,  Kam 
 Yes, unless they find something on my background check....cross my fingers.  How about you? 
 Yes, that is the correct set up for now.  Thanks 
 Kristin,  Here is some information requested from E&Y for gas.  Number of books				182 Number of people				55 Average number of transactions per day	1,674 Number of active transactions		126,878   Other than the rolls supporting the DPR which Scott Palmer is working on, this should be it for us.  Please let me know otherwise.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
  Carl,  The attached spreadsheet will show you the MTM value for all gas deals with TXU Energy Trading Company as of Nov-30. Please see the PBI tab for Price, Basis and Index and the GD Options tab for options.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 I'm about to send this.  This counterparty name was inactivated and we had to manually change the name on about 200+ deals. 
 Thanks for making those changes.  Let us know when we are ready to start setting up the hierarchy.  Thanks  Kam 
 Russ,  I want everyone in risk to have access to all regions.  Traders should only have access to their own.  Thanks  KK 
 Jan 18th  1467398 1467399 1467400 1467401 1467402 1467403 1467404 
 That is fine.  We will use what is already set up, PBregion1.  Thanks  KK

 Denham,  I have attached my resume.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks  Kam Keiser 713-853-5781 
 Do you have a list of new curves for UBS.  They will only be taking over history for the curves we will continue to load.  Kam 
 Shona,  I forwarded Form A to Raj, here is the back-up/reconciliation if you need it. 
  Please call if you have questions.  Kam x3-5781 
 We were able to get close to the DPR values reported with the info you previously sent me.  I won't need anything from you tonight but thanks a lot for being available.  I may need to get with you in the morning to get something else together.  Thanks  Kam 
 Yu could make some money selling your Enron stuff on Ebay.  The keychain I bought for $15 is now selling for over $200.  It's crazy. 
 I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that can you please call Errol McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I don't know how they need to be set up.  Thanks Kam x3-5781 
 I sent this to John Valdes.  He will check the book codes and get back with Cecilia to have her set them up today.  KK 
 Robin,  Darren corrected these.  If you have any questions, please call him....he is the master.  : )  Thanks Kam 
 FYI.....  all org region codes will be in all caps if that makes a difference to you. 
  Yes,  I didn't realize it mattered.  All caps.  Thanks 
 Here is the risktrac book entry template for these books.   This is the same info John Valdes sent you, with a few extra details added. 
  This should help you.  Kam 3-5781 
 The attached file summarizes all MTM value by counterparty, in and out-of-the-money trades, physical and financial.  You can filter column A for P or F and or column IV for positive or negative values.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks  Kam x3-5781 
 FYI....  I changed the west and performance books to your name on the rac website. 
 Do we have to do anything for this??? 
 Kristen,  Once Zhiyong gets me the information, how would you like this handled?  Do you want me to fill out the Schedule A, or would you rather have pivot tables similar to Todd Hall's for each scenario?  Kam x3-5781 
 Bob,  Here are all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night. The summary tab gives you the deal count and MTM value by month, the next tab breaks the value down by counterparty if needed. I already sent this to Kristen.    Here are the performance deals as well, James may have already sent this to you...   Let me know if there is anything I left out.  Thanks  KK 
 This request is saved in O:\_dropbox\Kam\In-the-money trades\Summary.xls.  The file is too large to attach. It reflects all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night.  The summary tab gives you the total deal count and MTM value by month.  The next tab will break out the value by counterparty by month.  Please let me know if this is everything you need.   Thanks KK 
 Ok, thanks for the update.  KK 
 Please see attached.  There is a before and after column for those products that will have index name changes.  Thanks  KK 
 Stephen,  I made a copy of your BenchbyTrader and cleaned it up a little by taking out all the hidden rows and old traders.  It is saved to the same directory as UBS BenchByTrader.xls   Can you look at this and check the macros to make sure it all still works?  Can you use that going forward?  Thanks  KK 
 take me off this list for the last time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 
  Can you please take care of this for the estate curve files?  It will have to be done on your machine, Ashely, for you to be able to load them after today.  Thanks  KK 
  Here you go. 
 Zhiyong  This is an updated sheet of post-id's.  We added many and deleted some also.  Hope this works.  KK 
 Debbie,  Have you had any luck getting the Nov. 30th post id's? I did my best job trying to get them for Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with over 400 post-id's I guarantee that we missed some.  Let me know if you still think it's possible, I would like to get back to Zhiyong today.  Thanks again for your help,  Kam x3-5781 
 Oh yeah, he's the one. 
 Thank you. 
 Kevin,  We have over 400 books that were getting officialized at that time.  I tried to get from everyone which post-id's they used that day from Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with that many books we are bound to get a wrong post-id or miss one.  I need to get the list from credit or RAC to be sure we have the right information.  I have yet to hear from them today. I also told Z to run with what he had and I'll get with him asap if I find it was wrong.  Thanks Kam 
 Mark,  Attached are a few examples of the b
