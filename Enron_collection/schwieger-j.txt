 Jason: As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows: The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February. The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.  The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705  Jim Schwieger 
 For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th= at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a= nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem= ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el= se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati= on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a= s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten= ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v= alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som= ething just the opposite.  I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n= ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha= ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t= he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind= ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa= inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga= me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen= t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua= ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn= ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini= tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an= d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski= ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En= ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?  I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i= n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse= d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se= nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as = their word?  The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t= ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and = took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin= ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp= etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne= ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h= aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders = have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we= re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther = down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve= d and to institute criminal charges.  =20  I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not = think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th= orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor= mance to date.=20

 Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information: 1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future? 2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service? Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions. 
 Are you ready for the visitors this weekend? Hope the weather is great!  Looks like tonight will be really stormy. Flash flood warning is in place.

It's the "pits" I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.

 Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me! I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess. It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly.

Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.

The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years. Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.

  DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31, 2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the filing. Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within the 60 days. Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-393-7402; dan.lowrey@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-11-01 1428GMT(AP-DJ-11-13-01 1428GMT)  Symbols: US;DYN US;ENE  13-Nov-2001  14:28:54 GMT Source DJES   - Dow Jones Energy Service Categories: I/ELC I/GAS I/UES I/XISL N/CNW N/DJWI N/DPG N/LNG N/NRG N/WEI M/NND M/UTI P/NRG R/NAPW R/NERC R/NME R/TX R/US R/USS MST/I/ELC MST/I/GAS MST/I MST/N/LNG MST/R/NME MST/R/US/TX MST/R/US

 Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE. What do you think???????????????????????? Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!  The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me? I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest"

 Chris:  Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from s= omeone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a met= hod that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is tha= t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto= rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent= age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.= We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the= Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would = try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures= for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refill= ing, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining invento= ry.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa= ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected = as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints = This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase= s your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I wou= ld appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is u= sed and how it is put in the model.  =09Jim 
 Greg:  A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity. 2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation? 3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?  Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!  Thanks, Jim 
 If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).  Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content?

 I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

 John:  Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss= ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o= f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution= .  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t= ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str= uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations = of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o= f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr= on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde= d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h= ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa= irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan= so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s= olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny = an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un= der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of = the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

 I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions. 1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses. VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION 3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit. The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit. (For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.) This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.  Thanks,  Jim

 As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts. 
 This assumes 65 bcf or approximately 67 tbtu of pad gas.  According to this mornings Operations Reprt there is 88.3 bcf in the cavern.  This includes Third Party Storage volumes of approximately 3.4 tbtu.  Let me know if this is not what you werer asking.  Jim

 Yes, all withdrawals for Centana should be in the same month (May).  If we don't have a deal ticket for the additional April injections Kenny please prepare one for my signature.  Thanks,  Jim 
 As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter. 
 Ted:  Please respond to Brian's question on when the Ad Val Tax is paid.  Please "cc" me on your answer also.  Thanks,  Jim

 Hi There!  Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.  Im looking forward to Friday night! Don't forget your number for roulette.  Jim
