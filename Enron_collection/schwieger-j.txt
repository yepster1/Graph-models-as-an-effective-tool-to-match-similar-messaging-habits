 Jason: As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows: The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February. The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.  The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705  Jim Schwieger 
 For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th= at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a= nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem= ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el= se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati= on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a= s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten= ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v= alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som= ething just the opposite.  I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n= ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha= ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t= he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind= ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa= inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga= me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen= t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua= ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn= ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini= tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an= d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski= ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En= ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?  I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i= n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse= d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se= nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as = their word?  The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t= ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and = took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin= ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp= etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne= ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h= aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders = have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we= re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther = down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve= d and to institute criminal charges.  =20  I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not = think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th= orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor= mance to date.=20

 Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information: 1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future? 2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service? Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions. 
 Are you ready for the visitors this weekend? Hope the weather is great!  Looks like tonight will be really stormy. Flash flood warning is in place. Sounds like things should clear up and be beautiful by noon on Saturday. Jarrod's birthday is Monday so we are planning on taking 3-4 kids with us to the lake house.  Have a good day. Talk with you this weekend.  Swig

 Linda called and said that they do not have enough vacation days left in 2001, so they would like to use one of the later packages in 2002.

 I'm in a really sour mood. I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time! I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep. It's the "pits" I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself. I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things. My excuse is that I'm always exhausted I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this. I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!  ENE is down $1.42 right now! No news that I know of? The DOW is down (113) right now.

I did make a few changes and saved them as the same document with a "_Schwieger" behind it.  I have no pride of ownership and Im not a writer so do with it as you see fit!  Thanks,   Jim Schwieger 
 Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me! I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess. It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly. I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?  How about you and Mike? I hope all is well!  If there is anything I can do please let me know?  Jim 
 Jeff:  Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.  It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.  Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.  If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.  I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.  Thanks, Jim 
 Vin:  The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know! Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years. Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.  I believe Pat should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001)  I hope this is what you were looking for? Jim Schwieger 
 Jeff: I finally received the replacement pages for the Centana Stg Contract.  The Storage Contract and Firm & Interruptible Transport Contracts should be delivered to you sometime today.  Please review and initial if everything is OK.  Can I just sign after your approval or do I need to obtain someone else's approval?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Jim Schwieger

 The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Oh, never mind that's just Enron stock price! It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here! Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!  Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11. It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away. They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors. I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.  Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend. Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday. The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.  Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you! Swig 
 I think he will be talking with you! 
 I think the industry needs to look at Enron credit rating like a male looks at a women's Bra size. A triple B is actually better than a triple A What do you think? 
 Hi There!  I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration? I went to New Orleans last weekend. It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!

  DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31, 2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the filing. Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within the 60 days. Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-393-7402; dan.lowrey@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-11-01 1428GMT(AP-DJ-11-13-01 1428GMT)  Symbols: US;DYN US;ENE  13-Nov-2001  14:28:54 GMT Source DJES   - Dow Jones Energy Service Categories: I/ELC I/GAS I/UES I/XISL N/CNW N/DJWI N/DPG N/LNG N/NRG N/WEI M/NND M/UTI P/NRG R/NAPW R/NERC R/NME R/TX R/US R/USS MST/I/ELC MST/I/GAS MST/I MST/N/LNG MST/R/NME MST/R/US/TX MST/R/US

 Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE. What do you think???????????????????????? Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!  The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me? I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest" 
 Sorry, I missed your call. I was to busy being sarcastic about ENE!  How about 6:00 PM. I can go for a run beforehand. I picked the time so you have to pick the place.

 Chris:  Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from s= omeone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a met= hod that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is tha= t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto= rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent= age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.= We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the= Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would = try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures= for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refill= ing, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining invento= ry.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa= ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected = as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints = This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase= s your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I wou= ld appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is u= sed and how it is put in the model.  =09Jim 
 Greg:  A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity. 2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation? 3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?  Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!  Thanks, Jim 
 If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).  Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content?
