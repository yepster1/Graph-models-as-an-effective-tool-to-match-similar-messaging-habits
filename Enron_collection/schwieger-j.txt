 Jason: As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows: The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February. The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.  The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705  Jim Schwieger 
 For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th= at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a= nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem= ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el= se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati= on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a= s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten= ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v= alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som= ething just the opposite.  I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n= ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha= ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t= he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind= ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa= inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga= me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen= t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua= ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn= ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini= tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an= d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski= ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En= ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?  I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i= n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse= d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se= nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as = their word?  The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t= ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and = took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin= ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp= etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne= ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h= aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders = have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we= re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther = down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve= d and to institute criminal charges.  =20  I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not = think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th= orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor= mance to date.=20

 Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information: 1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future? 2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service? Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions. 
 Are you ready for the visitors this weekend? Hope the weather is great!  Looks like tonight will be really stormy. Flash flood warning is in place. Sounds like things should clear up and be beautiful by noon on Saturday. Jarrod's birthday is Monday so we are planning on taking 3-4 kids with us to the lake house.  Have a good day. Talk with you this weekend.  Swig
