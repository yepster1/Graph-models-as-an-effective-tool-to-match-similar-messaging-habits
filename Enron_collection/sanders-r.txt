 Please print this article for me. 
 Gail Brownfeld has assumed responsibility for the case. She will contact you. 
 George-- are you ok for the 8yh? 
 I saw your picture in the paper today as ( I think) a "woman of distinction." Congrats. 
 Not only have I seen it, I have also taken credit for it. 
 Can you go to lunch w/ Ileana Blanco and me on Thursday? 
 Andy Edison is handling and he will respond. 
 You have it in hand--as I knew you would. Adkin's atty is supposed to call me at 9:30. you may want to call him today to let him know not to call me. 
 Randy Pais at Enron is handling. You are right that all of this is confidential. I don't think we want anyone to know that we are asking for a permit and the selling the site. By the way, we have no buyer.Randy has your name if he needs anyone in Memphis. Nice to hear from you. 
  I have asked Twanda to set up a short call. 
 no 
 yes 
 Knox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2. What business person, if any, should we talk to about this? With Carrin, Neal M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again. 
 yes--Oct 17,19,24,26th 
  I am willing to allow our name as a cc. Let me know and I will call her back. 
 You pick for me 
 The atty that we talked about in Fla. is Paul Lester, Tel # 305-357-1001. He is expecting your call. Please let me know after you have talked to him. Thx. 
 Do you have Phil Levy's telephone # ? 
     --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 Lets meet for breakfast on friday as soon as it opens. 
 I jest, and don't call me Shirley 
 I never recieved this. Please send to Andy Edison and Lance Shuler 
 FYI 
 William Woods in my directory 
 If you are in yor office, Give me a call. I have lost your telephone # 
 Thx. I'll wait and see 
 Has this been set? 
 I am not sure why you want to go, but of course you can. Just show up. 
 Robert Williams 
 Please send a copy to Bob Williams. He will handle. 
 I will not be able to make it 
 Did you take care of this. 
 Set up a meeting 
 No, we don't care. 
 Bonnie White can help you. 
 I can't see how this could be related to our battles with the AG over trading issues in CA. I have no concerns. 
 This is now yours 
 Did you get this and is it being handled? Also-- what happened to that Nepco case for $2800? 
  I am good for Wed. at Kenneally's at 5:30. 
 Talk to Dave. I think he reports to Shelia so you should talk to her as well. 
  Do you have this one also 
 Is this still on? 
 If I have not already told you, set up a meeting w/ meand Britt for 30 min and then get Steve Elliott to join us 
 Not unless you can cure laziness. I will call him this week. 
 Please set up a call w/ Donn Pickett Tues or Wed 
 I talked to Mark and I don't think we have any interest. 
 Can you call Joel and find out what this is about? 
 Is there any way that we can move this to 3? I have a meeting from 1:30-2:30. Or just move it back 30 min. 
 Greg was going to see how he did and whether we could rehabilitate him. Check w/ Greg before we talk to Mark. 
 At the risk of taking grief for having a premeeting before the premeeting before the meeting, can we talk for 15 minutes sometime today(before 5)

 Re: reporting loop----Andy 
 holly --  linda guinn needs a modem installed on her computer for access to pacer.  please notify the appropriate departments -- this is something she needs as soon as possible.  thanks. 
 Yes 
 I just sent you this case. Please coordinate w/ David 
  This is the Grynberg lookalike we talked about. 
 Andy Edison and I made plane reservations to LA for the Rose Bowl. We are arriving at 4pm on Wed the 2nd. Did you find any empty hotels? 
 Thanks. Have we heard anything more? 
 Yes. I have calendered it. 
  No changes. 
 I need you to handle this. Call me. 
 Thanks. We will run with it. 
 You need to call Jesus Melendrez at x58670 asap. He had a conf. call w/Crescendo and its outside attys today. You need to get in the loop. 
 What about Midland or (worse) Galveston ? 
 You should read 
 Thx. We need to talk asap today. 
 I am not going 
 I have forwarded a copy of this letter to each of you.It involves a wrongful death claim. Gail-- please coordinate. 
 This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.  The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming. 
  The meeting is in 3321. 
 Did this get paid? If not, we need to process asap.    --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 Thanks 
 I need Linda Guinn To have VP authority to approve invoices as outlined below. 
 Two answers:1) I don't think you need one--you can file anywhere in the Southern District, 2) a desire to get crazy judge, like Sam Kent. 
 Per Richard Sanders request, attached is the dial in information for the weekly conference calls scheduled on Thursdays at 2:00 (cst).   Domestic Dial In Number:  1-800-713-8600  International Dial In Number:  1-801-983-4017  Passcode:  56871  Host:  Mark Haedicke  Conference Room:  EB38C2 
 Please note that a conference call re California is scheduled for today at 4:00 p.m. (cst).  The dial in number is 1-800-998-2462.  The passcode is 5264561. 
 FYI 
 Do you have a list of the PX participants committee that you could send me by e-mail. 
 John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts? 
 Please note that a conference call is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 am (cst) re California.  The dial in number is 800-998-2462, passcode 5268429 
 What case is this and why is it still in front of Whaley? 
 I approve 
 You have sent me some random e-mails lately. The reason they are leaving is because Broadband--move closer to your screen while I whisper-- is not making any freaking money. Yes I am going to South America. I don't know when. Why do you care about any of this--- is your ne'r do well brother-in-law one of these people?? 
 Other than the Taub case, I don't know of anything. Linda? 
 By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn(713-853-6104) to get you a copy of the McConville consulting agreement asap. 
 The conflicts are not apparent to me. Please follow up. 
 Give me a call when you get a second. 
 What about lunch today(fri) 
 Howard Weg left me a message last night that you were scheduled at 10am. I suggested to Harry that he call Howard directly, as he is the keeper of the schedule. The interviews are at Greenberg Glusker, which I think is in Century City. The Angels are in town Tues night. How far away is that? 
 Is that going to do it? 
 As you will note, Robin has made some use of the Lockyer statements. 
 Yes, please. 
 Please call Mcgrath TODAY and give him an update and our apologies. 
 I did not get a copy of the case. 
 fyi 
 I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting on Tues re this issue. I will include Mike Day. Is there anyone else that should be in this meeting---EES legal? 
 I have hard copies that I will send to you by interoffice mail. 
 I need to get the attached info to assist with the CA litigation. Who should I call? 
 FYI 
 please print this out so that I can understand it 
 Maybe-- let me switch a meeting or two-- I'll call you back. 
 I don't shop at Tom James. Please take me off ypur e-mail list. 
  This time is good for Enron. We will talk to you then. 
 Please  evaluate Andy Edison. I value your input. 
 I have left a message for Jim. I will be getting back from working a week in the Portland office on Sunday, so we would have to leave on Monday. Are any other weeks after that good? 
 I am flyingt to LA tonight(Mon) and can be reached at 713-410-6128. The las= t I heard, Susman was coming. Whether Steve Susman comes remains to be seen= . 
 What's up? 
 Is that # right? What gives? 
 I am on board. If the PX comes back again, I will call their in-house attys. 
 I am trying to set up a conf. call today at 10:30 central to speak to the Chicago attys. Andy is not involved in this case. 
 Is this guy a problem for us in the litigation? I can talk to the Duke attys re preserving Enron's proprietary info. 
 I haven't heard anything. Could it be that Bill was overstating his position? 
 I will be there. 
 I am scheduled to go to the Lakers game. Sorry. 
 These are all the ones I am aware of. 
 According to his deposition, Kevin is "exploring other opportunities." 
 Fergus and Gibbs. 
 I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you need to make this motion? 
 I am a little behind the curve--nothing new. Has this been resolved? Other than knowing what is happening, what do I need to do? 
 Will do. Hope you feel better. 
 Have we received a settlement offer? I saw Kevin Presto yesterday and he asked me about it. Lets talk today. 
 I have sent you a check. I will take more tickets if someone drops out. 
 Sorry for the late reply. You are correct about  the policy. 
 Has this been set? Who is coming? What is the agenda? 
 Thanks 
 I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week? 
 Did you switch this? 
 Forget Boies and Weiss 
 Anything more on this? 
 FYI 
 Thanks. 
 Delaware is fine. 
 We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner to us both flooded. 
 We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner did not. I called Zisman this morning and was told that his houe was flooded. Yes I need tickets-- 4 tickets for either Fri, Sat or Sun the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th. 
 Can you make sure that this goes to El Paso. I assume that we dont need to do anything else(?) 
 In the short term(one week), we need to lean on him. In the longer term, he is out. 
 Disregard my previous messageabout this case. Thanks for your assistance in= this matter. 
 Set up for Wed 
 Yes-- but lets wait until you and I can talk live. 
 I don't know any of them, although I am familiar with Vinson & Elkins--they are an excellent firm. 
 Please include on our database 
  Please include in my directory. 
 Not yet 
 I manage all the litigation for EWS. 
 None other than the GE case against Power Systems. 
 Have fun. Please tell me it is some place exotic---like Long Beach? 
 Yes, our PR Dept has this service.Thanks. 
 I dont know what this is, so I won't erase it and will leave for you to han= dle. 
 Did you talk to Elizabeth Labanowski(sp?) re the grand Jury being convened to look at Enron's political contribution? 
  This also 
  EES wants to terminate energy contracts(futures cintracts) with two bankrupt entities. Can you let Bob Williams know if you have any comments/suggestions to his letter? 
 I sent this to Hodge and Sager for their comments. 
 I can't open this. 
 I can't open this 
  please RSVP no. I will be in Boston 
 The atty is Charna Sherman at Hahn Looser in Cleveland. By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to take the lead in getting you this information.Linda-- I need to also find the Plaintiff interrogatory response in the CA NSM case to send to Bonnie. I sent the Int. to Dick Lydecker recently. 
 Tracy-- can you look at this and give me a call-35587. I dont understand what it means to us. 
  This is something interesting to put in your back pocket. 
 mtouhey@velaw.com 
 I'm screwed for the forseeable future(some of which is vacation) I'll call you. 
 I am sure I filed it.You can't give up on this. Either we have it or Gary = Grote has it. 
 A belated thanks for sending this. 
 Andy Edison will get back to you on this. 
 I have lost track of this. Is there an actual matter? Who is handling? 
 Please check with John on a later date. By copy of this e-mail, I will ask Stephanie to get alternate dates from you, John,Me, and Jim McCartney and to take the lead on the scheduling. If no other date works, we will go the week of the 16th.   Also- I need you to give dates to Stephanie for the meeting w/me and Mark re your travel schedule.She will take the lead on this one also.   Finally--- I talked to Julia Murray about FCPA training that you were going to do for her group. I think this would be  good PR for you. Please do whatever you can to get them a firm date. 
 I never did this. Sorry. What do I need to do at this late juncture? 
 I need to go to San Diego on the 27th for a 3pm hearing. I can probably go that day. Find out what Robin Gibbs is doing and where he is staying. I need to get the first flight back on the 28th. 
 I was expecting a check from Melanie Gray in the PCA Bankrupty. Call her and get a status report. 
 Just a reminder that I need Seabram"s "I'll say anything e-mail" 
 The problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter. I think we should vote with our overall theme in mind: the PX participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good.  Is that clear as mud? 
 There is no policy that I know of(don't make me write one) 
 Don't do this. Derrick wants me to handle. 
  Can you print this out for me? 
 I am ok. We have gotten into trouble before when we used a different address or fax# that the one contained in the contract. Send it to as many addresses as you have but check the one in the contract. 
 John- I think that Mark Haedicke talked to Sam about this but I wanted to f= ollow up. We want to make sure that Sam is available to Enron as well and t= hat his representation of Idaho Power does not infringe on work we might wa= nt him to do. 
 Linda guinn will get this for you 
 As you attempt to reschedule, just remember the crying faces of ten 5 year olds when Coach Sanders isn't there to lead them on to victory. 
  FYI 
 thanks 
  Andy Edison will get this to you. 
 I tried to call you but could not get through. What is your # ? 
 yes 
 I have been out of the country for the last week, but am in today. I am available anytime this AM. 
 Gareth Bahlmann is doing a big financing and I participated in a California due diligence call last Thurs. w/ the bank's atty, who happens to be Gary Orloff at Bracewell. Gary wanted to see our proof of claim. Can I get a copy? 
 what is your telephone # ? 
 I now see who she is. I am happy to go. 
 Thanks for your e-mail. As it turns out the judge kept the case in San Diego. 
 This looks fine. Can I get a copy of what went. I may be in D.C. next week. 
  Your are on the right and true path. 
 No. Should I? Lrts talk about it Monday. 
 To hire(no) or to represent us(maybe)? 
  We need to talk about this 
  yes 
  I have it as brianp@aiglincoln.com. No".po". Did you leave Susman? Saw your picture on the Texas Lawyer---almost fell out of my chair. Have you parlayed this fame into something else? 
 We have not had any disputes in my 3.5 years and none that I am aware of in the past. 
  When is the hearing and what is the likelihood of it going forward on that date? 
  I am working on the Enron Corp PAC. Can you send me a copy of the invitation so I can submit it. Fax # 713-646-3393. 
 Is this mine? 
 No le hace. 
 Actually, I now can not do it from 11-12. The rest of the day is free. 
 Please call him and set up a time to talk next week- Monday if possible. 
  Are we doing anything on California and do you need my input? 
 Thanks for the update. 
 I have asked my asst. to put a meeting together. 
 I gave this to Michelle Cash. 
 We now have a refund order from FERC which I have not yet  read. The issue = of ENA's liability is, as you would guess, complicated. Are we still on tra= ck for a short meeting to discuss? 
 what does this mean? 
 Jim--- I have talked to Tim. He is ok. Call me if you have any Q's. 
 This is our judge in Sacramento. 
 Should I do anything about this. It is getting ridiculous. 
 The atty was transferred to me from Haedicke's office. I have no idea where they got Mark's # and name.His name is Dave Parkinson 801-323-3208. He is out of Salt Lake City. 
  I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today. We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs. to go over the answer and any other pending items. He promised a draft answer by  3 pm central on Wed afternoon. Hopefully, Paul will be well by then. I will set up a call-in number for the conference.. 
  FYI. This meeting has to do with the Calpers "investigation" of its JEDI investment with Enron. As you know, Willie Brown is the mayor of SF. The city of SF is the lead plaintiff in one of the class actions. 
 Please handle 
 yes-- out of curiosity, how much? 
 Please set up this call. Rick McCombs in at Mayer Brown in Chicago. Also--get his direct no. and address and add them to my directory. Thanks. 
 Your welcome. What was the name of the Dude ranch you described? 
 Yes, please sign it. 
 Thanks for the update and an the encouragement. 
 Can we talk today. Call me at 713-853-5587. If I am not in set a time with my asst. 
 Who is this? Can you send him to Linda? 
 How about 2 my time? 
 This is ok. Lets review them in the SF Enron office. 
 One Mary Jane Smith. As the memo says, these are rumours. 
 Is this call still being held? 
 Probably not If it is for NSM we might have it in McConville's old files. If it is Qualitech then I don't have it. 
 Did this get any press? If so,send me any articles you may have. 
 Whatever happened to this? 
 thanks 
 Only if you say I have to. 
 I am the soccer coach for Daniel and the asst coach for Ben. Our weekends are booked up until early Nov. Can we schedule a workweek for the? Sorry. 
 Sorry I have been less than diligent in getting back to you, although I tried to call today. As David Burns may have told you, I was active at first(when I thought my role as comm. member was limted) I have not been active lately because almost all the lawyers involved in this case seem to only motivated to prolong the case.There is alot of money being spent on nothing. Now I see this Budget. Unbelievable. I am available tomorrow aft. please have your asst. call Twanda Sweet 853-9402 to set it up. Have you talked to anyone else? 
 I assume that you have handled this. If not, let me know what I (we) need to do. 
 I am pathetically and pathologically late in getting back to you.Sorry. Enron is very opposed to this. Can we talk at your convenience today. 
 thanks, we have it covered 
 Boy did I blow this. Have you come and gone? If not, should we invite David Runnels? 
 did you draft a demand letter? 
 Sounds Fine 
 I want playoff tickets but am undecided about next year. 
  Can you guys handle this in my absence 
 I am assuming that this is just an FYI. If so, dont respond back 
 Andy, can you call her re Berry. Thanks 
 If you have not already done so,can you get back to Jim. Thanks 
 Please get to the bottom of this and report back to me. Thanks. 
 Sorry for the overreaction on Fri. I was having a very bad hair day. It see= ms like no harm, no foul. I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on th= is issue. I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surpri= sed that Mirant had voted in favor. Can you call Brian Holman and see where= they stand. If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call th= em and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to b= e on the conf. call thurs. Can you make sure I have the #s.   With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter. Please= let me know if the proposal changes. 
 If possible, don't sign a lease until I get back. If you need a immediate answer, let me know. 
 I left you a voice mail this am. Check it 
 Are you ok? Can you make this call? 
 What is this about? I am here all week. 
  Our attys are at Lebouef, Lamb in New York. I cannot get them by e-mail or phone.. We probably need to postpone. 
 Lets talk at 9:30, if only to reschedule 
 That is probably our lawsuit. Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) is an Enron LLC with Calpers-- the California State pension fund. Lets take a look. 
 I'd like to attend. Please get w/Twanda. 
 Fyi. I told her not to go because we had too many other problems. I do need to develope a plan to deal with FCPA. I would like to mninmize her involvement, but fear this will upset Derrick and Walls. Any suggestions? 
 Can't make it. That is my son's third birthday. Maybe I should bring him and the rest of my family(and inlaws) and try to pass it off as a joint celebration. 
 No, I agree we should file on Monday. I would suggest that we reschedule the conf. call for friday am--7o'clock. 
 We should file on Monday, absent some compelling reason.Let's postpone the conf.call until Friday---same time. I need the draft answer by 2 pm central on Thurs. I cannot have a Thurs afternoon call. Is Rick McCombs available on Fri am? 
 Thanks for the update. Is the hearing still on? 
 Tell Bethany that I am sorry I miss the Country Day Alumni function last Fri. I told her I would be there, but other more pressing matters prevailed----at least I think so--- the days are blurring together. I probably did one of two things--- got drunk( there has been alot of that around here lately), or went home, got in bed, and pulled the covers up over my head. 
 The good news is that the 4th beer usually makes the pain/depression/anger go away. The bad news is that last week it was the 3rd beer. 
  Fyi. It looks like Jim is becoming more informed if not more involved. 
 Have we implemented a policy? 
 thx 
 The Horror, the Horror 
 As you will note from the papers, we are in deep shit. As you would guess, Haedicke is in charge.Call him. 
 The press is bad because it is accurate. I have never seen more greed, arrogance, and lack of morality. 
 If we go to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, we probably can't meet you. Julie is waivering on Las Vegas though. I'll call. 
 I am going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, but am available any day but Monday next week. Let me know your schedule. 
 I talked to Jempy about this last night.He don't want another meeting. We have a new canidate in the hard-ass client category. 
 Good. Lets talk that morning. 
 Two issues: First,should we pay the law firms? Total is 43mm. Second, Lisa and I think that the group needs some direction today. Can we have a 10-15min telephone call at 4:45 or after the Board meeting (6:00) 
 How about we give her some Enron stock options. 
 546 college bellaire tx 77401 
 If you get this, drop what you are doing and give me a call at the office. 
 I can't begin to tell you how much I would like to do that---except for one thing. I will be dead or mortally wounded when I tell my wife. She moved the entire family to a new house on Monday with no help from me.Thanks, but no thanks. I've got some making up to do. 
 yes 
 where are you? 
 no. I am listening now. 
 yes, but if it screws everything up, don't move it. 
 fine 
 Please sign me up for the 19th at 1:30 or 3:00 
 I tried for 10 minutes to sign up before giving up. This has to be easier. It seems to me that someone at HR doesn't get it. 
 Can we talk about this today? 
 Yes 
 Lets talk about all their cases, including the Columbian coal case and the J block case-- Get w/ Twanda and set aside 30 min. 
 Don't know--maybe both 
  Sorry about the conference call this morning--- I neglected to get a call in number. I talked to Paul Simon, who had talked to Limor Nissan, and among the lawyers, we have no more comments. Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues. Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions. If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them. Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading. Thanks for your help. 
 Please handle 
  I have completely lost track of this case. I have asked Twanda to set up a call w/ you, me, and our outside counsel. Now for the 100,000 question----who is our outside counsel? Let Twanda know. 
 Looks good 
 YOU ARE ONE ANAL DUDE 
 Huh? For you to handle as you wish. 
 This is pathetic but I don't know the status of this. What is going on? Did we send the letter? 
 I am coming in Mon. morning. Let me know if there is any change in the schedule. Thanks. 
 I may be too late on this but here goes---- if arbitration is out then agree to a forum that is not in their backyard. 
 The issue of the SCE bankruptcy will come up again. Carl-- did you ever talk to Reliant or Mirant? The next call that you have re the PG&E bankruptcy, I would like  to join in and dicuss the issue of an involuntary filing. I know we have talked about it before, but because of the hijackers, we never got the full legal analysis. Tom Laria at White and Case and the McCutchen attys had done some research. They offered to provide it to us. Lets take a look, do our own research, and discuss. 
 what is this/ who is this 
 This will confirm that I would like to have an organizational meeting at 2 pm central on Tuesday the 18th---one hour. Twanda will provide a call in #. 
  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Twanda to set up a short conf.call w/yo= u on Wed or Thurs to discuss these issues 
 I am not in a huge hurry. I just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time. LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week. I think LLGM is in a better position than Enron to dictate timing, so I'll leave the scheduling to you. 
 Thats like saying you want to be a prisoner/inmate to get the free cable. 
 Sounds like a good plan. Andrea-- I have asked my asst. to get with you to reschedule. M. Haedicke wanted the criminal atty on the call. 
 I tried to call you, but the phones are out. No urgency, I just remember your proximity to the WTC and wanted to make sure you and the members of your firm are OK. 
 Yes. I will do so. 
 I am ok 
 As you will recall, Steve was referred to us by Neal Manne and served as local counsel in the Glatzer matter. He has done a great job. Although I don't have anything now, I would love to send something his way. 
  Please handle 
 I just talked to our accounting dept and told them about your proposal to f= ix the mistake. They are ok with it. Just make sure you document it as desc= ribed in this e-mail.  P.S. There is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill. This  must be t= he kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in Sacramento. 
  FYI 
 Thanks. I'll take the third week of February. By the way-- if you call the house during that week and someone tells you they rented it from me for $5000 per day, that's my brother and no matter what he says, that's only an inside joke in our family. 
 Sounds good 
 Thanks for the check. The entire Sanders family is going next weekend for a "work weekend." It woild be great if you could go, even for a short time. No one is bringing kids, although Ben is old enough to help. Call me if you want details. 713-853-5587. 
 Call me on my cell phone 713-410-6128. I am ready to go. 
 I am traveling with my brother to Picton on Feb 22. Do you have a room w/ 2 beds for the night of the 22nd? 
 I would like to book a room w/ 2 beds for Thurs the 21st. I have inquired on the NZ bed and breakfast website but cannot get to the reservation desk. My Visa # is 4388 5490 0061 6748 exp 11/03. Can you confirm a reservation? 
 All joking aside, we would love to use it. Maybe next summer. By the way, although I have not invited you and Dave to come to Portland on the 3rd, you are welcome. I am not sure it is the best use of your time. I am flying to SF to meet w/ Gary on the day of the 3rd to catch up on FERC issues You may want to come to that. 
 In your firm's name 
 Yes. XL.RC#105656 
 I have done it but not until this morning. You may want to call him. Also-Novack and Williams have not completed reviews. 
 Call Guidry. Bruce is probably relieved he doesn't have to complete another form. I also left you a VM on the propsed McCartney trip. I need you to coordinate through Stephanie so we can get the dates set in stone. 
 I would have David interface with the Costilla D&O insurer. I would call Jim Studdert re Enron coverage. 
 Yes-- deal with Willie directly. As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine. Is that just ENA or does EES also have a claim? 
 Twanda will call you 
 all 3's. She wasn't bad. 
 I am flying in on the morning of the 3rd, arriving at approx. 9:30. I will be leaving for Portland at 5:30. That should give us from 10:30 to 3:30. 
 You have this on my calender for the 27th of September. 
 Jim Derrick sent me your message to him about this lawsuit. Thanks for your intrerest. We have already retained V&E to represent us. 
 Thanks. I am a mean 30 handicap. 
 I would like to talk to your partner. Can you give me the info. 
 I have to move some stuff around on the 8th. Is that set in stone? 
 Looks good. 
 please coordinate with Mark Wawro at Susman re when we will be traveling to this hearing 
 I have a mediation that day. Let me know when you will be in town again.    jscott@susmangodfrey.com 05/25/2000 03:19 PM

 Twenty percent of the golfers always drop out at the last minute and you end up with more threesomes than foursomes. You should reconstitute the teams.

 Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience.. Some in the group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews & Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to talk about this at length.    "Howard J. Weg" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 04/26/2001 09:47 PM

 I noticed from the attached report that the ExxonMobile case is set for tri= al=20 on June 25th. Since I have not heard from Jim Armogida or you about the cas= e,=20 I have assumed that you have it covered and that Corp has determined that t= he=20 potential liability lies at the Corp level. If this assumption is wrong,=20 please let me know asap. 
 Thanks. Frankly, at this point, it is anyone's guess how this will develop. Given your distance to Spokane, Is there a local counsel that you would recommend---one with good ties to Jugde Whaley.    Parker Folse <pfolse@SusmanGodfrey.com> 04/27/2001 04:02 PM

 It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th. I heard from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for one-half day. That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from Cleveland, we should make good use of this time. I think we should schedule an entire day. Let me know your schedule.

 Just a quick note to say thanks for hooking up with my brother Steve. He is a pretty talented guy and I hope he can help you out. 
 Attached is an updated EWS Litigation Status Report. 
 Can you forward me some information regarding the French firm we discussed last week? 
 I asked my asst to set up a meeting w/ you( it has been set up for the 22nd). I am trying to get a better handle on the Neg CTC's--how they are earned/accrue. She should have set it up for your office. I will come to you. 
 Can you give me a quick update that I can send to John Nowlan re Vinmar and the other case( I cannot remember the name of the case) 
 After your arbitration is over, can you give me a quick (and short) update on Pacific Virgo that I can forward to John Nowlan. 
 Two Questions for you Mike:     1) What relationship does Sen. Dunn have W/ Aguirre or Milberg Weiss---has hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?  2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to the materials given to Sen. Dunn. 
 Robin:  I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

 I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry. Obviously, I am heading up the overall CA litigation strategy for Enron. Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead trial counsel in all the CA cases. He is out of Houston. Mike Kirby was hired as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit. I have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely with me and Robin. Is this as clear as mud?    Sandra McCubbin@ENRON 05/15/2001 08:21 PM

 FYI 
 Do you have a list of the PX participants committee that you could send me by e-mail. 
 John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts? 
 Please note that a conference call is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 am (cst) re California.  The dial in number is 800-998-2462, passcode 5268429

 I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you need to make this motion?

 I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?    "Welsh, H. Ronald" <rwelsh@velaw.com> 05/16/2001 06:26 PM

 4 things:  1. You are right ---something is off about this guy. His behavior is irrational. 2. You are right--- you are obsessing about this too much. Relax and go back on vacation. 3. I handle personal matters for people all the time. This one is pretty minor. If it becomes more involved, we can talk about it then. 4. Relax and go back on vacation.  I will talk to you on Tues.

 Can you go to lunch next Tues, Wed, or Thurs? 
 Please put this letter on my letterhead and lets send 
 I don't know what the deal with Doug is. Maybe we are a lot more aggressive than you when it comes to inviting ourselves on his vacation. I  knew he was going to be there. Late last week, Julie and I decided to go to Austin instead of her coming to Houston for the weekend. I called Doug and told him we were coming. My approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance to to so. He didn't say no.  I should have called you earlier. Julie must have told me to call you 5 times on Sat. The truth is I am so freaking tired that I just didn't do it until Sun. We did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time. Love Richard 
 V&E represents us. Thanks    Britt Davis@ENRON 07/19/2000 11:01 AM 
 Unless their is a reason having to do with the case( ie we can somehow recover our attys fees} I see no reason why we should separate the bills.Send me one bill.     SHoward@milbank.com 07/13/2000 07:55 PM

 I talked to Delainey last week and he said he wanted to have a meeting to discuss. This analysis is interesting. 
 Sorry about the delay in getting back to you. I would do a separate heading. I am not sure who needs to approve this other than me. When Whalley was head trader and COO, he approved. I do not know if it should be Lavo or Delainey. If you know, send it to me and I will get it signed. If you are uncertain, my paralegal, Linda Guinn, will find out.

 Yes. I am the contact person at Enron. The LLGM attys should send me copies of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers, counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As for contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them directly for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made through me. I would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because of time constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

 Those things are such a waste of time- trying to condense 8 points of error and 6 weeks of trial in a 20 minute argument. Bill did a very good job. The opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did not go over well. Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. law. Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument. I personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union. The remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas purchase agreement between Union and the utility district. In short, you didn't miss much.

 Dude---- I will be in London in late July. How far is it to Poland? 
 I am familiar with one active case and one threatened litigation involving the companies on the Investment Portfolio list.  Steel Dynamics has been sued for securities fraud involving the NSM transaction.  Cgas has been threatened with litigation by Jerry Jordan, the former CEO.  Jerry Jordan disagrees with Cgas' evaluation of the stock he retained (which is subject to a buyout provision).  We think it is worth +/- 500,000.  He thinks it is worth +/- 1.5 million. 
 I have not recieved this document. 
 The JLM  case has settled for the full amont of the claim--app. $1.7 mm. The KN case has tentatively settled for app. $19.4 mm. The settlement agreements have not been signed.

 I will probably be staying at the Savoy. I will be there from July 18 to the 28th. 
 Lets get together for lunch. 
 What about hiking the Pacific trail from Lake Tahoe to Yosemite in June/ July of 2000. 
 I talked to Mark Palmer last week about some other issues and casually thanked him for talking to you. His response was somewhat disapointing: " I really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our Gov. affairs office, too bad they have no openings." Sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering on rude behavior. Take the transmission wire job, come repackage the deal to Enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from Enron. 
 yes 
 How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several  weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Looks good---please send. 
 yes    SHoward@milbank.com 07/27/2000 05:05 PM 
 I have no legal issues---send out. 
 After further thought, it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation w/ American Coal, we should keep the documents. To further insulate the Coal Group and you from any claim that Enron misused the information,I suggest that you transfer the information to me and I will hold it for safekeeping. 
 Today is bad. Tommorrow I will call you. 
 Did you get my last message? 
 I am not aware of any reason to hold up the suit. ECT is OK 
 FYI 
 Huh? 
 Yes if you can tell me who she is 
 Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill Gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think they are shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made and that I would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's # is 713--225--4500. 
 Please find the attached weekly report.      [Resending this because it didn't go through earlier] 
 Open new matters. Thanks. 
 Is this the usual way Freshfield bills? Out of principle, I would ask for itemize bills. Please give me your thoughts. 
 ECT is willing to pay 25%,but we will not agree to pick up any of EOTT's share. 
 Pay it. 
 Why not alternate between SG and Fulbright. Flip a coin to see who goes first. 
 It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again. The real question is :did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence w/ the future president. Maybe this says alot for Bush. He thinks Pat is as much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to  take him seriously. Wouldn't that be refreshing. You need to get the real scoop before lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana. 
 The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain. I guess Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six months. There is really nothing more to it than that. When we1) all get a little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it alot more. No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save Yvonne.   I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid w/ you. July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training school in Austin. We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado  or Calif. How about Canada or Alaska. 
 I never heard from him. 
 The attachment is wrong 
 It looks fine. 
 The list should be eliminated. Just provide that the parties should mutually agree on an arbitrator, who must be a Delaware corporate atty. 
 This will confirm that HPL wants a jury trial. Sorry I did not get back to you sooner. 
 Yes. The position is still open. If you have a resume, please send it. 
 The revised letter is fine. Do we want to outline the damages we have suffered------ ie developement cost. If so, do it in a general way 
 I think the list is unworkable because it requires us to do due diligence on all the attys on the list--a daunting task. The suggestion of outlining several firms is a good compromise. 
 Lets meet Monday at 9:30 
 The arbitation provision looks good. 
 The KN matter has been settled. 
 fyi 
 FYI     Also-- I talked to John Ale ,the GC of Azurix today. They are looki= ng=20 for attys. I don't know their attitude about recruiters. 
 Are you still coming to London? 
 I sent the materials(along with a recommendation) to Bob Williams, Enron International's Litigation Manager. If you want to follow up w/him, his no. is 713--646--6412. 
 I suppose that depends on your approach--weuns cowpokes aint got much use fer you folks in the big  city with yer smooth talkin ways. Seriously, Bob is hard to offend. 
 I will be in London attending the oral hearing in the CATS appeal. I doubt I can attend. 
 Dinner is better. I have all three kids this week because Julie has finals the week after next. Hows Tues, Wed, or Thurs. We eat kinda early(6:15)    "Sherry Radack" <sherry@radack.com> 07/28/2000 06:03 PM 
 I have attached a report I asked Tim to produce for me in anticipation of possible litigation. 
 This is our judge in the Beeson case. I don't like him as a judge but I would recommend that we gave him $500-1000. 
 I am OK (but reluctantly) with the settlement. 
 This is the judge in the Beeson case. Although I am not that fond of Link, I think it would be prudent to support him finacially. I suggest $500-$1000. Of course he will want more after the primary. 
 There is no litigation reason why this contract cannot be terminated as outlined in your email. 
 I am not sure about the purpose of this letter. The better response in my mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door. If we do send them a letter, and I leave that to you, we need to have already filed the petition. Then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter. 
 Pay it. Have a nice time. 
 The Wauna and Halsey PPA's with Ft. James have been cancelled. Sorry for the delay. 
 Dude--- There has been a change in plans. I am arriving on the same day(this Sunday) but I have to leave the following Sunday( the 25th) Let me Know your plans. 
 How long is this going to last? 
 Of all the weekends---Doug's and our family are both going this weekend. 
 Never mind the previous message. I have no objections. 
 She did not recieve an offer. Hope all is well. 
 Great job----I've got about 45 more for you. 
 I have no changes.

 For your review and comment.

 I am Asst. Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America. As the title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America . I also have responsibility for litigation in Europe. This job carries great responsibilities. Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated more than 100%. Need I say more. In this job I am also, on occasion,when the mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about how she is conducting our litigation. Suggestions are strictly off limits. I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am  breakfast meetings to answer associate questions. There was a meeting at 7 but there was no breakfast served and no questions answered. Sample question: "Richard, why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas" Response: "I'm glad you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office" What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed Bruce,they  met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.    Personally,since I left the firm we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months. Julie has gone back to school to get her Montessori teaching certification to be able to teach at Post Oak School. 
 I will be in Charleston all next week for a trial involving Cline Res. Maybe you,Tim and I can get on a conf. call. How much is at stake? 
 Please get me new cards. 
 I have attached a draft of the letter to Midwest. 
 Attached for your review is a demand letter to Arco for reimbursement to Houston Pipeline (HPL) for damage to equipment owned by HPL at the Lyondell Plant.

 This is the correct address 
 Gosh---I'm blushing. 
 I think you sent this to the wrong person---at least I hope so because I have no idea what it is.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Does this mean you have heard from Rocky? Dont give up hope yet--- there might be a position not under Rick Shapiro(wishfully thinking) 
 Are we running into a problem with the Nov. 3 trial setting? 
 Here is a message from Neal Manne about his availability for the Nov 3 trial date. 
 I do know them. Great folks. The lawyer for the plaintiffs--Patricia whatever is an awful person. If it is not a bench trial i'll tell you more. 
 The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases. She sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another. One day I'm sitting at the house on Tosca when the phone rings. Its her. She must have seen my name on a list of residents. She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on the loose in the area before. Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and with less kids, I was in the yard all the time. I knew the stray dogs. I told her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they had a dog. Needless to say I never heard from her again. 
 FYI I am no longer on the Board 
 Even though I have not seen te bill, I do have a concern that it will prevent us from making our 3rd Q earnings. How bad is it?    Peter Keohane 07/31/2000 10:31 AM 
 Yes. Send his resume. 
 Why are we meeting again? 
 Send Brenda---but don't spend too much time on it. 
 Yes-- I guess things don't move as quickly as you might want. 
 What is the status of this?

 I am getting the file together. Unfortunately, I am in an Arbitration this week. Does Jolen vs ECT ring any bells? I will set it up next week. 
 Have we been paid? 
 I am OK with the settlement. 
 Fine    Linda R Guinn 07/31/2000 01:21 PM 
 I sent it today.Please get w/ Bonnie ---she will handle but you make sure it is passed off to her. Thanks. 
 I dont want to be the only one using a strike, but if others agree lets strike him. 
 Wed is OK. Tues is bad. 
 Please set up a meeting for next week 
 I am in an arbitration all week. Can you get together with the appropriate person(s) at PGE to find out about the hiring of Richard Carroll and report back?

 I've seen it and it still looks good to me 
 Attached is the weekly litigation report. 
 Fine. What are the court costs? 
 I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke yesterday. As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences between the parties. The legal issue is one straight out of first year Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded simply "I agree." But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In other words I think we can make a good argument to get around  the damaging " I agree" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that kind of panel. I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range. Let me know if you need anything further. 
 I am good for $25. 
 Actually if this case goes to arbitration, it will be in Houston. Know any good lawyers?

 Are you still in charge of recruiting for the collection of assest formerly known as Enron International? 
 I sent a follow-up letter  today. 
 Looks good to me. 
 I have no changes 
 I have asked Britt to follow up on this matter. He will attempt to determine who are the targets of these letters. He is also doing some research on whether the atty violated an ethical duty by sending this letter to Rick Causey and others at Enron. 
 I will call him. 
 Our plan is to be in Ft. Worth by Fri the 11th at 5pm. I was hoping to get together w/ Rob and Amy and Scott and Elizabeth on Sat. night. What about Frior even better Sun. night    Namuathome@aol.com 07/30/2000 11:01 PM

 Perfect 
 I just sent you the letter. I'll be here all day. 
 I guess we will know on Tues. 
 We are going around and around with Sitler's attorney about the appointment of arbitrators. The "contract", and I use that term loosely, between Sitler and Cgas calls for the appointment of 3 disinterested arbitrators. Sitler has appointed a friend of his who we do not believe qualifies as disinterested. The only claim Sitler should have is a request that the district court settle the dispute and order Cgas to appoint an arbitrator. I have asked Bruce Oakley at Bracewell to call Sitler's atty and fish for information. I'll let you know what Bruce finds out 
 Send them to me. I dont think you need to review them. 
 Could you get w/ Eileen and let me know 1) which case this is and 2) what is happening 
 no

 I registered for and attended the first day of the 3 day course on electricity that started Tuesday. Unfortunately, I was summoned back to Houston on a work related emergency. I would like to complete the class if it is offered in the spring. Is this possible? 
 This action by the U.S. Supreme Court may be very good news for the Grynberg case. 
 Your revisions look good. For the last paragraph,change this to "...Enron has not asked Enerstar to reimburse Enron's considerable expenses" 
 I'll be happy to schedule him. What do you think? 
 Done 
 Attached is the weekly ECT Litigation report. 
 I want you to know that I really keep an eye on the restricted list in hopes that NSM will not show up. I want to tell all of my family, especially my widowed mother who lives off her pension, to snatch up as many shares and bonds as they can. 
 Do you have lunch plans today? 
 Are you going to be here for Christmas? 
 Really? I'd feel like a mooch. Lets have lunch next week. Any day but Monday or Thurs. 
 Tues.is good. I'll call you. 
 Obviously, Barrett is already working on this. Please coordinate w/ him. 
 We wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $250,000 and asked for $1 million. It might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out. We would certainly take less than $1 million. What do you think? 
 fyi 
 Linda-- Please check with Stuart Kusin at Susman whether we agreed to return this material. Otherwise tell Kevin to archive it. 
 I just got it this afternoon. It is headed your way. 
 I must be getting stupid in my old age,but I can't understand this email at all. I'll find you tomorrow so you can translate. 
 Do you have any more news on Natolie/IBC?  I am ready to get aggressive. Also---We need to meet regarding Calpine and decide how to proceed. 
 Do we really need it translated? Is Britt getting out of these translations, or does he still have to talk to the French attorneys? 
 Linda Guinn has this information and will contact you shortly 
 I have already given Andy my input. If you have comments , please call Andy before 1:00pm today. 
 Please give Andy your comments by 1:00pm today.

 Lets get a petition ready .What is your guestimate on our chances of success. 
 It is probanly too late to respond-- but her goes: 1. We like AAA. I don't know how good ASP is. 2. I' d like a more neutral forum. The question to ask yourself--are we going to get "hometowned" 3. We do't usually provide for "loser pays" on attorneys fees 
 Lunch w/ you---yes. Presentation----not only no but hell no.    Britt Davis@ENRON 08/03/2000 02:25 PM 
 I thought these were taken care of long ago. I think they relate to Neal's work for EES on the chilled water project for Enron Field. Let me know. 
 Did you talk to her today? what do I need to do to follow up? 
 I have attached two drafts of the response to the California Power Exchange's November 11, 1999. The shorter response is the letter I recommend we send. The longer version has a little more substance.  Please give me your input by 5:00 p.m. Thursday.

 Looks good. Why does Jim McCartney think so? 
 When do you want to pay this? 
 No,just send the letter.

 Attached is a revised letter in the above referenced matter. 
 Is this call going to happen? I am available.- 
 Who are the new firms and what do you know about them? 
 I am fine w/ the bill. 
 Does this name sound familiar? 
 Good job on your conversation. Unless Max wants to pay some nominal amount of money to simply get rid of them, I would advise that we do nothing. We could write a letter confirming the substance of your conversation and warn them not to slander Enron,but I think that might be overkill. 
 I forwarded this to Derrick and Haedicke. Why dont you send one out to every other GC. Thx. 
 The interest rate is fine. We do not  agree to "loser pays" attys fees. The arbitrator has discretion under AAA rules to award attys fees, so we usually leave it open. I would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court for some relief outside the arbitration. Please let me know if you have any questions 
 The phone call to Intermesa and Votorantim should emphasize the following points:  1. The transaction was never consumated.  We have consistently stated that we do not consider the transaction a   "done deal" until final documents are executed.  2. We are no longer willing to consider the proposed transaction.  The reason is simple:  the market has moved and they failed to act quickly.  3. All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive.  Because Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final   documents, it accepted the risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be willing to sign a deal.  4. Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal. Their only claim is that we misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they didn't pursue negotiations with a third party. Our response is: we never made any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to  rely on our negotiations as a basis to forego discussions with third parties when Enron never sent them a binding offer. 
 fyi 
 I would like to cancel,as long as my RC is not charged. Unless I hear otherwise, I will asume this is ok. 
 yes, I will attend. 
 Attached is the letter to TVA. 
 Can you get w/ Staci and take care of this request? 
 I am sorry that it took so long to get back to you.  My paralegal, Linda Guinn, is the best person to answer these issues. Her ext is 36104. By the way, we are not revising our policies.    Richard B Sanders 07/07/2000 11:41 AM 
 The requirement that all three arbitrators have 10 years of experience in unrealistic. We will be hard pressed to find one. Most arbitrators are lawyers. With respect to the second change, it is not a change we should make. This changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the arbitrators is our advocate, to a totally nuetral panel. 
 I think we have compiled all the information you requested. Sorry for the delay. Please call Linda Guinn at  ext.36104

 I just wanted to remind everyone involved with the TVA litigation (and potential litigation) to be mindful of the possibility that some of our internal communications in the next several weeks may be the subject of TVA discovery requests in the coming months. Please do not generate any notes or e-mails without talking to me first. When scheduling meetings regarding strategy, please include an attorney so that we can protect the communications through the attorney-client privilege. If you have any questions about this procedure, do not hesitate to call me at ext. 35587 
 I have attached a copy of the draft response to John Pope's December 13th letter to Dick Ingersoll.  Please call me with your comments.  We need to send this letter by Friday. 
 After reviewing the petition, I think this belongs to EES. 
 I'm ok 
 The plans are up in the air. The first weekend that we are all free is the weekend of Feb 26.(if you can't make it that weekend, let me know.) If all three of us come, there is probably 4-6 hours of work. I would propose that we bring Ben,James and Ryan only. I will arrive Fri night and leave Sun morning. Let me know what you think. 
 I can't tell what changes he made. Can you? 
 Both Sheila Tweed and I have concluded that Kristopher Wahlers is not a good fit for our position. Do you have any other prospects? 
 Attached is a new draft of the letter to John Pope with all comments received.  Dick Ingersoll will send this out to TVA tomorrow.  If you have any other additions, please get them to me today. 
 Britt was going to check with all the Enron GC's. I assume he got no response. 
 Your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money. The other thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two transactions as well. 
 Have you received all the information you need? 
 Send it to everyone you believe should get it. Unless I hear otherwise from you, I will assume you are going to send the letter with attachments today 
 I have pushed this meeting until Feb. We need to meet w/:Mcconville(2 hours after Barth),Barth( first meeting in the morning), and Travis.Please set up asap.

 Yes to arbitration. No to waiver of jury trials,unless the counterparty is in the Rio Grande Valley or some other bad venue. 
 I f you haven't already done so, please review the attachments. Don't provide any feedback in writing or e-mails,simply talk to them on an unrecorded line. 
 We need to meet with, in this order, Brian Barth,Travis McCoullough,Kevin McConville and John Hopley. Lisa Mellencamp may also want to attend the meetings with the attorneys from Millbank.

 I have attached a redraft of the Settlement Agreement with Teldata.  Please let me know if you have any changes. 
 Thanks for yor message. On another front, I will be in London next week and I would like to meet with the attorneys who will be pursuing the Pacific Valour claim. Did we ever decide on counsel? 
 I dont care 
 I have asked Bruce Oakley for a status report. I'll let you know when I hear from Bruce. 
 I am in London this week and will be meeting with David Best on Thurs to discuss. Thanks for your inquiry. I'll let you know after the meeting. 
 Actually, my instructions from Nowlan are to pursue our claim against MTM. I am in London this week and I will try to meet with our London counsel to start the process. 
 By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to pull the Tapes before they are deleted. Can you work with Linda and Ed to pinpoint the tapes we need to pull. Linda's direct no. is 713-853-6104. 
 Please send me a copy of the e-mail along with Kevin's response. 
 yes    Andrew Kelemen 08/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 Bruce Oakley has informed me that we will be filing a motion to compel arbitration, which should stay Sitler's ability to take any depositions. Either Bruce or I will let you know if it looks like the depositions will proceed.    Patrick Johnson  01/26/2000 11:27 AM 
 In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the following language:  The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable jurisdiction. 
 Is this case still active? If so,what is the status? 
 Please print out this memo with attachments and place it in the Calpine lawsuit file 
 As you know, several weeks ago we retained an attorney out of Wahington DC to assist us with the EPA permitting issues. The need for counsel was put on hold when we decided to move the plant. Is ther anything more we need to do to follow up on this matter? 
 Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk? He was the attorney from Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month. All of the comments I recieved were very positive. The last I heard, you were talking to him about salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation level. Please let me know what I should do to follow up. 
 Attached is a letter re the above referenced. 
 Actually, when I say "retained " counsel, I mean we identified the best lawyer available and asked him to clear any conflicts. We don't need to do anything else. 
 Actually, I have a memo that will be finalized today. 
 I have attached final drafts of the Bonneville and Enestar response letters. Please review and revise the Bonneville letter and send it out. Let me know if you have any comments to the Enestar letter and I will send. 
 The check made it to us this time. My paralegal,Linda Guinn, is tracking down where it went. I am certain the $ was deposited. 
 Looks good. Please send. 
 Please send the Agency letter to Louise Kitchen and Mark Taylor asking for comments. Also-- change the reference to "earlier this week" to last week. Get the address from Mark before you send.   On the Hopley memo: 1. Add John Enerson to the list of recipients 2. Place the subsection titled "Suits against...." with the same offset 3. In the 5th line of the first paragraph w/o a heading change "that" to "than" 4. The first sentence of the Noram description is off center---specifically"its" 5. Take out the blank in the Noram description 6. Judge Kent not Judge Ken 7.Take out Midwest Gas Storage heading   Make these changes and send 
 I am in London this week. Can you take a look at this and let me know what it is and what we should do. Thanks 
 I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling rivalries going  I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?

 Cos 18 and 51 are the only ones I am familiar with and they cannot be dissolved. I am not familiar with the other cos, but I have asked Linda Guinn to confirm that there are no cases pending against them. 
 I just left you a voice-mail stating that I am available this morningor(even better) Monday morning. 
 Actually, I said I did not think we should pursue it, but that I wanted Harry to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it go. We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about. Any word Harry?    Britt Davis@ENRON 08/10/2000 09:21 AM 
 If you do not hear from Mike ASAP, track him down or leave me a message and I will. You have access to my schedule so you can coordinate with Ogden.(just let me know before you give the final say so)

If a senior counsel is successful, a promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC. 
 The posting of this bond should eliminate the need to pay on the Enron Corp guarranty. Please refer all future correspondence regarding this matter to Bonnie White

 Easter is good for us. 
 Easter weekend is MUCH better for us. Just make it happen. 
 We left at 10:30 and went to Kenneally's Irish Pub to get something to eat( they ran out of food at the gala) I did bid on a piece of art, but I don't know if I won. I doubt it, it was a popular item. 
 Thanks for the update. 
 The use of Enron's name is OK as long as it is limited to that. 
 Attached is the weekly status report regarding ENA Litigation. 
 Attached for your review is a letter to Julio Cesar Rocha regarding Votorantim. 
 The lawsuit against Agency.com was filed this afternoon. 
 Do you know anything about this? 
 Can you have lunch on Monday? 
 I am very busy and very important but I will make an exception for you. 
 Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them totaling over $8.5 million. These cases are, for the most part , suits to collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small. 
 Where else? Treebeards---on Market Square You pick the time. 
 Thanks for your research. I hammered the old coot on the head w/it this morning. 
 Let me know what time and please invite any judge you like. 
 When you get a minute, call those attys who stated (swore) otherwise and find out where they got their information. 
 I will be there at noon 
 When you get a second, call me and let me know what is happening with this investigation. Also---are you going to Wyoming next week. 
 Roland-- I think that Brian is the correct person to sign these discovery requests. Having said that, I do not remember talking about that before you sent the e-mail to Brian. You need to go through me for that kind of decision. My only comment to the Interrogs is that Brian should use his old title in Int. #3 
 Paul-- plese call Lara Leibman at Enron asap. Her # is 713-853-1393 
 Did you ever send this letter? If so, please send me a copy. 
 Attached is a memo regarding the above-referenced.  Please review and provide me with any comments that you may have. 
 646-3393 
 I have not heard  from Barbara about Eitan, but my reaction is that he is not a great fit because of his lack of legal experience. Typically, we don't hire first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) them. I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced. However, I know that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical. 
 Linda-- see if Barrett Reasoner knows of a video conference  in Houston. 
 Could you give me a brief description of what this is? 
 In keeping with Mike Moran's instructions to be frugal, I did not book a video conference at Enron, but I have asked Linda Guinn to find one that we can attend in Houston. 
 The devil is in the details--- what does the power of atty say. Send it to me 713- 646-3393 
 Looks good. Let me know asap whether we get the requested extension.

 When do you think we will here something ( if today) ? 
 If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to the control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron has no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of winning?  By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to comment on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

 I have not had any contact with the nuetral appraiser, so this speculation is from our outside counsel. Jean Frizzell inforns me that the nuetral is conservative and he doesn't believe that he will put any multiples on these investments. The numbers should be low.

 I have not followed this.  Should I ?    Dan Lyons 07/24/2000 09:16 AM 
 I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.    James P Studdert 08/18/2000 10:58 AM

 I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for depositions. Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this. 
 I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a messaging system that won't let me leave a message. That's ok today because I need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of you when I need to. I wonder if Bracewell's Wash. office has the same problem? 
 Joe--  How long can we hold off on this? I have left a message for Dan Watkiss to call me about helping us with an anti-trust analysis. Maybe you should also be on that call. 
 Call Linda Guinn at 713-853-6104. She has all this information.

 The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space. The policy can  also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where a Judge has required the wholesale production of  e-mails. Imagine if we were required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has happened to a number of companies in litigation  the US( who have subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and others. It is unbelievable  what some people will put in an e-mail that they would never dream of putting in a "written"  document. As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have about the policy.

 Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case. There is only one slight problem---we have no idea what case this is. Neal Manne at Susman represented us in a case against Duke that settled early last year. We have no active litigation  or disputes against Duke. My curiosity is pegged out. I asked Bob Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries. 
 FYI. Dow Jones had a story on our lawsuit. 
 I have attached a draft of the demand letter to be sent to Kingdom Energy Company.  As you will note, there are two blanks:  (1) the amount of out of pocket expenses we are claiming; and (2) the signature line.  Please call me to discuss this information. 
 I think we are in favor of the idea depending on what we buy. Frankly, the kids don't need anything there. What the house really needs are pots and pans. What is the suggestion?

 I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money becuase Schwab began charging a $15 per quater account fee. Does anyone have any suggestions about where to put it--other than in Doug Hester's college tuition. The account is up to(down to) $8500.

 The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida law. Have you looked at Fla. law?  With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point.

 Although it is always a moving target when you try to interpret Randy's e-mails, when he says "more realistic" numbers, I think he is talking to you. I thought I heard that 1) Sterling's case was weak and 2) she has hired a more reasonable atty.

 My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.

 I have attached an e-mail from Steve Howard, our atty in the NSM litigation. Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.  Let me know if you are interested. 
 Any thoughts on this question? 
 Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help. 
 I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do.    Dale Rasmussen 01/04/2001 03:11 PM 
 Based on this information, I say don't go. Let me know if anything changes. 
 fyi

 You should go to this. 
 As you will note from the attached e-mail, Bernard Glatzer is now pro se. It is only a matter of time until the case is over.

 Here is what I want to do on this. I need to review and approve all bills. I do not have to the sign off on the required documentation. If it makes Britt more comfortable, fine I'll do it. But I do not need to do so.

 One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million. As you will recall, this representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we were in CA last month.    James Derrick@ENRON 01/10/2001 05:30 PM 
 As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas. Robin Gibbs had always predicted that this was the likely result.

 Richard asked me to send you this letter for Dave Delainey. 
 He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that case. He never told me that he would be filing anything. In fact, he asked me to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were still looking at what to do.    "Elmore, Benjamin" <belmore@velaw.com> 01/16/2001 05:03 PM 
 I am sorry I am so late in getting back to you. It has been a rough week. It looks like SoCal Ed. and PG&E are really going to file for bankruptcy. We have been working around the clock to review all our contracts with them and attempt to minimize the damage. I will call you tomorrow to talk about how to get your team involved.

 On February 14, 2000, Enron North America (Enron) filed a declaratory judgment action against the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Chattanooga Division, requesting that the court determine whether TVA defaulted under its power purchase agreement with Enron by failing to pay undisputed invoices.  On March 6, TVA filed a counterclaim against Enron alleging that Enron wrongfully terminated the power purchase agreement.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon. They did not give us releases. The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will be happy to answer any other questions.

 It should. I am not sure what game they are playing. Maybe it allows them to argue their block forward positions should not be liquidated because PG&E is not in default to the PX.    Tim Belden 02/02/2001 08:54 AM

 Gary---I think you should write the PX a letter asking:1) where this $ went, 2) whether the Core performance bond has been paid and where that $ went,3) whether the State has paid them any $ for the block forward positions, 4) has a claim been made on the CTS performance bond and is it still active given the State's action, 5)How did they calculate the $17mm chargeback they sent us, 6)what other $ has been collected to minimize the chargebacks If anyone has anything else they think we should ask the PX please send Gary and me a note.

 As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the ju
