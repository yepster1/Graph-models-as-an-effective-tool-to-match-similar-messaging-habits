 Paul,  This is the file from Man that we talked about.  Please give me a call when you get this because it has a lot of data that we don't need, but I can't omit information from the file.  Thanks,  Errol mcLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Thanks for sending this - the trades look good.  Thanks,  Errol 
 I am aware we have several pending items outstanding with Crosstimbers.  I am awaiting instructions from Charlie Otto, as he is negotiating/discussing the deals with Crosstimbers.  I just wanted to give you an update and let you know I have not forgottem about them.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Sharon,  Attached is an Excel file containing Mariner Energy's MTM exposure as 12/29/2000.  This is for the NG-Price book.  Susan Scott will send you another file for the Options book.    Please call with any questions,  Errol 
 The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L as we discussed.  I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process (Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.  Thanks for your help & patience,  Errol 
 Cecillia,  When we choose FIMAT as a broker in Exchange Capture, we can not save a deal because the account number section is blank.  Could you please fix this as soon as possible.  Please call me with any questions at X5-8274.  Errol 
 I'm sorry I will not be able to attend.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 This is correct.  Errol

 Tommy,  No problem, I'm not in a rush. I hope you're feeling better.  I have only request.  Could you please come by before 2:30pm, if at all possible.  I have to have my computer uninterrupted after 2:30.  Thanks.  Here are the vitals.  Windows NT Lotus Notes

 Can you let me know when you plan on installing my Palm?  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 Bob,  I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.     Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Trey,  I will book this tonight.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Deal QQ9854 does not become a NX3 swap until after Dec. 21, 2001, if it assigned.  Before then it has to be booked as a swaption expiring on Dec 21, 2001.  Thanks,  Errol 
 This deal has been changed to a NYMEX swap at $8.14.  Thanks,  Errol    Enron North America Corp. 
 Done. 
 Please run the minibook requested below and forward to Ellen.  Thanks,  Errol

 Cheryl,  They were changed when I sent you the e-mail.  Thanks    Enron North America Corp. 
 John,  Could you please have one of your book admin's send Marc Janichen the Brent curve from last night for the dates referenced below.  I took care of the gas curve he was looking for.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 
 Jeff,  Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any idea on when they'll want him to start?  Thanks,  Errol 
 Frank,  I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date. This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Per the message below, all of the remaining holidays in the system will be removed as business days tommorrow morning.  Please let me know if this is a problem for anyone.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin 
 I now have the deal tickets for N60753.4 & .6.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them from the Structuring group.  The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.  I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 The ordeal is finally over!  These deals are to be settled as NYMEX swaps.  Thanks,  Errol    Enron North America Corp. 
 Marc,  Attached is the NG Price curve effective 02/06/2001.    Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin

Deal QN5772.1 was booked on 01/25/2001 - Enron Sells 15000/d Feb. 01 at 7.115.  The booking of QN5772.1 generated positive revenue of $90,300.

 No objections here.t we don't need.  Tell Mark to proceed.Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT   Thanks,  Errol 
 Daniel - send us the Schedule C form as well.  Thanks 
 Dutch,  Do you know if it will cause any problems for the IT group to archive: o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999?  The erms folder is out of disk space.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeff,  I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.  However, he feels that there is a strong possibility that he will finish earlty and be able to start on Feb. 12th.  I will keep you updated.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Daniel,  Can you E-mail Susan and I the location of the schedule E form.  Thank you,  Errol McLaughlin

 Yes 
 thanks 
 John -- any day would be great!  Thanks, Errol 
 John,  Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.  Thanks,  Errol, X5-8274 
 George,  How are you doing.  Well, I hope.  Could you just give me a quick shout and let me know when you think you will be able to start in our group.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

 Per your request, attached is the NG curve through Dec. 2024.    Please call with any questions that you have  Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274. 
 Done. 
 I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.  Errol    Enron Capital Management 
 Bianca,  Could you please fax up to me confirms for the following deals:  QE1352.2 QF4333.2,3 QF6287.1 QF6446.1 N60753.4&6  I'm gathering these for Arthur Andersen auditing purposes, so it would be a great help if I could get this pretty quickly.  The fax # is 646-2496.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Mark,  Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were included in the information picked up Friday.  I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 713-853-0430.  Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.    I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron. 
 Shannon,  Please disregard first e-mail.  The post-id's for the 30th were: 1121922=20 1121923 1121919.  Thanks,  Errol

 Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do you have left?  I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.  What's up with the 'old' crack!  Baby, I'm just aging like fine wine!!! : )  Errol L.

 Sharon,  How do I call you?  Each time I call you back, the phone goes to cover and there is no message, so I can't leave you a message.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Done. 
 Greg,  Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.  Errol McLaughlin 
 The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Jeff,  For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps. The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let them change those deals too.  On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.  We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.  Errol 
 Shannon.  1124399, 1124401, 1124393  Thanks,  Errol 
 Frank,  After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.  Thanks,  Errol McLaughlin 
 Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.  Thanks -- I know it's a pain,  Errol 
 This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.  Thanks,  Errol L. McLaughlin 
 Sharon,  Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.  Thanks,  Errol 
 Hey Johnelle,  It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now? When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage. Call me when you get a minute!!  Errol L. McLaughlin Lead - Financial Trading Risk Mgmt Enron North America Voice: 713-345-8274 Motorola 2Way Pgr: 1-877-241-1059 (8772411059@pagenetmessage.net)
