 I'm meeting with Jerry Patterson today.  He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.  Jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that Ken has made a personal contribution.  Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.  Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution? 
 Good update.  Please put me on the distribution list for future installments. What about the net benefits test?  Will the rate agreement suffice?  call to discuss. 
 I've talked to McConnell, Shankman and Reck and gave them my OK. 
 I think this would be awkward given the large number of Business units

 Why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses.  We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.  We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.

 We are setting up a process to respond directly to these and other comments, questions and concerns.  Our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations. 
 In my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.  Please review and approve John's.  Please check on mine:  they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.  It may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once. 
 We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power.  I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

 What do you know about this guy? 
 I like your revised version.  I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think? 
 I like the first opening paragraph better.  Also, please don't use the term "corporate relations".  I think "community relations" works fine and won't create as much confusion with public relations, corporate communications or other functions.  thanks 
 I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.  Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we'll put it in front of derrick. 
 she might ... might... be a fit in Billy Lemmons group. 
 Thanks for your message.  We met about the fire drill process yesterday and will have something shortly.  One of the issues we are facing is the absence of "floor wardens" -- people who know the procedure and can help it move smoothly if there is a problem.  If you are willing to volunteer, contact mike terraso.  thanks

 Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind. (Enron Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension. 
 Here is the most recent update I have.  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing. The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).  Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.  Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe. 
 Absolutely ... Im sorry I saw this so late... we could have talked today.  Let's talk Mon

 Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):  Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood A "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.  Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.

  Please look into this 
 Redraft (confirm):  Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.  Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

 Please look into this and give Shelley a call back 
 We can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else, but the money to Brown is out the door. I would still like to see the data. 
 Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know.

 I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone. 
 Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.

 Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b= ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to cr= eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag= ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg= relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi= ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter= connections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create= an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open = transmission system. 
 I couldn't open link.  I s this something new for me to sign or have I already complied? 
 Attached is the final letter.  Please note - there was a small change at the top of page 2. 
 I think this is an excellent letter.  I agree with Sue's comments and have included her changes on Page 3.  All changes have been marked in this version. 
 Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business.  Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings outlook,"  said Skilling. 
 My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading. 
  fyi 
 As discussed. 
 I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media. 
 I love you.  Call me. 
 The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:  On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an= d then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why t= hat makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most= efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competit= ive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic reg= ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the = business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relie= d upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distrib= ution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set p= ricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a = great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for = lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c= ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policie= s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  = The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relativ= ely low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of= the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect t= o rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any = more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "re= tailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Com= petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a= nd terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of = service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign= contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the = legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading= in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be = perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents h= ave a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's clai= m of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer= cise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel= is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific = reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxerc= ise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we co= uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a = claim under such circumstances. 
 Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?  If so, please handle; otherwise let me know.

Each mile that electrici= ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20 "No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said= Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e= nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20 Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was = no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont= rols are in effect.=20 "This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no= t having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20 BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when = power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab= out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20 "Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, = a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee= s the state's power network.=20 The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after= Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting= heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li= ghts.=20 Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha= t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th= ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had= in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20 "We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti= al for unintended consequences."=20 Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less= - efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin= g, under capped prices.=20 "We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20 The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9= 2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because= of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20 Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha= ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20 "California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.= =20 'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20 California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t= hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal= regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit= hhold output.=20 "The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"= said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20 Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue= that they took up only with the greatest reluctance.

The department buys electricity fo= r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20 "They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio= n over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."= =20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca= lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll= ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20 Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia= ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark= et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p= rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A= nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap = will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20 "That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell= , editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind= of certainty at all."=20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import= s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark= ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s= tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou= ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr= ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p= lant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Indepen= dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When = there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ= ished during the latest alert.=20 Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i= n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte= rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent= of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif= ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h= ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20 The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $= 98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent = premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred= it risk in selling to the state.=20 O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t= ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20 In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu= t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou= t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20  The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co= m .=20      Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20 Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s= ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20  By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20  SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev= eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af= ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said. The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su= pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif= ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat= e's electricity since January. At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us t= hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going= to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said. The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s= ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m= eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since = May 31. Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte= nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e= mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli= es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th= e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price = is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare= ntly drove away sellers, Hart said. Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h= ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate. Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare = a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi= ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh= en it should take effect. They got no answer. Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar= ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s= uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency. Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i= t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri= ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la= tely. Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators = had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in = part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr= eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea= ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this = summer. "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said= .=20  Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20

 I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc). 
 I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU.  Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today. 
 Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings?

 Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who. 
 You may want to forward this to your customers. 
 Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue. Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!

 Steve will be in a Managing Director PRC that day - not sure if he will be out in time for a 5:30 event.  Maureen 
 I get in too late tonight, but maybe dinner or drinks on Thurs?

 This is Steve Kean's PAB 
 Here is the slide presentation we were talking about this morning. 
 No change.  The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.  We need to discuss the communication of the changes.  My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.  Is that right?  Is it all employees or only US based? 
 I have a question related to your former responsibilities:  As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).  With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.  What do you think? 
 Call at 5:00 today (3:00 your time), if you can. 
 The attachment was scrambled.  Can you send in word format? 
 Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.  Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk. 
 I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I'm not making the case for a different "tilt" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.  Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.  Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send. 
  Looks fine to me, but I would change the second sentence to refer to the "council" meeting twice per year (as opposed to "committee") 
 Looks good to me (I would not invite Glynn to dinner the night before, though). 
  Please forward to Ralph Reed 
  Jerry was one of the people from Mercatus conducting a seminar on financial and physical markets for FERC staff 
 I don't have a role for Tom at this time, but I appreciate the interest. 
  Looks fine to me 
 Ken had suggested that we try to get Schmalensee (sp?) for the October meeting as a substitute for Joskow.  What do you think? 
 My God ... this will be a lot of work.  How much of this can be pushed to the supervisors? 
 per my voicemail 
 I made some modifications, but we may want to make more ... I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer.  The audience should be redefined as the Senators, not just the members of the committee.  Let's discuss. 
 Thanks for your interest.  We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message. 
 JoAnn Hill is on vacation; I'll look into it. 
 Ken -- the process description (i.e. where Brown could play a key role) is discussed in the middle of the update document. 
 Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.  He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.  Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week:  Listing of who is owed how much in California Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions. Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.  The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this. 
 See attached. 
 Attached are the drafts as of Sunday: 
  Let Maggie know. I love you. 
 I think you do need to be there. 
 Revised documents (reflecting less definitive statements on earnings) 
 revised with kll comments (still need to include all employee memo). 
 Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.  Some of her work was presented by her colleague and Enron Advisory Council member -- Pankaj Ghemewat. 
 I'd like a copy of this. 
 I wrote some comments last night.  Maureen will fax this am.  As you will see, I have some deep concerns about the story -- content and the prudence of doing such a story. 
 including all employee memo 
 Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:  The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000). Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year. Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL). Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data. 
 draft of Ken's remarks. 
 test 
 Let's send it out. 
 See below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him. 
 I left a message.  Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys. 
 =09Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its mana= gement in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.  I have re= frained from responding until now.  Below (and in the attached in Word form= at) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can = call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).  Thank you for you= r consideration.  Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp.   It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (= "Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str= ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  = He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and= the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer= ely to entertain.  =09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f= ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy= the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl= y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make= choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i= ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically= , the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity= market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a= ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t= he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange= les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand= ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar= kets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are = doomed to repeat such mistakes.  Steven J. Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Enron Corp.  =20 
 I got fed up with Krugman . . . sent this out this am. 
 OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons, or does he already have it?  I think #90 might be at the heart of the matter.  If we kept the class size= smaller, we could be more selective, pay more for the higher quality talen= t, make more meaningful assignments, and provide for a more active mentorin= g and development program. 
 We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.  Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato 
 I received an auto-reply email from Terry Tang indicating that she is on va= cation and that I should forward this to you.  In the meantime,  I have spo= ken to Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO.  He said that he would be = happy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for p= ublication.  Let me know. 
 This is great. Rick, Jim and Elizabeth, we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization. 
 David, please forward to the appropriate person. 
 Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings. 
  Thanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.  Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with Jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by Ken's obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here. 
 See attached.  Christie -- please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones.  Maureen -- please put on my letterhead. 
 thanks 
 I haven't forgotten.  I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days. 
 I see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.  Alot of my people are outside of Houston.  Are they solicited anyway?  When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my Houston-based and outside Houston numbers. 
 Thanks, Rob.  I was "writing angry" so I wasn't sure how it would come off.= I did have my wife take a look and she assures me I didn't go "overboard"= . 
 At the end of this string is a letter reply to Mr. Krugman's most recent co= lumn.  As indicated below, Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO, would = be happy to put his name to the letter.  That would be our preference.  Let= me know if you need anything more.

 now what? 
 I think you are the right person to get this.  If not, please let me know a= s soon as possible.  See reply to Krugman's August 17 column at the end of = this email string.  Ken Lay, Enron's Chairman and CEO is putting his name t= o the letter and we would prefer that you publish it as such. 
 fyi 
 Thanks for the list.  One clarification:  What do you mean by the sentence starting "How challenged are we really . . ." 
 Well, I guess when you lose 80% of your ad revenue you get a little sensitive. . .   I wouldn't say I berated him; it was more like merciless hassling. 
  See me about this. 
 no message was attached 
  Many quotes from KP -- the Eastern Power Markets Oracle.  On balance a good article.  Thanks for helping out. 
 I believe we have this already.  John B could you send a copy to John S. 
  I think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes. 
 ? 
  Look at the topic below.  Should we send somebody? 
 We are responding.  I'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who's burning out? 
 Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.  Some further questions:    Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?  If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?  My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it? 
 I talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.  I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.  He said he would be interested.  If you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number. 
 Do we have a time for me to meet with Gil yet? 
 Please coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I'd like her to be at meeting. 
 I know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told Bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob's resume along. 
 Please put a confidential backgrounder re Rod Wright for Lay and I.  I'll be joining he and Ken for at least part of the discussion. Don't know/ havent heard anything re LOng Beach 
 Meeting not unitl 9/24 
 Please discuss with Vince.  I don't know how to engage relative importance 
 Jeff's number is 713.621.8620.  He has left for a whitewater rafting trip and won't be back for a couple of weeks I think. 
 Ask IR 
 I think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now.  But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.  We should be positioned for a great period of growth. 
 fyi 
 Honey, would you post this in the chatrooms? 
 I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.  A couple of requests:  Could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting? We are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.  Call when you get a chance. 713.853.1586.  Thanks. 
 this is what I was talking about this morning 
  recurring item for calendar 
  Hold on.  Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it's worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make. 
 I think we should have a version which says that "ken Lay named ... "  I don't know that the Board actually does the electing, I think Ken may just be making sure that they are OK with his decision.  I will confirm. 
 We still do and you should go if you can.  The next one is in London in October.  Joannie will be handling the logistics.  I am asking Maureen to send you the dates. 
 Do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with Gov. Geringer.  Also, I would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in Wyoming. 
 fyi 
 Bill -- fyi.  I don't want you to take any action on this until we have talked (i.e. please don't forward this or talk to the people involved yet).  Let's talk when you have a minute. 
 Please process the following effective July 1:  David Oxley and Mary Joyce base pay increase to 250,000. (Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley's situation with the EWS O of C.). Mark Palmer (PR) to 225,000. (Note:  I previously asked Mary Joyce to review Mark's position and this is the amount we agreed on).  I would also like to review Shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities. 
  I'll do lunch with Sue 
  Letter looks good to me. 
  I've been thinking about this.  Due to limited battery life, calling areas etc, I'm not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go.  I'm thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into. 
 Please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals 
 OK 
 ok 
 I need the following changes to Outlook:  I need my file folders to be "active" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline. I need my "inbox" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don't want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.  I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline. 
 Let's discuss.  I think we should emphasize, at the outset, our proposed solution. 
 Amy Kim is still an open question. I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy? I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount. I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past). 
 I've been thinking about the need to recast the "e-commerce" position as well.  I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks. 
 This is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk:  effective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.  If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals:  Steve Kean Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550)  John Brindle Senior Director, Business Controls (3-3843)  John Presley Business Controls  Please deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect. 
 What do we think it means for the pace of reform?  Is it a mandate? 
 This is still confusing to me.  I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached). 
 fyi 
 See attached 
 Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson? 
  calendar 
 I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense. 
 I don't want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the O of C. 
 I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for.  I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.  Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results. 
 I want to personally thank each of you for your work following last weeks tragic events.  It was deeply gratifying to see so many motivated, calm, and competent people assemble, organize and get the job done.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep competitive intelligence flowing to our business units and management, and make good and timely judgements on issues as they arose.  I hope your friends and family are well.  If any of you have former colleagues, friends or family who were affected by the tragedies you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.  Again, my thanks. 
 Let's just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments.  Thanks 
 I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.  I'm OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.  we may not get much response now.  We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference. 
 Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing 
  fyi 
  As we discussed 
  I have forwarded this to Fitch.  You should compare with your list and consolidate (or have Gary consolidate) onto one. 
 I talked to Ken yesterday and he is fine with this.

 This is fully consistent with what we are communicating throughout the organization 
 We are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc.  Terrie James is working with Ken on speakers.  It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today. 
 Thanks for the inquiry.  We do not have an interest in sponsorship. 
 I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).  In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today." 
 congratulations ... sorry to see you go. 
 please print attachements also 
 I concur 
  I know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.  I agree with John.  There is little point showing this to Ken ... but you personally know him better, so I leave it to you. 
 Please make sure these individuals know that they have been designated. 
 See below and look at attachment.  In a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity. 
 Here is a suggested Lay quote for the special committee release:  "With the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital, which we are also announcing today, we are taking care of the past and securing the future." 
 Thanks, Jeff.  We have already retained a crisis PR firm --Kekst and Co.  They have been working with us for the past few weeks.  Feel free to mention them to Chase. 
 Nice. 
  Fine as written. 
 Shankman told me tonight that the additional piece that makes up the difference between the 3.2 and the 4.4 has not been irreversibly committed to, so we don't have to pay. 
  Thursday is fine.  Please schedule. 
  Thursday is fine.  Let's talk about the proposed expenditures.  We will need to prioritize. 
 Thanks so much.  As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.  I will be in touch when the time comes. 
  It's going to be postponed til Feb.  I think you should attend when we have it. thanks 
 Please see revisions. 
 Jordan Mintz told me that the release needs to be reviewed one more time by securities lawyers.  He will take care of it. 
 here it is 
 David would  you please forward to the right person. 
 Looks good.  In the memo I wouldn't have ken refer to Dean Powers as "Bill"  sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing. 
 This is the final version agreed to by Citi and Chase. 
 I think we should shoot for Tuesday (after the written info is released Mon).  I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.  Here's what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday's written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.  I also think it needs to be a call not a webcast.  What do you think? 
 Would be happy to.  Just let me know where. 
  fyi 
  fyi 
 The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.  Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the pl
