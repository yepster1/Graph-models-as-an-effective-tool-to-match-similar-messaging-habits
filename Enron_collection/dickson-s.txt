 Thank you for your timely response.  I will call you in the morning per your voice mail.    Russell Diamond/ENRON@enronXgate 03/12/01 04:45 PM 
 Per our numerous conversations, please do not release any payments to B & J until I let you know it is o.k. to make payment.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Good job 
 Thanks. 
 Rae,  I am not sure if Jeff Hodge has already volunteered me.  If he has not, I would like to volunteer to be on the drafting committee.  I am not available May 29th through June 1st.  Otherwise, I can make myself available whenever the drafting committee meets.  Thank you,  Stacy Dickson 
 I am working on getting the Bowie contract.  Meanwhile, I spoke to the B & J attorney.  He asked if Enron wanted to continue to buy the gas.  I told him that his client should contact you directly so that you guys could discuss price.  Stacy    James T Javins@EES 04/23/2001 08:15 AM 
 I am fine with the changes. 
 David,  Attached is a draft of the services agreement with Garden State Paper. Please do not forward this to them.  We need to discuss a couple of things after you have read the agreement.  I also need to add a little bit more legal boilerplate.  Please call me so that we may discuss.  Stacy 
 Jim,  I did not get the e-mail that you referred to.  Stacy 
 Please review and give me your comments.  Thanks,  Stacy

 Susan,  I need to see the contract to figure out what is going on.  Do you know which attorney initialed it?  I can get a copy from him.  Stacy    Susan Elledge@ENRON 04/30/2001 03:50 PM 
 Debra,  Do you have  a copy of this contract that I can look at?  Stacy 
 I was very much looking forward to reviewing the protocol but to my disappointment it was not attached! 
 Russell,  Because it covers swaps, a financial lawyer needs to look at it.  Even when the primary exposure is physical.  Stacy    Russell Diamond/ENRON@enronXgate 05/01/2001 07:46 AM 
 Daniel,  I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of the Columbia Energy contracts with MSCGI  to Enron North America Corp.  I will need to find the document.  It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.  It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Stacy    Daniel Garcia <Daniel.Garcia@msdw.com> 03/13/2001 01:54 PM Please respond to Daniel.Garcia 
 Mark,  The traders at enovate in the Chicago office would like to be able to use the ICE system.  I understand that you are the person who should review these agreements.

 Mark,  Per my previous e-mail.  Stacy 
 Chris,  I am sending Kevin a memo today with the new language.  Stacy 
 FYI 
 Hi Monique,  Good catch.  I made the two changes.  Attached is a new red-lined version.  I am couriering over execution copies today.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Stacy 
 Attached please find the amendment to the enovate/Allegheny Energy Master Firm Agreement covering the credit provisions.  Please review and give me your comments.  Stacy 
 Gregg, The changes look fine.  I found one more typo.  Please see the attached document.  Stacy       Gregg Penman@ENRON 05/03/2001 01:28 PM 
 Obviously, this is not final.  But it does have the letterhead. 
 Eric,  Attached is a sample of the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that Enron North America uses for long term, firm deals. 
 The letter looks fine.    Gregg Penman@ENRON 05/07/2001 11:23 AM
