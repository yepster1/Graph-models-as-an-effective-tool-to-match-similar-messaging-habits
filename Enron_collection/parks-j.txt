 what s your number 
 =20 
 CHANGE YOUR FONT, ITS FAGGIE 
 Lets meet at 1pm today to discuss issues for the power plant. Location: Somewhere in the south building, we will figure that out. 
 i think so, maybe tomorrow 
 i should be over today at some point in time. 
 o:\gas structuring\centana_duke\CIPCO Payment Request(escrow) You will also find the other request associated with Centana. 
 I will hopefully have a meeting today with whom ever will be taking over.  Would you like to attend?  If not, I will make myself available for you if you want to meet. Also, I have put all relevant files on in the o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV folder. Not sure you have access, but Ed can get them. Attached is a file that contains some cliff notes.   Good Luck, Joe 
 Hey, look at this. This should be helpful. Let me know if you want to go over this.  Joe 
 Ed, Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. Who would you like for me to hand these over to? Duke/Centana Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. Ponderosa Energy Partners I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend Chris to help manage this, if that works for you. Pace Energy I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. General Land Office. I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes. 
 9369 TOMORROW 
 The answer is yes. Money was received Friday and Doug should be getting approval to send the other out today. 
 Stuart, I have attached a cash flow worksheet that will walk you through the calculations. The file is located 0:\gas structuring\Centana_Duke.  You will also find other related materials associated with the transaction. 
 Sorry, just missed it. 
 Phil, Not sure the money will hit today, but It should definitely hit tomorrow.   The actual amount we will receive will be $2,735,050.05.  Further, I have requested  that 228,250 be wired out on Monday to JPMorgan. 
 Have a good flight back. Thanks for your help. Its been a trip. Happy Easter Joe 
 Have a happy Easter! Lets talk next week. 713-853-9636

 Phil, heads up, i will need another wire for about 224,000. It will come from funds that I should receive today. I will get you specifics a little later. 
 This is what I show what the partnership has done with TXU Thanks Joe 
 FYI- SO 
 GO Doug Money. 
 He is out of the office until about 11:30. My gut is that this is not going to happen until tomorrow or monday. 
 Chip Checking with you to see if we have approval to pay Duke Field Services. Let me know.  Thanks Joe 
 i agree, its just that i sit on floor where a lot of people can see my screen 
  chip has the info, not sure what his opinion is. thought you would know 
 Doug,  money! yes? 
 b, not sure that was appropriate, however you should send it to my home jparks1@houston.rr.com 
 Would you guys please call me in the morning. We need to get some reports before lunch tomorrow.  Thanks Joe 39636 
 I am going to walk over there ( ED recommendation) if  I do not catch you, call me on my cell phone 713-408-7962 thanks joe 
 This is the latest and greatest from centana. Are you ok with this,  will you review? 
 Chip, I just want to follow up my voicemail. If you can get with me by the end of the day or first thing tomorrow, I would appreciate it. I am trying to get the Centana Storage resolved and need your opinion/approval on an issue.  Thanks Joe 
 You need to let me know if you want to sell volumes. I have to find a market.  Nominations are due Thursday afternoon. 
 whats wrong chet 
 Ed,wants me to get this deal closed. I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas. He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both. Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field.
