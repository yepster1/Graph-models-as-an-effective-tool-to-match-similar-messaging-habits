 I verified the numbers with Ron, he did make the addition error.  I also added the line for the Red Hawk lateral as a separate item.  James had already run the economics using $843mm plus a 5% risk adjustment adder for the Capex for a total of $885mm.  I think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error.  kh 
 life is good, work sucks.  Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.  We need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off Enron.  Supposedly, the lead singer from Twisted Sister was in front of the building doing some kind of rap video.  Oh the depths we sunk to..... 
 thanks!!!!!!!!!!!1 
 is 2pm OK? 
 When you get the pages filled in for "supply", "Plants", and "pipeline", let's review to see how we want the summary to look. 
 Hope you're enjoying the parent visit!  Thanks for the VD card, that was cute.  If Jesse Jackson shows up here one more time, we're getting a group together and going downstairs to moon him.

 TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.  The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .  TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if: 1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or; 2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.   Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)   Opportunities for TW: By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.  A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend. 
  Per our conversation today, when you folks get a chance, I need someone to verify the current pressure of the Gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me.  We are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system.  Please let me know if an answer by Friday 2/22 is not possible.  thanks for the help Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development 713-853-5559 
 how many fingers am I holding up??    Glad to hear it went well.  Have a nice long weekend!!!!!!!!!1 
 Dennis-- Can you tell me, of the following POI's, which are active on any TW shipper contracts and who the shipper is, including contract number? Can I get this info by sometime Tuesday 2/19?  thanks, KH  POI 61206 500391 500392 9109 500241 500242 
 I'm checking that out now.  Western Gas, Sid Richardson, and Duke have all looked at it before.

    Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted  02/15/2002 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. 
 I found these numbers in a file, Loc Code 14039, 14225, 24008  I'm not sure what assets they are in reference to.  kh 
 Guys, is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?  I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.  thanks kh 
 the network may be in here shortly to interview me (Claire Shipman?)  Did the parents make it out of town OK? 
 Here's the info for Gaye Lynn Schaffart (woman) she is Northern Border's Director of Business Planning & Analysis in Omaha gaye.lynn.schaffart@nborder.com 402-398-7824 
 we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.  Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.  By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.  Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.  let me know if you have questions.  kh 
 James, can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to Phoenix using Sun Devil?  case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?  Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).  case 2: same as above but load factors as follows:  year 1-2		50% year 3-4		70 year 5-7		85 year 8-20	100%  We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.  thanks kh 
 yes the 750 case, sorry I left that out. 
 good job, thanks 
 I didn't see myself this a.m., maybe on the evening portion at 5:30pm 
 the new cable modem at home is great (I got the first month free).  It's like being at work in terms of internet speed.  Now I can download those Victoria Secret catalogs even faster!!!!!!!!!! 
 I have a meeting with the customer Thursday morning, is it possible to have an answer by this afternoon?? 
 Allan-- we estimate 40-55% of the Enron sponsors have been severed, this would translate to approx. 200 kids.  Of these, we have only needed to re-sponsor 12 children, but we won't know the final tally until Friday afternoon.  I also understand HISD public relations is issuing a PR today inviting all the press to Gordon elementary next week.  The Holiday Party is 12/20.  HISD phone is 713-892-6393.  Below is description of Gordon Elementary given to me by the school.  Let me know if you have questions. kh 713-853-5559   Geneva - this is the overview of Gordon.

 did you have any luck locating that power plant file I gave you? 
 yep, it's as fast as what I have at work. 
 go for it.  Maybe some public exposure will get you some job offers. 
 snap out of it!!!!!!!!!!  (easy for me to say right).  Don't dwell on the past.  Have you been putting your resume on internet job boards?  An outfit called me yesterday wanting my resume.  Contact jessiica@searchconsultants.com <mailto:jessiica@searchconsultants.com> 
 try these AM 610, 950, maybe 740 
 looks good, thanks for the help! 
 yours truly just got interviewed by the Office of the US Trustee to see if I wanted to serve on the Creditors Committee representing the ex- and current employee group.  I find out later if I made the cut. 
 Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.  We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.  Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.  Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:  Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc. Mr. Philip R. Allard, President 502 S. Koenigheim, Suite 3A San Angelo, Texas 76903 ph 915-655-3300 fax 915-655-3315  let me know if you need any further info.  thx Kevin Hyatt x35559 
 I saw this too.  Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party Brady is with).  Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site. 
 Jean, I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.  Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).  So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?  thanks, Kevin x35559

 did you see this? 
 depending on cost for 1 vs. 2 subscriptions, yes 
 selling out other criminals to bring a speedy resolution to this thing is right 
 FERC has scheduled a conference call for Wed 2/27 to discuss this topic.  I am checking with Glen Hass in Omaha to see if we can get tied into the call. 
 hey I got the printer (thank you).  Any luck on the Win95 or Win98 operating system? 
 Hey, do me a favor and only send this stuff to the house email (jhyatt@msn.com).  Hope you and the family are doing OK. Luv k 
 I'll be on it. kh 
 lunch sounds great, any day at this point is OK, just let me know.  I can come by and pick you up or meet you somewhere. kh 
 that was fast!  Received the agreement from you and am awaiting signature from my V.P. (he is out of the office till Wed. 2/27).  In the meantime, I'm having field ops start pulling maintenance files and easement records.  I'll let you know timing when I get it.  If you think of anything else you'd like to review, please let me know.  best regards, talk with you soon. kevin 
 I have a conflict on Friday, what about another day next week? 
 I would say 1 and if necessary, we could share it. kh 
 that will work.  Let's talk Monday morning and confirm that we're still on. kh 
 if it's OK with you, I'll invite Susan Wadle. 
 Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.  Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.  If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.  kh 
 got it 
 only 2,687 mcf, this is per the field guys last week when they did the pressure check. 
 Roger, see note below.  Can you please have someone start pulling the ROW files for this pipe?  Once they're available, I'd like to review them before we open them up to Pioneer.  thanks for the help. 
 thanks Bob!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'll also need copies of your receipts for the Treasurer.  thx. 
 I am still slated to be the panel chairperson for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee at the Electric Power Conference in St. Louis March 19-21, 2002.  As chairperson, my conference registration is free ($525 value), I only have to pay air/hotel/meals.  Is it still OK to attend this conference? 
 I will be there.  thanks, Kevin Hyatt Enron Transportation Services
