 Here is our forecast 
 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time. 
 test successful.  way to go!!! 
 Randy,  Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the scheduling group.  Plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made. (Patti S for example)  Phillip 
 Let's shoot for Tuesday at 11:45.

 Paula,  35 million is fine  Phillip 
 Tim,  mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site.  Can you please make sure he has an active password.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Brenda,  Please use the second check as the October payment.  If you have already tossed it, let me know so I can mail you another.  Phillip 
 I think Fletch has a good CPA.  I am still doing my own. 
 Brenda,  Please use the second check as my October payment.  I have my copy of the original deal.  Do you want me to fax this to you?  Phillip 
 Liane,  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.   I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen 
 Reagan,  Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.  Phillip 
 Nymex expiration is during this time frame.  Please reschedule. 
 Chris,  What is the latest with PG&E?  We have been having good discussions regarding EOL. Call me when you can. X37041  Phillip 
 Greg,  Happy B-day. Email me your phone # and I will call you.  Keith 
 Kathy,  Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at gas daily today.  I will be out of the office on Friday.  thank you  Phillip 
 John,  Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 2005.  They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday and Thursday.  Phillip 
 Jim,  Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.  Phillip 
 George,  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project:  Ownership Structure  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)?  Who owns the land? improvements?  Who holds the various loans?  Is the land collateral?  Investment  What happens to initial investment?  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule?  Investment Return  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed?  Debt  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan?  Improvement  Construction  Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.  Terms of each loan?  Uses of Funds  How will disbursements be made?  By whom?  What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors?  Reports to track expenses vs plan?  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits?  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits?  Design and Construction  When will design be complete?  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting?  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.  Phillip 
 George,  Here sales numbers from Reagan:     As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date.  Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen 
 Jeff,  What is up with Burnet?  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and I will input. 
 Brenda,  I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for October.  I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval.  I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip 
 Lucy,   You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on Labor.   June  July  August  Total Materials  2929  4085  4801  Services  53  581  464  Labor   3187  3428  2770       Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):  1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?  2.  Check 1410  Crumps     Detail description and unit?  3.  Check 1411  Lucy      What is this?  4.  Check 1415  Papes      Detail description and units?  5.  Checks 1416, 1417, and 1425  Why overtime?  6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?  7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?   Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.  Phillip

 Jeff,  I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening. I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?  What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember we have to get Brenda happy.  Phillip 
 9/8  9/7  diff  Socal  36,600  37,200  -600  NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250  San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500   The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and sold 800 Socal. 
 why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO? What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO? 
 Jeff,  You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch?  I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.  Phillip 
 Larry,  Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities.  I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip 
 Ina,  I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30 
 Ina,  Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from H.R. 
 resumes of whom? 
 Richard,  Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas Report.  It shows 410.  But again that might be just what the two utilities receive.

 Mark,  Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek.         The following observations can be made:  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any questions.  Phillip 
 Alan,  You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst.  Call me if you did not receive them.  Phillip 
 Suzanne,  Can you give me more details or email  the plan prior to meeting?  What do I need to provide besides headcount? Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine  Phillip 
 Colleen,  Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution.  On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up?  Phillip 
 Brad,  With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end.  Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.  Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip 
 Bruce,  Can you stop by and set up my reuters.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add these modifications:  1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.  2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6.  3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.  4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip 
 Lucy, I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this done  Phillip 
 you have my approval 
 Lucy,  We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two files.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week. Then email the file back. 
 Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice excel. 
 Mac,  Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.  Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share   That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.  Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude  10  Total  81   Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,  Phillip 
 I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex. What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI? Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.  Thanks,  Phillip 
 I tried the new address but I don't have access.  also, what do I need to enter under domain?

 Colleen,  I am out ot the office on Friday, but Keith Holst will attend.  He has been managing the Transport on the west desk.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.  First, I want to implement the following changes:  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions. 2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily 3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank 4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations.   Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1. When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow highlighted items.  I have questions about these items. Please gather receipts so we can discuss.  Phillip 
 Ina,  How many times do you think Jeff wants to get this message.  Please help  Phillip 
 Ina, I keep getting these security requests that I cannot approve.  Please take care of this.  Phillip 
 What are your skills?  Why do you want to be on a trading desk? 
 Lucy,  I didn't get a fax with the July bank statement on Friday.  Can you refax it to 713 646 2391  Phillip 
 Send to Karen Buckley.  Trading track interview to be conducted in May. 
 Hunter,  Are you watching Alberto?  Do you have Yahoo Messenger or Hear Me turned on?  Phillip 
 can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved curves each night.  Here is an example that pulls socal only. Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice of index,gd, or our curves.

 Lucy,  I will call you this afternoon to discuss the things in your email.  Phillip

 Wade,  I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your income.  Phillip 
 the merlin ct. address is still good.  I don't know why the mailing would be returned. 
 Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Here is the 1st draft of a wish list for systems.

 Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen 
 gary,  thanks for the info.

 Tim, Matt sent you a email with his attempt to organize some of the cems and wscc data.  Tim H. expressed concern over the reliability of the wscc data.  I don't know if we should scrap the wscc or just keep monitoring in case it improves.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip 
 What are my choices for dates? 
 Lucy,  I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade. Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.  Phillip 
 What is GIS info?  Can you do this? 
 is your voice healed or are you going to use a real time messenger?

 Ray,  Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California"?  Phillip 
 Scott,  I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip 
 Lucy,  I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you email me his number I will call him. I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I can guess your answer.  I might stop by this Friday.  Phillip

 Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.  Phillip Allen

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments. We can adjust office hours on another day.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?  Phillip 
 Al,  I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your email all is well with you.   That's great.  We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us. What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.  My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months. He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.  I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch sometime.  Phillip 
 Mary,  If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month. 12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound fair?  We can apply it to the loan.  Phillip

 Lucy, I am going to be in Seguin this Saturday through Monday.  We can talk about a unit for Wade then.  I will call the bank again today to resolve authorization on the account.  Lets keep the office open until noon on Memorial day.  Philllip 
 Lucy,  Did you get set up on the checking account?  Try and email me every day with a note about what happened that day. Just info about new vacancies or tenants and which apartments you and wade worked on each day.  Phillip 
 This note is authorization to make the following changes:  1.  Set up a new book for Frank Ermis-NW Basis  2.  Route these products to NW Basis: NWPL RkyMtn Malin PG&E Citygate  3. Route EPNG Permian to Todd Richardson's book FT-New Texas   Call with questions. X37041  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Jeff,  I would consider owner financing depending on:  Established developer/individual/general credit risk  What are they going to do with the land  Rate/Term/Downpayment 25%  Let me know.  Phillip 
 Dawn,  I received your email with p&l's.  Please continue to send them daily.  Thank you, Phillip 
 No one will be home on 5/11/00 to meet DSL installers.  Need to reschedule to the following week.  Also, my PC at home has Windows 95.  Is this a problem?  Call with questions. X37041.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Laird,  Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.  Are there any other asset management targets in the west? 
 Kay & Neal,  Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby as long as she is being held.  It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready to start building.  We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the kids to Disney for their birthdays.  Good luck on the house.  Keith 
 Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens? 
 2000-1969=31 
 Mary,  I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3.  He agreed that it would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to #2.  Then they can just focus on #19.  I worked on the books this weekend but I need more time to finish.  I will call you in a day or so.  Phillip 
 Here is my DSL form. 
 Thanks for your help. My assistant is Ina Rangel.

 Are we going to inspect tomorrow? 
 mac,  We will be there on the 9th and I will bring the paperwork.  phillip 
 Mac,  I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier service account, but I will have to transfer the money.  Hopefully this will reach you.  Phillip 
 Gary,  Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com 
 Jeff,  Could we set up an inspection for this Friday at 2:00?  Listing for Burnet is in the mail  Phillip 
 tara,  Please grant access to manage financial products to the following:  Janie Tholt Frank Ermis Steve South Tory Kuykendall Matt Lenhart Randy Gay  We are making markets on one day gas daily swaps.  Thank you.  Phillip Allen 
 Mary,  Go ahead and work with Gary to get a new fridge for #8.  I am going to try and come down this Saturday.  Talk to you later.  Phillip 
 Mark,  Thank you for the offer, but I am not doing the ride this year. Good luck.  Phillip 
 Stephane,  Can you create an e-mail list to distribute your reports everyday to the west desk? Or put them on a common drive?  We can do the same with our reports.   List should include:  Phillip Allen Mike Grigsby Keith Holst Frank Ermis Steve South Janie Tholt Tory Kuykendall Matt Lenhart Randy Gay  Thanks.  Phillip

 Mary  I was out of the office on friday.  I will call you about wade later today  Philip 
 it works.  thank you 
 socal position     This is short, but is it good enough? 
 David,  I have been receiving your updates.  Either I forgot my password or do not have one.  Can you check?  Phillip Allen Enron 713-853-7041 
 re: window unit check with gary about what kind he wants to install 
 Will,   Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position and p&l reporting for the west desk. My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that represent all the risk held by the desk and estimate p&l with great accuracy.   Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items above.  Phillip 
 Go ahead and level the floor in #2. 
 Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.  Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.  Phillip 
 Steve,  Please remove Bob Shiring and Liz Rivera from rc #768.  Thank you  Phillip Allen 
 Go ahead and order the ac for #27. Can you email or fax a summary of all rents collected from August through December.  I need this to finish my tax return. I have all the expense data but not rent collection.  Fax number is 713-646-3239.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Anymore details?  Is the offer above or below 675?  What else do you have in a clean 11cap in a good location with room to expand? 
 $100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it take him?  I think $100 should be enough.  Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.  Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February.  Phillip 
 The file is updated and renamed as Gas Basis Mar 00. 
 It is ok to let the deposit rollover on #13 if there is no interruption in rent. 
 Imelda,  Please switch my sitara access from central to west and email me with my password.  thank you,  Phillip 
 Try again.  The attachment was not attached. 
 Frank,  The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.  Phillip 
 Mary,  I transferred $10,000 out of the checking account on Monday 2/28/00.  I will call you Monday or Tuesday to see what is new.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  Let's just close on March 1.  Phillip 
 tara,  I received your email about setting up Paul Lucci and Niccole Cortez with executable id's.  The rights you set up are fine. Thank you for your help.  Phillip 
 mary,  Are you sure you did the attachment right.  There was no file attached to your message.  Please try again.  Phillip 
 Mary,  I got your email.  Go ahead and get a carpet shampooer.  Make sure it comes back clean after each use.  (Wade and the tenants.)  As far as W-2.  I looked up the rules for withholding and social security. I will call you later today to discuss.  Phillip 
 Should I appeal to Skilling. 
 I just spoke to the insurance company.  They are going to cancel and prorate my policy and work with the Kuo's to issue a new policy. 
 Please get with randy to resolve. 
 George,  Can you please call my credit desk at 713-853-1803.  They have not received any financials for ACN Power.  Thanks,  Phillip Allen 
 Kim,  Doublecheck with Julie G. , but I think it ok to pay Jan. demand charges. 
 I think Steven Wolf is the person to talk to about moving Kim Olinger to a different RC code. 
 is this still an issue? 
 Jim,  Updated curves will be sent no later than 11 am on Monday 2/7.  I want Keith to be involved in the process.  He was out today.  Sorry for the slow turnaround.  Phillip 
 Tara,  This note is documentation of my approval of granting executing id's to the west cash traders. Thank you for your help.  Phillip 
 here is the file I showed you. 
 vishal resigned today 
 Julie,  The numbers for January are below:  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000 Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000 Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000 Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000)  Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or unwind costs?  Phillip 
 Will,  I didn't get to review this.  I will give you feedback tomorrow morning  Phillip 
 Tara,  Please make the following changes:  FT-West -change master user from Phillip Allen to Keith Holst  IM-West-Change master user from Bob Shiring to Phillip Allen  Mock both existing profiles.   Please make these changes on 1/17/00 at noon.  Thank you  Phillip

 forecast for socal demand/rec/storage.  Looks like they will need more gas at ehrenberg.(the swing receipt point) than 98 or 99. 
 Griff,  It is bidweek again.  I need to provide view only ID's to the two major publications that post the monthly indeces.

 Mary  Received an email from you on 1/7, but there was no message.  Please try again.  Phillip 
 received the file.  It worked.  Good job. 
 What did mary write?  Stage misses you?  I sent 2 emails.  Maybe mary is stalking gary 
 Naomi,  The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte. Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman. Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months. I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.  Call me with questions.(x37041)  Phillip Allen West Gas Trading 
 Here is our forecast 
 Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.

 Jeff,  Jacques Craig will draw up a release.  What is the status on the quote from Wade?  Phillip 
 Send his resume to Karen Buckley.  I believe there will be a full round of interviews for the trading track in May. 
 Can you guys coordinate to make sure someone listens to this conference call each week.  Tara from the fundamental group was recording these calls when they happened every day.  Phillip 
 Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time. 
 Tim,  mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site.  Can you please make sure he has an active password.  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Reagan,  Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.  Phillip 
 Jim,  Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.  Phillip 
 Have him send his resume to Karen Buckley in HR.  There is a new round of trading track interviews in May. 
 Alan,  You should have received updated numbers from Keith Holst.  Call me if you did not receive them.  Phillip 
 Tim,  Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?  Thank you,  Phillip 
 Gary,  I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?  Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.  Phillip Allen 
 Ray,  Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California"?  Phillip 
 Andrea,  After reviewing Bryan Hull's resume, I think he would be best suited for the trading track program.  Please forward his resume to Karen Buckley.  Phillip 
 Ned,  Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.  Phillip Allen 
 Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting? Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?

 Johnnie,  Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered. However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.  I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.  Please email your cost estimates when complete.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen 
 Ina,  Can you please forward the presentation to Mog.  Phillip 
 Chad,  Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.  Phillip 
 How am I to send them the money for the silent second?  Regular mail, overnight, wire transfer?  I don't see how their bank will make the funds available by Friday unless I wire the money.  If that is what I need to do please send wiring instructions. 
 The topic will the the western natural gas market.  I may have overhead slides.  I will bring handouts.

 The insurance company is:  Central Insurance Agency, Inc 6000 N., Lamar P.O. Box 15427 Austin, TX 78761-5427  Policy #CBI420478  Contact:  Jeanette Peterson  (512)451-6551  The actual policy is signed by Vista Insurance Partners.  Please try and schedule the appraiser for sometime after 1 p.m. so my Dad can walk him around.  I will be out of town on Tuesday.  What else do we need to get done before closing?  Phillip 
 I will email you with the insurance info tomorrow. 
 Here is a simplistic spreadsheet.  I didn't drop in the new generation yet, but even without the new plants it looks like Q3 is no worse than last year. Can you take a look and get back to me with the bullish case?  thanks,  Phillip 
 I will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units.  Let me know the day and time.  Phillip 
 Larry,  It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents. There is one item of which I was unsure.  Was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase?  If yes, shouldn't it be listed as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?  Phillip 
 Lucy,  The spreadsheet looks fine to me.  Phillip 
 Bruce,  Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list.  I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid.  Probably in early to mid June.  Phillip 
 Jeff,  Jacques Craig will draw up a release.  What is the status on the quote from Wade?  Phillip 
 I still use this service 
 Lucy,  Here is the rentroll from last friday.  The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If you have made other commitments I understand.  Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35.  You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041  Phillip 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Jed,  Thanks for the response.  Phillip Allen 
 Reagan,  I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen 
 Jacques,  The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows:  Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding.  Kohutek- $2,150  Cuatro- $37,800   George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount.  The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed.  Phillip 
 John,  Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith.  Phillip 
 Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day?  Also can you provide some references?  Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.  Phillip 
 Do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.  Phillip 
 Ina,  Can you please forward the presentation to Mog.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  The assets and liabilities that we are willing to assume are listed below:  Assets:  Land Preliminary Architecture Design-Kipp Flores Architects Preliminary Engineering-Cuatro Consultants, Ltd. Soils Study-Kohutek Engineering & Testing, Inc. Appraisal-Atrium Real Estate Services   Liabilities:  Note to Phillip Allen Outstanding Invoices to Kipp Flores, Cuatro, and Kohutek   Additional Consideration or Concessions  Forgive interest due Reimburse $3,500 for appraisal and $2,375 for partial payment to engineer  Let me know if you need more detail.  Phillip

 Jacques  I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if you need me.  Phillip 
 Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?  Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip 
 Cary,  Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:  There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40   What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch would be smaller.  I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.  Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 
 Cary,  Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:  There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40   What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.

 Chad,  Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.  Phillip 
 no problem 
 Reagan,  Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a list of questions on the specs:  1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?  2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose?  5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?  I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.  Phillip I 
 Larry,  Jacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.  Just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it.  Phillip 
 Jacques,  Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership.  I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.  Let me know what you think.  Phillip 
 Greg,  Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:  C
