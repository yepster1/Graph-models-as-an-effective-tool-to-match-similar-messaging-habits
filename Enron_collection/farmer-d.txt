 Can you come down to my desk around 1:00?  D 
 Megan,  I changed the demand fee for Jan.  It looks like Trisha has changed the Transport ticket for the $.11.  I agree with the header charges.  D 
 FYI 
 Tim,  Please forward this to the appropriate person.  Scott Berkman with Bruggers Bagels is looking to buy gas delivered to their chain of stores.  He mentioned locations in Minn, Iowa, Detroit, Pitt, Cleveland, Boston, and Albany.  His phone number is 802-660-4020 ext. 264.  I would apprectiate it if someone would contact him regarding this supply.  Thanks.  Daren 
 Aimee,  Please take care of this in POPS.  It looks like we've already hit the 50,000 mark on #572910.  D 
 Diane,  I apologize for getting this to you so late.  I should have no staffing additions next year.  Staff  Manager 1 Sr.  2 Average to High  Training  Both Seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (Effective Communication) and 1 Technical class.  I think that everything else should roll for next year. Let me know what else I need to give you.  D 
 BH,  I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that everything will be covered.  I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if we decide that is needed.  D 
 We did buy 5,000 from Beamont Meth.  The sale on 603107 should have been confirmed at 18,000 and the buy on deal 611178 should have been confirmed at 5,000 for the 9th.  D   Aimee Lannou   03/19/2001 09:44 AM 
 done. 
 What's the length of your boat?  Does it have a cover?  D 
 We should not be paying Tenaska's Lone Star transport for Sep.  That should be paid by Tenaska IV.  We took over the payments with October production.   D 
 HOw much does that cost?  I mayh run it through Tom's RC. 
 possibly friday.  I will take Mon the 18th off also. 
 In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing money to Tenaska IV.  I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future.  Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.  Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim. Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse Tenaska IV.  D 
 I created # 529824 for Nov and Dec.  D

 What was going on in Feb?  D 
 Gary,  The deal with Williams Terminals expired in Oct.  However, about 3,800 flowed for Nov.  Do you need to renegotiate this deal for Nov.  Or, do we roll it under the terminated k?  What do think about Dec?  D 
 I have rolled the Hilcorp deal.  I will get Gary to look into the Williams deal.  D   Aimee Lannou   12/12/2000 08:43 AM 
 Hey, Ken.  Thought you would like this.  It's a little hard to read, but that's the way I received it.  D 
 Hey, Ken.  Wouldn't this be great?  It's a little hard to read, but that's the way I got it.    D 
 Attached is the preliminary agency agreement related to the Cleburne Plant. This is strictly confidential, so please do not pass this info on to others. I will let you know when we have finalized the contract and send you a copy.  D 
 I think Mark got everything in last night.  You may have to have Vol Mgmt send things through.  Look into it and let me know how it looks.  I will probably be out of the office on Monday, returning on Tuesday.  D 
 Never used it. 
 that's fine 
 I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG.  Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on. I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2). Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.  D 
 We're working on it.  We have had alot of issues with the colder weather.  I will let you know as soon as we get Oct in.  I adjusted #514353, so hopefully the demand will come through better.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.  Ask them about their Lone Star transport allocation.  They had to transport the gas on Lone Star to sell to us.  So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match the sale volume.  Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the transport allocation.  D 
 Mike,  You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather meeting.  D 
 That's not Cole and Jake, Baby....  Do you know what our kids look like? 
 Megan,  I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska deal.  This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.  Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be scheduling this deal as a zero nom.  Hopefully, this will allow the demand charge to flow through the system.  Let me know if you don't see this happening.  For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the imbalance pool).  When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I will change the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off of the sale ticket (#384258).  D 
 Buy Apache  #384247 Buy Williams 384237 Sale Tenaska 384258 Trans Capacity Lone Star 452491&452475  Spot sales will be on various tickets throughout each month.  Deals are under the Cleburne Intramamonth Position in Sitara.   D

 MP,  Apply that volume to the Cannon Storage deal.  The meter is already on the ticket for that time period.  D 
 Tim,  Please forward this to the appropriate person.  Bill Bailey with Southwest Garment & Laundry in Irving Texas is looking for an offer for gas supplied to their business under an 18-36 month term.

 10/17 #439156 9/30 #420864 (This deal is under Samedan)  Are there any other days on the invoices?  D 
 We need to have all the links and the spreadsheets updated by the 3rd workday of December (12/5).  D   Aimee Lannou   11/20/2000 11:02 AM 
 Any processing is handled by Devon.  ENA is buying the residue gas at the tailgate of the plant.  D 
 You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?  An onside kick after you've won the game?  What was Barnett  thinking?  I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery. I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar.  Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?  Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 ft christmas tree?  Or was it bigger this year?  We made the journey to Tuscaloosa.  The trip wasn't too bad.  That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.  I ate way too much, but it sure was good.  Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.  D 
 If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible that we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case, we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed on to the plant.  If you have any questions, let me know.  D 
 For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.  We bought gas from Apache and Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.  We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the Cleburne plant was operating.  On days the plant was not operating, we sold that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA). For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into that.  With the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a couple of months, there are some questions on how to handle Sep.  I'll let you know what I determine about Sep.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 This is the course.  The 7th is fine.  I also have Brandy looking into the tuition reimbursement deal.  Apparantly, the person she needs to talk to is out of the office.  D   Stacey Neuweiler   11/21/2000 04:36 PM 
 Gary thinks that we will not have any problems with this.  D 
 Thanks for the info.  I appreciated the call the other day.  It really helps me out to recieve info early like that.  D 
 I extended deal 461059 for the rest of October.  D 
 Done. 
 Briant,  I'm not going to be interested.  I'm looking for a boat that is a little bigger.  Thanks.  D 
 The buy and sale should net out, nothing to be billed to paid to TGLO.  The volumes should be the same on both sides.  Whoever backs up Tom should reallocate in POPS to make this happen.  We had to show a buy/sale in order to schedule the delivery to TGLO on a third party pipe.  D 
 Done.  FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a spot agreement (#484935).  Let me know if you have any questions.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey, AC!  How are things going for you?  Liking your new freedom, wild girl?  I hope your having fun.  I'm sure missing you on Entex.  I'm already feeling the heat from TM.  With the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts, I have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.  But, that's the way it always is over here.  I've been meaning to e-mail you, but I always remember after I leave the office.  Anyway, let me know how it's going.  Later, D 
 Fred,  Please look at the attached file below.  Can you give me the October volumes for these meters?  D 
 I changed the price to 2.85.  With the changes in personnel on the desk, we don't have a lot of info to dispute their price.  It's not cost beneficial to do so anyway.  D 
 JM,  Is the contract on 461059 good for Nov?  D 
 The old swing deals should not be used for October.  Please have Volume Management allocate any volumes on the old deals to the new deals.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 Charlene,  We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?  D 
 Rolled deal 454057 to cover flow at mtr 5192.  d   Aimee Lannou   11/10/2000 02:17 PM 
 Bob,  I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.  D 
 I added these days to #483894.  d   Aimee Lannou   11/13/2000 11:54 AM 
 This has been corrected.  A transport usage ticket should have been used, instead of a desk to desk.  D    Enron Capital Management 
 Why is there a different deal?  And what is the price?  D 
 I think I hate football too.  4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, run, to pass the ball.  Why not Ja'mar??  The guy who carried 3 defenders into the end zone earlier.  Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from your friend Mary.  So things are not all bad.  How did the Corn boys lose?  If I would have known about it on Saturday, I would have called to console you and the family.  Maybe it's time to just turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.  D 
 Why couldn't they figure this out?

 Gary,  Do you have any record of this?  D 
 The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of October.  We had zero in the system after the 6th because the plant was down.  The deal should have been nom'd at zero on these days.  D 
 Patrick,  The attached file contains the base and spot purchases by zone on HPL  for September 2000.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 You can charge it to mine.  D

 Charlene,  Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.  I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.  D 
 Done.  D 
 Jackie,  I didn't pay any attention to the date on this message.  We should be able to handle this on our side with out involving the East Desk.  If the OBA can be used, apply the volume there.  If nothing else, we can write it off.  D 
 Sorry about this, Victor.  I didn't even pay attention to the date.  I was thinking this was October business.  We will definitely be able to do somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 Stace,  Please look into your notes.  You entered deal 214948 each day for the purchases at this meter for the month.  The 12th and 13th are ok in Sitara. However, there is nothing for the 15th and 16th.  D 
 Jackie,  Please get with the East Desk on this.  If they agree, we can roll the deal.  D 
 Come by anytime today.  I've already made the check out.  I will be leaving early today (sick kids and wife at home), but I will leave the check and tickets on my desk.  D 
 This should be allocated to the liquids group's transport.  D

If you need anything else, or have any questions, let me know.  Daren 
 Hey, Dwight.  Everything is going fine here.  Thanks for your message.  I'm feeling pretty confident with how things are going.  I have received very positive feedback from my manager and my employees.  I have learned much from you, especially related to communication:  recognizing the different types of people, different ways to communicate.  And, I appreciate the time you've spent with me.  However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being. When I'm in need of some "managing expertise" in the future, I will give you a call.  Again, thanks for working with me.  Daren 
 I created #454057 for the flow at Mtr 5192.  Canny Conner is looking into mtr 6387.  I will let you know when he determines what we will be doing.  D   Aimee Lannou   10/26/2000 10:01 AM

 Susan,  Are you clear on what you need to do with this?  D 
 FYI.  You may want to check with someone to see if this will affect you this weekend.  D 
 Robert will be coming too.  He said that he will be buying your lunch, since you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year.   Just kidding.  D 
 We are on the 32nd floor now (Thru the glass door and turn right), if your badge still works.  Or, give me a call from the Lobby and I'll come get you.  Would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us (Carlos, Lauri, etc)? It doesn't matter to me.  D 
 On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to Duke Energy Field Services at Waha.  However, I entered the deal (#603484) under Duke Energy Marketing (Can you believe I made a mistake?).  To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under DEFS.  Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done.  Sorry for the extra work.  D 
 Lee,  On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.  D 
 We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a few days.  Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.  So, this will not have an impact on UA4.  D 
 Why don't you come to the office around 11:00.  (I'll be trading Waha until 10:30 or so.) You can come up and say "hi" to everyone.  Or, we can just meet in the lobby and walk over.  D 
 Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).  Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like that.  How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.  Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I don't change my ways.   D 
 FYI.  I changed the pricing on the September deal (#386540) to IF HSC-.05 from HSC GD.  D 
 JM,  Is the contract for this deal still valid?  I want to roll the deal for Sep and Oct.  D 
 You're right.  I have corrected the ticket.  D 
 done    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have created two new deals in Sitara.  You will need to get with someone in Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals for Jan-Sep.  The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward.  Deal #s:  144052 --> 440092 144049 --> 440093  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record of a spot deal with them for that day.  Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.  D 
 Consumer Price Index 
 JM,  The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in Sitara and a new line has been created for November.  Can you look into this please?  D 
 Has this been resolved?  D 
 I created deal #439909 for August.  Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.  Currently, we have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September?  D 
 Sandi,  The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).  In the event that we have to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV.  D 
 Megan,  For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement will occur at GD-.10.  Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this day.  Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal.  I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.  For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.  Due to operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday.  I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sandi,  Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will be adjusted yearly based on CPI.  Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do you agree with this?  D 
 Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say that Duke should be paying us for the gas.  I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard back from anyone.  This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct contract in place for the deal.  D 
 The price should be 3.56.  There had been alot of price and volume discussions for this gas day and 8/1/00.  I checked the notes and found that we actually settled at 3.56 instead of 3.58.  D 
 Heather,  I will have my group gather the names and I will forward them to you.  When do you need everything?  D 
 Matt,  Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range.  D 
 FYI.  Forward the info to me for anyone you want to send cards to. 
 Suzanne,  I was out last week, so I am just now getting back with you.  We primarliy served the Texas Desk commercial team, with about 10% of time spent on Producer Services.  The non routine activity should be allocated to the Texas Desk.  D 
 Carlos,  Can yuou get with Rebecca on this?  It seems like we took care of this earlier.  D 
 I had problems in getting the newest version of Access.  So, please see the attachement below related to the OPM Hours Survey. 
 Megan,  I have made these adjustments.  HOwever, I would like for you to double check August.  We knew that Pan Energy would be over delivering at Cotten Valley for 8/9/00 through the end of the month.  So I changed the pricing on the deal to the GD-.10 settlement price for that time period.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 I fixed it.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Done.  I could not seperate the excess charge and cashout charges under the demand expense.  They are combined on the ticket.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any problems with Ocean Energy.  Sorry.  D 
 These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange. However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, in order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.  Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in place.

 I rolled this deal for day one in October only.  Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.  D   Aimee Lannou   10/02/2000 10:49 AM 
 I am not going with AEP.  So please don't include me in your estimates.  D

 Melissa,  It would help us considerably if Vance would include the prices for new deals in the monthly nom.  In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas, we need to put the deals into Sitara.  We will enter spot deals with the info Vance gives us.  When the deals are ticketed, the risk group will adjust Sitara with the finalized terms.  Thanks for your help.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 I have entered the following deals into Sitara for October:  Camden Resources Inc. @ mtr 9858, 3000/day #420113  (This counterparty is not currently in the system) North Central Oil Corporation @ mtr 5228, 3000/day #420114  These deals have not been finalized as of yet.  But, I have entered them to assist us with managing our postion and scheduling the pipe.  Let me know if you have any quesitons.  D 
 Mark,  It looks like we will probably take over the Cornhusker deal in October.  So, I need you to get the following information for Lone Star, Williams, and Apache:  Contact Name Phone # Fax # Mailing address   We will be sending notices to these parties indicating our agency agreement with the plant (Tenaska IV Texas Partners Ltd.)  Additionally, we will need this information from the plant manager.  Please gather this information as soon as you can from Nancy Stivers.  Thanks.  D 
 Please adjust the deals in Sitara to reflect this change. D

Also, please look into Heatherlock.  Vance is noming gas for this deal.  However, the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag. When I tried to roll another month, I got a message that another contract was needed.  Thanks.  D 
 Done. 
 done. 
 FYI 
 KH,  HSC-.0825 is the correct price, based on the final agreement.  I have corrected the deal in Sitara.  D 
 KH,  We created deal 229758 a while back to correct this.  You will need to get Vol Mgmt to reallocate volumes from #157288 to this deal to close it out.  D 
 The Cleburne Plant will be down for an outage during the following time period:  9/24  1/2 day 9/25-10/4 entire day  So, we will have about 45,000/day to sell.  The supply costs are $2.777 for 25,000 & $2.742 for 20,000.  D 
 Please read the message below.  What do you think about increasing the fee?   D 
 Well, I got selected.  The judge estimated that we would probably be there through Friday.  I will be in the office each morning until 9:15 and may return some evenings.  If you need anything, you can leave me a voice mail or call Liz and Stacey.  D 
 FYI.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, 9/19/00, for jury duty.  Please contact Stacey Neuweiler (3952) or Liz Bellamy (6029) if you need anything.  D 
 Kris,  Please forward this to the appropriate person.  We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke (Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me know where we stand.  Thanks.  D 
 Nagesh ,  I would like to have the CPR Position Manager resorted for the TEXASMKT screen as Follows:  Houston Pipe Line East Texas Gas Systems NNGB Humble Gas Pipeline Channel Industries Gas Centana Pipeline Oasis Pipeline Comp PG&E Valero PG&E TECO Lone Star Gas Remaining pipelines in alphabetical order.

 I will be there.  D 
 Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with the customers.  Buy from Tenaska IV July 399763 Aug 399773  Sell to Tenaska Marketing July 399791 Aug 399797  Sell to ANP Aug 399814  The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".  Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany mail.  (I received both invoices this week)  I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.  D 
 Julie,  In Sitara, the following purchases expire with no evergreen flag.  Please let me know if this is correct for these contracts.  Deal 138094  -  ERAC     expires 10/31/00 Deal 113858  -  Teco Gas Processing     expires 12/31/00  D 
 Thanks. 
 Julie,  Please review deal 133010.  The deal shows evergreen, but nothing rolled to September.  D 
 Mary,  You can roll this if you need to.  I usually leave it up to logistics to update the trans usage tickets like this.  D 
 Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend from Texas.  I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members of the group attended this first meeting (Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae). Russ will set up another session at a future date for others (Tom, Eddie, Mark).  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Russ,  We will send Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae to this training.  Thanks.  D 
 Pat,  I think that we should probably send the newest people to the first training.  What do you think?  Liz, Susan, Mary, Sabrae?  D 
 Gary,  Please call Pat Anderson with Southern Union as soon as possible regarding the info listed below.  She wants to work a fixed price swap for 25% of their booked volume for July '01 - Oct '02.  D 
 CR,  Can you get with Duke and see if this gas should have been at Centana into Mobil instead of HPL?  D 
 done. 
 Russ,  I would like for the following people from the Texas region to attend:  Liz Bellamy Sabrae Zajak Mary Poorman Susan Hadix Tom Acton Mark McCoy Eddie Janzen  Let me know if this group is too large and move some to a later date.  Thanks.  D 
 Robert,  There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company? Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract and HPL contract?  D 
 Marlene,  Stacey put the contracts in intercompany mail before I got this notice. Sorry.  Send them to us again and we will get them signed and returned quickly.  D 
 You must've had a rough weekend.  I haven't seen this many screwed up e-mails from you in a while.  Or...is that 110 degree heat finally taking it's toll? 
 dfarmer get2work 
 Marlene,  After discussions with the desk, we have decided to keep the Oasis contracts under ENA.  So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 March Midcon volumes at Mobil should be 30,000 each day.  Any swings should be on the buyback HPL has with Mobil.  D 
 I rolled deal 331917.   Aimee Lannou   09/05/2000 11:04 AM 
 Done. 
 I corrected the deal.  The price should be Waha Index +.01.  D 
 I do not have Access on my system.  D 
 See Below in Blue.  Thanks for your help.  D 
 Katherine,  There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara: 1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.  2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.  Let me know how you want to handle it.  D 
 You may want to come to this meeting.  When we met with Bob Hall the other dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were occurring each month.  If you have something else going on, don't worry about being there.  I'll relay the info to you.  D 
 Lee,  FYI.  Enron Methanol has been taking about 5,000 swing each day for August. So, I added 5,000 for September (#139057 @ GD) in addition to the 34,000 they nom'd.  D 
 Jackie,  What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.  D 
 You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)  D 
 Please see the attached Tufco file for July.  The 2,500 under the Wagner Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that day).  This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also. Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 These deals should be converted to ENA-IM Texas.  Is there a way that you can change all of these deals systematically?  D 
 I am calculating that only 44,374 should be applied to the HPLR IFERC contract at the Tap to finish the obligation for the month.  D 
 Melissa,  Lone Star is showing the LS HPL LSK IC at zero for 7/24.  We have it in as 2,500, as you do in this e-mail.  Please look into your Lone Star transport on this date and let me know what you find.  Thanks.  D 
 Who does Lone Star show as the transporter on their side, if anyone?  Do we have an OBA at this point?  D 
 No, we have transported on Tejas a few times this year also (on and off). Carlos should be able to tell you when.  D 
 I rolled ceal 329242 for Aug 1.  D 
 I will play again, but not on Wednesday nights.  Any other night is fine.  D 
 This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL. However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.  Daren    Enron North America Corp. 
 Which direction should I go on 610?    Aimee Lannou   08/16/2000 04:47 PM 
 Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.  Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.  Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.  D 
 I'll be there. 
 Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.  We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 The new fixed price deal with Equistar is #365013.  D 
 Melissa,  I show that we also had 20.000 at LS HPL for the 13th.  Daren 
 I'm working hard for you!  Now at 83.5.  I need a new lawnmower, so I'll try to bump it up a little more.  Hope you're doing good.  D 
 These have been sold. 
 Is this single or double elimination? 
 John,  I need information on the following questions related to Cornhusker:  1)  I understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of the supply, transport, and sales contracts.  Who will be handling the financiol accounting  and reporting for these deals?  2)  Is someone in Legal currently assigning the contracts to ENA?  3)  What is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant?  4)  Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the pipeline for July and August activity.  Is this true?  I thought we weren't taking responsibility for this until September business.  We are not prepared to pay the suppliers for July.  5)  Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book?  Thanks.  Daren 
 I believe the counterparty changed effective 2/1/01 to El Paso Merchant Energy.  See deals 637225 and 637234.  D 
 An adjustment is required on the Tufco contract for July 2000.  The volume for the 23rd was overstated by 5,000.  This resulted in revisions on the 23rd and 28th.  Please see the attached Tufco.  If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.  D 
 Test reply. 
 Mary,  These are transport related tickets.  Is this something that your group would look into?  D 
 I'm already schedule for another meeting from 1-2:30 on Thurs.  I am open after that.  D 
 The measurements: 38x54 38x66 with fold-out leaf  The wood is pretty dark.  I have a couple of pictures at EB 3211F if you want to see them. 
 B,  I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:  1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to discuss information with me.  2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top of this now.  Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.  D 
 FYI 
 The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should be schueduled on this deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Bob and Mary,  Please talk to Vance Taylor about this.  Daren 
 I'll be there.  I mean it this time.  Really.  D 
 Julie,  You need to keep the nom and confirm at 3000 so that the buyback calculation will work correctly.  D 
 Name Tags:  Daren Farmer Tonya Farmer 
 Dave,  This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.  We did not get this info., so Sitara was not adjusted.  D 
 We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd. So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.  D 
 See registration form below. 
 Mary,  Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in July, so we should not be receiving anything.  D 
 Finney,  Congratulations on the new baby!  Are you sure you picked up the right one at the hospital?  She is too cute to have anything to do with you.  Hope everybody is doing good and ya'll are getting at least a little sleep.  Daren 
 Nicole, The correct price is 4.50.  I changed the deal ticket.  D 
 I don't have any problems with this.  D 
 I'll be there. 
 In order to account for the same day change at Katy, please schedule the following deals for 7/24/00 only:  At Exxon Katy (Mtr 4132):  Allocate -0- to deal 284599 Allocated 4,500 to deal 339604  At Lone Star Katy (Mtr 67): Allocate 5,000 to deal 341801(new deal) Allocate 5,500 to deal 341808 (new deal)   Please remember that EOL deals are firm.  This means that we can't change the location, volume, or price on these deals.  If questions arise around an EOL deal, please make sure that your audience (traders, myself, etc.) knows that your are discussing an EOL trade.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 I created a new deal to capture this flow.  #333712 I also created a deal for July, #333718.   D 
 Esther,  Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've invited him on.  Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.  The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.  I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.  I will probably have to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.  If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.  Daren 
 Done.  D 
 Hillary,  Can we extend deal 77352 for the rest of the year?  I tried to do this, but I got the message to add a contract.  This deal is set up in case GSF needs compressor fuel and should roll each month.  However, there is no line for July.  D

 I recevied a note from Janet Wallis stating that we need Gas Daily deals for imbalances at Colorado River Station (Mtr 8663) for Nov 99 and Mar 00.  I changed the pricing on the term deal 72349 to Gas Daily + .199 to cover these flows.  HC - Please have someone allocate the needed volumes to this deal ticket for these two months, and let Katherine know when completed.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 I believe that I have received your message in error. My name is Daren Farmer and I work in the Texas gas trading area for Enron.  If you will send the name of the person and department you are trying to contact at Enron, I will assist you in communicating with that person.  Thanks.  Daren Farmer 
 You need to discuss this with the East Desk.  See if Tetco allocated the vol to their contract.  D 
 During June, Coral transacted on EOL.  However, they selected a July thru October deal by mistake.  The marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in EOL.  Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound.  But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price.  Logistics will be brokering the transactions in MOPS.  Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals. Again, they will not have a record of the deals.  The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653.  Let me know if you have any questions.  D 
 Bob,  Update our nom in Sitara to agree with their's.  D    Enron North America Corp. 
 Can you set up a GTC with Duke Energy Field Services,Inc.  for May -July 2000?  D 
 Gary,  Does the workhseet mentioned below assist you with the monthly operations related to the industrial customers?  D 
 I have rolled # 143559 through July 2000 to cover the purchase from Republic.  We sell this gas to Duke Energy Field Services (#143558 for Jan - Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC.  Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke counterparty to this deal.  If you have any questions, let me know.  D 
 When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th. (Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.  Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and schedulers on call.  Let me know what you think.  D 
 We did not sale to Conoco on 5/5/00.  D 
 Brandee,  You're in the system now.  thanks.  D 
 Sitara #139066 has a max of 9500 in the flex nom.  Is this correct?  Should the additional 1500 be on a swing ticket or included on the index ticket?  D 
 Deal 93200 covers this meter.  However, we have a zero as the expected volume.  You can select "always send nom" in MOPS to get this to come over in POPS.  D   Aimee Lannou                06/21/2000 08:26 AM
