 Susan Zilker Salons of Post Oak. 
 I was not aware that you were having  problems.  This is the first I have heard of them.  I do not know Cliff Jackson and I am unable to control his actions.  I am not even sure if he works for ETS.   In the future,  if you are having problems, please contact someone in my department, Judy Lin, Mary Botello or James Weitekamp.   Please provide me with a complete list of the things you need and we will be more than happy to work with you.  Tracy 
 Lets get together to discuss billing of interest to EOTT. 
 I am not sure what this is.  I thought we were billing the costs down to a legal entity.  This does not tie to the numbers Elise gave us. 
 I would think what you are charging should include benefits and payroll taxes as they are part of employee expenses.  I don't think there is a way in SAP to stop that from happening unless it is a manual entry. 
 You should probably come to this or someone from Steve's group. 
 Shouldn't Julia White attend this?  After all she is gas control and I think they should be represented.  Should I ask Steve Harris this question? 
 What do you think? 
 Please take me off your distribution list for monthly close contacts.   Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
 are you on this distribution?

 La Strada?  What about Sierra Grill on Montrose?  I don't much care for Michaelangelos.  Vincents or Ninos? 
 I assume you will answer this.  Thanks 
 I think its March 6.  I threw the letter away. 
 Are you going to the room parent meeting tomorrow morning? 
 Please provide list of names to John Keiser.  I will not be attending this session.  I will be in Omaha.  Thanks 
 Steve Harris has his group meeting some where and they have hired a bus to take them to and from the rodeo.  Just a suggestion. 
 Put me in for Diana Ross.  Do we get to invite our spouses? 
 In the future, please work with Jennifer Lev's group.  She handles the accounting for this entity for Enron.  Thanks     Sheila Howard 02/05/2001 12:45 PM 
 Karl Jackson is at EOTT.  They have access to SAP in order to retrieve data for Co 1195.  Can you let him know when he can extract data?  We need to see it they want us to continue to send them a bill for Co 1195 (bill for all CASH spent).  We also need to discuss you guys sending an invoice for interest.  Thanks 
 Can you help her out. 
 Find out where this meeting on Tuesday and please attend for me. 
 No problem. 
 I do not think I need to attend this.  Let me know if you feel otherwise.  Thanks 
 Please take care of this.  Pay within the next week.  Charge Co 366  CC 111723.  Thanks 
 I can speak on your behalf.  I have left your numbers flat to plan.  You might want to sit in just to see how he wants to handle this going forward and how all of this fits together.  I will be sending you the schedules within the next few minutes.

 We will be meeting on Wednesday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 in 47C2. 
 what did you think 
 This unfortunately is true.  We, ETS, have agreed to an amount which is flat to previous years.  The IT has new managment in, primarily Kerry Roper formerly Clean Fuels, to try to fix or actually create a billing system similar to what we had.  Rod and Steve Hotte have been involved in this.  At this point in time, there is not a better alternative.  Tracy 
 okey 
 I would like to include Rod Hayslett as well.  I will book 49C2 on 2/7 from 9-11 if everyone is available. 
 We have resolved this issue. 
 For your approval.  Laura said there was not really a deadline for this. 
 Check against functional income statement and Co 366 schedules 
 Feb. 10? 
 1999 = 9,182 Bbtu/d 2000 = 9,130 Bbtu/d  Decline due to Northern Natural Gas lower south end volumes and lower offshore volumes.  Lower volumes does not necessarily mean lower revenues.  NNG's revenues are over 85% fixed.  The south end volumes have a very low transport rate as well.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

 Are you guys going to the West U Park Lover's Ball? 
 I am not speaking of capital, only O & M.  I really need a list of all items on the balance sheet for reserves, def. charges etc.  I need to know when they will turn, what they are for and if they are in your 2001 plan.  thanks 
 Please verify numbers.  Thanks Tracy 
 thanks 
 congratulations!!!! 
 I will let you know when I have the company set up in SAP (the accounting system).  You can still do business, I just can't record any transactions.  This should only take one week.  Tracy 
 I need the company listed below set up in SAP.  The parent is 1N9.  The name of the company is Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp.  It will need one profit center and one cost center at this time.  Please let me know when the set up is complete.  Thanks 
 no exceptions.  How is the calendar coming for my group.  I would like to review with you by the end of the week.  Thanks 
 I need a list of all 2000 dollars that we carried into 2001 by Wednesday.  You can round to the nearest $100,000.  Let me know if they are in the 2001 plan or not.  Thanks  Tracy 
 Its being rescheduled.

 This is the new company the TW people set up.  They set it up as subsidiary of TW.  Moran is okey with that. 
 I don't think I will be able to make it.  I talked to Shelley on Friday and she is sending Kim Nelson in her place. 
 What do you think? 
 This should be charged to the ENA HPL not Co 584. 
 Sophie said she gave you coding a couple of weeks ago for me. 
 Lets meet and we will probably have some follow up.  Thanks 
 I don't know if we want to change accounting methodology.  Your call. 
 lets make sure we save these on the lan. 
 okey 
 The location is EB 3907. 
 Sharon,  Garret will go home with Brett Gutstein on Tuesday, Feb. 27.  Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
 I think we really need to have this meeting.  We have some issues we need to discuss.  I have had a tough time getting these people together.  Do both of you need to attend the other meeting? 
 Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss TW maintenance scheduled for this year.  We would like to discuss when the maintenance will be, the duration, and what will be done.  Please be prepared to discuss any savings we will have from the plan for maintenance that will not have to be done because of our planned expansion (capital and expense.)  We will be meeting on Monday, February 26 at 3:00.  I will send out the location later today.  Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
 can you complrtr for me 
 fyi add the VPs listed belowto our calendar distribution if we have any changes. 
 Steve Harris said that he has not agreed to this amount.  I thought Steve Hotte had buy in from everyone???

 I thought we were supposed to use XMS new system? 
 I understand.  I will call you for lunch later.  thanks 
 Call me and lets discuss 
 Diane,  I have all the parent volunteers for the zoo trip lined up.  Do you need anything else for the trip, i.e. juice boxes, etc.?  Let me know and we will have it for you.  Tracy Geaccone 
 thanks for the heads up!!! 
 Pat, you may be interested in this from a gross/net perspective. 
 Danny,  The attached below is where we will be for margins.  This is what we talked about last week.   The other expenses associated with commercial seem to be flat to plan.   I do not have anything else for you at this time.  I should have something by tomorrow and I will send to Julie.  Thanks  Tracy 
 Laura,  Judy should have been listed as CP17 in the PRC.  Her bonus shuld have been $5,600 which falls in the low range of the level for someone ranked a 3.  Please take care of this for me.   Thanks  Tracy Geaccone 
 I think we should show margins and expense and come down to net contribution.  I think it be important to maintain the margin stuff separately.  We also should show the assets sales and others separately. 
 These are different th
