 Hey Reggie,  How are you doing?  I don't know if you remember me but I was a friend of Chris Larson's.  I was wondering what you  guys are going to do with the furniture and the flat screens?  Do you need any help selling them?  Will you offer any to the employees?  I know you are busy in these times.  If you get a chance, call me at x.36247 or at home (713) 527-8743.  Thank you and have a great day.  Hope all is well with you and your family.  John Griffith 
 Steven,  John Arnold asked me to send you this report.  It is from our position on 11/2/01.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I can be reached via email or by phone (713) 853-6247.  Thanks.  John Griffith 
 John,  Thank you for pulling me aside and reinforcing your confidence in me and also putting things into perspective.  I guess the reason I was a little upset is that I feel that we are a family here.  I spend more time with you guys than I do with my wife.  I felt a little betrayed.  I should not have felt that way.  You guys have given me the oppurtunity of a lifetime, I am very thankful for that.  I have never questioned the importance of you or Mike of anyone on our desk.  Please forgive me if I have been a little down.  I think that I am truly okay now.  It has been a very emotional couple of weeks with everything going on.  I know we will get through this.  I once again want to tell you that I am here for anything that needs to be done.  You will not here about this situation again.  Thank you for understanding.  I put my total trust in you.  John
