 Kent, If we do so, I would assume that the reasoning is based as much on pricing as it is on volumetrics.  What are Jo and Larry's views on the market at this point?  Dan 
 Rod, I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".  I just don't know if we'll be ready.  I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.  Also, Greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.  Therefore, I'd like to start getting Tim DeSpain involved.  Does that make sense?  Dan 
 Rod, I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock. I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.  Dan 
 But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??

 I noticed that several people were left off of Stan's attempt at an organizational chart.  Please forgive the oversight and don't read anything into it, as our organization hasn't changed. Thanks.  Dan

 Guys, Several of our people have PROFITEX installed on their computers at a monthly rate of $135/mo S. Harris, K. Miller, S. Neville, R. Cabrera, R. Preston, R. Paladino, J. Prichard, L. Pavlou).  If it is not necessary for the performance of their jobs, have the service terminated for the respective user.  Thanks.  Dan

 But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage. 
 Drew, The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.  Dan 
 John, Just one suggestion. I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.  In the first paragraph, final sentence, could we change it to read "These actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults, and to preserve the value in our core energy business".  Dan 
 Greg, I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.  He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.  This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.  Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay. Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.  Dan 
 Stan, As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.  Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being. If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value. Let me know your thoughts on this one.  Dan 
 Richard, Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so. Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.  Dan 
 No, and I'd like to know who in my group is using it for 135.31/mo.  Can they tell me that?  Dan 
 All, As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.  Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.  Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.  Upon completion, please forward it to me.  Dan 
 Brian, I didn't hear back on the PPA for Julie Armstrong.  Is it scheduled to be paid?  Dan 
 See if you can figure out how to get into this??  Dan 
 Steve, This is landing at a bad time.  I'm going to be in Omaha going over the 2002 plan, and doing other business.  Unfortunately, I cannot reschedule this one so I'll have to miss the Wine fest. 
 Stan, Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.  We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and Lorraine would sell for incremental revenue.  If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.  Agreed?  Dan 
 Guys, We need to terminate this (unilaterally if possible, or if not, bilaterally) and move towards settlement now (it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which I believe will be on Monday).  Who is not being responsive? I'll track them down and get an answer if I have to. I think that we're too late for today, so let's do it in the morning.  Dan 
 Rod, I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap.  I'll let you know when I have them.  Dan 
 Ken, I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.  Dan 
 Eric, Do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in?  Dan 
 Cindy, Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.  Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.  Thanks.  If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.  Dan 
 fyi

 Dave, FYI. I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination. Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything. How can we get these answers?  Dan -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 Rick, I thought that there was $553,000 due from ENA for November capacity release.  Who are the original shippers on the other $348,000?  Dan 
 Rick, I guess that we are going to be s.o.l. as an unsecured creditor on the $129,000.  How do we get to the $226,350 where they acted as agent.  Can we go direct to the beneficiaries?  Whatever can be done needs to be done fast, because people, money and paperwork seem to be disappearing around ENA's shop.  Dan 
 Bob, I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  Brian really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). As for enemies at Enron---I think that they are all gone (Ken, Amanda, Cliff, John Stokes and crew).  I think that Mark Frevert still thinks highly of Brian and understands that Brian was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the Ken and Amanda thing). I do know that Brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very Christian and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me. Let me know if I can help further.  Dan 
 Cindy, I will handle and respond to the attached. Dan 
 Guys, Fran Fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 2001 and a worksheet for 2002 merit increases.  Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to Fran Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:  1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels. 2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, Stan, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good. 3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.

 Fran, If Julie's merit needs to be lump sum, just move it over to that column.  Also, send me Eric Gadd's sheets as well.  Thanks. Dan 
 Steve, It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance.  I have an extra $24,500 that you can have now.  Use it if you need to.  Dan 
 Eric, I'd suggest: Janet Place--Legal Mary Kay Miller--regulatory Technical--???  talk with Phil MOU--You Sound O.K.? Dan 
 Stan, I just glanced at your new org. chart and thought I'd make a comment (or really more of an observation).  Jesus had 12 direct reports and screwed up on one of them, so while I agree that a flat organisation is best, I think that you'd better be very careful or you get a godlike ego.  Dan 
 Brian, If that is the case, I think that I have $0 left.  There was a request earlier this week for  $750 from NNG.  I guess we'll have to put this on hold for now.  I'll get back with Steve Harris.  Dan 
 Since to bulk of these will be used for employees, I'd like to try and get 20-plus tickets through Deb---not hospitality ones.

 Cindy, No.  I'll give her mine and Eric's.  I fear that if she has Stan's, he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level, and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority.  Dan

 SOOOO--Is it really too late to consider a disaster recovery site that would be safer than Ardmore in the event of flood, bio-terrorism, or other crazy attack, that would be marketable to other companies??

 John, I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?  Dan 
 John, That is fine, but I'd also like to see current month to Plan as well, as this will be of particular interest next year. Dan 
 Mary Kay, I still haven't forgotten--I'm talking with Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon, and I'll let you know. Dan
