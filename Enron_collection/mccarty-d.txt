 Kent, If we do so, I would assume that the reasoning is based as much on pricing as it is on volumetrics.  What are Jo and Larry's views on the market at this point?  Dan 
 Rod, I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".  I just don't know if we'll be ready.  I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.  Also, Greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.  Therefore, I'd like to start getting Tim DeSpain involved.  Does that make sense?  Dan 
 Rod, I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock. I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.  Dan 
 But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??

 I noticed that several people were left off of Stan's attempt at an organizational chart.  Please forgive the oversight and don't read anything into it, as our organization hasn't changed. Thanks.  Dan 
 Rod, I've had this removed from numerous users so far due to the cost.  We'll have this down to three or four users in the next week or so.  Dan 
 Guys, Several of our people have PROFITEX installed on their computers at a monthly rate of $135/mo S. Harris, K. Miller, S. Neville, R. Cabrera, R. Preston, R. Paladino, J. Prichard, L. Pavlou).  If it is not necessary for the performance of their jobs, have the service terminated for the respective user.  Thanks.  Dan

 But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage. 
 Drew, The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.  Dan 
 John, Just one suggestion. I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.  In the first paragraph, final sentence, could we change it to read "These actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults, and to preserve the value in our core energy business".  Dan 
 Greg, I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.  He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.  This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.  Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay. Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.  Dan 
 Stan, As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.  Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being. If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value. Let me know your thoughts on this one.  Dan 
 Richard, Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so. Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.  Dan 
 No, and I'd like to know who in my group is using it for 135.31/mo.  Can they tell me that?  Dan 
 All, As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.  Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.  Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.  Upon completion, please forward it to me.  Dan 
 Brian, I didn't hear back on the PPA for Julie Armstron
