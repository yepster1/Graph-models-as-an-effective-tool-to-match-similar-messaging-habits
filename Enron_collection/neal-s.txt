 David,  I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something like " then click on the Transaction History tab at the top of the screen" might be helpful. 
 I look forward to seeing this summer. 
 I talked with Chris Holmes last week and got very positive feedback about your interviews.  I told him about our working together in Argentina and your activities down there and gave him an overview of your skill set.  I have left a message with Mike Moore but he is out of town and he has not returned my call yet. I hope all is well with you.  I will call or email when I talk with the others.  Sincerely,  Scott

 Andrea,  The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference.  thanks,  Scott   - new leo's resume.doc  - resume1.doc 
 Also, send me a copy of your resume.  thanks. 
 All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is the person I contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the email, I look forward to seeing you this summer.  Scott 
 I will send her a note right now.

 The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour.  You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful. Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions. 
 please forward to everyone on the East Desk. thanks, scott 
 I really don't have a clue.  However,it seems that most of the costs are generally fixed - people, systems, etc. 
 pay only the $1750 referenced below to Robin Barbie from my book. 
 please pay this origination from my book to Robin. 
 Hi Rolo,  I am glad to hear from you.  Yes, Sao Paulo is muy grande con muchos macacos.  Everything is going fine here.  Do you have any trips to the US planned?  I have not be playing much golf, too cold and rainy here so far this winter, but spring is near.  Stay in touch and good luck.  Scott

 John,  Please find attached the resume of Angie Zeman, who is an analyst working a rotation in East Gas Logistics.  She is an outstanding perfromer and is interested in pursuing opportunities  in London.  Who is the best person in your organization to communicate her interest and my recommendation?  Thanks.  Scott 
 Tammy,  Sean can help us with customized EOL reports.  Scott 
 thanks chris. 
 1)  Is this deal done? 2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed. 3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point of view? 4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?     Enron North America Corp. 
 I don't know him. 
 talked with Ryan last week.  he is thrilled and looking forward to working with us. 
 Let's set up a meeting to discuss.  The Wellhead Group is responsible for everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jennifer Milligan will be contacting regarding the intern program.  She will probably want a resume from you. Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing, research, etc.)  you have interest in working.  Please keep me up to date once she contacts you.  Sincerely,  Scott 
 Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well. He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would recommend him highly. 
 yes i want to contribute, and thank you for doing this.    Enron North America Corp. 
 no problem 
 de nada, che!

 Haven't forgot about you yet.  I will have the information for you this week.  Thank you for your persistence and patience.  Sincerely,  Scott 
 Any ideas on who to talk to regarding a possible summer internship?  Scott 
 I have 3 addtional candidates for consideration:  Seung-taek Oh (Associate - Credit Derivatives) Scott Loving   (East Logistics) Eric Boyt   ( Gas Structuring) 
 We will get working on this.  I have no problem with you sitting in on the PRC process.  We are scheduled to have this meeting on Nov. 29, however I think there is some chance this date might change due to bid week activities. 
 I have prepared  a recommendation letter as  you have requested.  It is my pleasure to do so.  Please advise as to when to send, etc.  I am available to visit on the phone any time after 2:3opm any day this week.  However, I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday Nov. 16-17. 
 Jim,  Any thoughts or guidance on the question below?  Scott 
 Just a thought - but we will still be finishing up bid week on Nov. 29.  Any ideas about the first week in December. 
 what is this approval for? 
 I will plan on seeing you here tomorrow or Thursday. 
 philly,  what's the story?  escotty 
 please follow up on this potential deal. 
 I have not had any contact from anyone in Europe regarding you previous email. 
 I don't have any plans to travel down there at this point.  But if this changes I will let you know and would love to play some golf.

 All of  the NYMEX natural gas swap products are very active as well as  the Gas Daily - Henry Hub prompt month. Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Itinerary for each of the Super Saturdays. 
 we need to participate in this interview process.  let me know if and when= =20 you can participate.  sign up at the web site listed below. =20 
 thank you for your help. 
 Corina,  Are the times the same for the Super Saturday on Nov.4? 
 I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating. I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments.  Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.  Sincerely,  Scott Neal 
 fyi we have 2 weeks to check this out without cost.  maybe we can get additional ideas about how we incorporate capacity trading into EOL. 
 I meant 2001. 
 I would like each of you to list your top 5-10 target customers for 2000 by 12pm tomorrow.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

 please see a draft of the proposed rules and trading ticket.  please let me know if you have any questions or comments. 
 let's discuss what info might be helpful. 
 How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas Daily and which group will hold this risk? Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering system?      Enron North America Corp.

 Jana,  Would it be possible to provide me with a list of all analysts working within ENA (along with their current assignments)?  Thank you.
