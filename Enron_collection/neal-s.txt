 David,  I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something like " then click on the Transaction History tab at the top of the screen" might be helpful.

 I talked with Chris Holmes last week and got very positive feedback about your interviews.

 All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is the person I contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the email, I look forward to seeing you this summer.  Scott

 The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour.  You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful. Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions. 
 please forward to everyone on the East Desk. thanks, scott 
 I really don't have a clue.  However,it seems that most of the costs are generally fixed - people, systems, etc. 
 pay only the $1750 referenced below to Robin Barbie from my book.

 1)  Is this deal done? 2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed. 3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point of view? 4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?     Enron North America Corp. 
 I don't know him. 
 talked with Ryan last week.  he is thrilled and looking forward to working with us. 
 Let's set up a meeting to discuss.  The Wellhead Group is responsible for everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jennifer Milligan will be contacting regarding the intern program.  She will probably want a resume from you. Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing, research, etc.)  you have interest in working.  Please keep me up to date once she contacts you.  Sincerely,  Scott 
 Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well. He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would recommend him highly.

 thank you for your help. 
 Corina,  Are the times the same for the Super Saturday on Nov.4? 
 I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating. I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments.  Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.  Sincerely,  Scott Neal

 Jana,  Would it be possible to provide me with a list of all analysts working within ENA (along with their current assignments)?  Thank you.

 US Govt. data -   Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1% rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low. In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July, double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing. > 
 I think his interest is a marketing/oringination/business development role.

 A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.  1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to replace Access and to handle basis trading.

The basis products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.  2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board in the    next few weeks.  3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the weekly storage data.  4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount through the Hub for volume commitment.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

 Network Appliance Selects TIBCO Software to Support Enterprise System Initiatives  TIBCO Technology Enables Network Appliance to Integrate Its Internal Enterprise Systems Without Disrupting Its Business  PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX - news), a leading provider of real-time infrastructure software for e-business, announced today Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP - news), the leading provider of network-attached data access and content management solutions, has selected the TIBCO ActiveEnterprisec e-business product suite to integrate its internal enterprise systems and applications.

 riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time  Company Press Release  SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission  Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC  FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.  In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15.  ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''  According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts.  Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm capacity. Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with a different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time before a binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.  Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERC's Order 637.  *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST). *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non- discriminatory basis. *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet. *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available. *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied. *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to all bidders through an Internet-based system.   ``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all parties as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.  Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.  Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.  Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and electric power generation.

 Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..  Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows interest in learning. 
 thanks for the info.
