 Sounds good to me.  Make me a plate, remember I have a 9 basketball game, so I will be home about 10:30. PL 
 I want to play on the motley side.  I am off work the next day, so I will try and make it. PL 
 Thanks.  I know for a fact he felt the same way. PL 
 Actually I was told it was a military invention and that we simply licensed the technology rights. PL 
 I don't have to be talking about basketball to get the pattern...I am sorry, I didn't realize your girl told you about our morning routines. PL 
 I understand Mick's point of view...So for everyone, I will also share my day...Get out of bed, shower, brush teeth, comb hair, don't forget that deodrant(that's both arms)...Take the bus..book deals til 5 p.m. and calc three books....Get the point.  We are all busy, welcome to Enron.  I think the point of the message, which I think should be directed at a few individuals that have shown a pattern..DON'T COMMITT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT INTEND TO DELIVER UPON. PL 
 thanks man.  I will let you know. 
 We are in bid week right now, so I have to work late and can not take vacation, so I am catching a 10 p.m. flight out tomorrow and get to auburn about 2 a.m.  I will be at your brother's by 7:15 a.m. on game day - you better be ready.  I am coming in on Thursday night for the Georgia game and may stay in Birmingham that night...any vacancies?  I think we may play golf on Friday. PL 
 bring it.  I guess you are right, you don't need tickets, hope you don't need any the rest of the season.  I give you that whoopin at the bar this weekend. PL 
 The hell you did...don't be a dumb ass.(you need to remember who is giving you tickets this weekend). PL 
 I do not mind us bringing JAckson.  I understand your desire to be with him all the time, but I would like to occasionally do something with our friends for a vacation that is just us.  I think in time you will become more comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.  You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.  If we go we need to make plans for barkley.  Bundle Jackson up this morning it is near freezing.  Please cover the plants out back.  Thanks. PL 
 He led the nation last year -JUCO- in rushing and touchdowns and was JUCO player of the year.  He went to Butler JUCO and led them to a national championship.  In the national championship game, he had 300 yards and 7 touchdowns.  He has 3 touchdowns so far this year over 70 yards.  He is a welcome addition to our poor running game. PL 
 I can always count on you to put a unique spin on something.  I am more concerned with him staying for his senior year. PL 
 From all I have read, he seems to always thank his offensive line and recievers first.  I heard that is what he said as soon as he got the game ball Saturday. PL 
 Pretty damn funny. PL 
 Tim Duncan is what ever the draft personnel categorize him as.  Guranteed victories?? What is your record this year thrill kill?  What was your record in basketball?  Enough said. PL 
 I bid $3 on Troy Drayton PL 
 I guess I would be in, what is the fee going to be.  It is a crap load of work. PL 
 FYI. PL 
 The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.  It appears the files were not prepared by risk.  I have prepared the files and attached them.  Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing? Thanks for your help, please call with questions. PL 
 I will be there. PL 
 How ashamed I am to read this. PL 
 That really embarasses me. PL 
 I ran a forwards detail for you on the deal from friday Q52255.1, price of 3.85.  This deal is currently losing roughly $3,000. PL 
 We are having so much fun, we do not know what to do with ourselves.  The P&L's are hosed, we are going to Fletch's happy hour now, maybe the numbers will make sense after that. PL 
 I do not think I will be able to attend due to bid week.  We are usually extremely busy during bidweek and we will be short handed.  Please advise of any future sessions.  Thanks. PL 
 Yeah man, tell me about that crazy night before.  You know us married guys have to live vicariously through our single friends.  Next time you are headed this way, please do give me a shout, we will have to get together and catch up.  We can shoot a little pool at my house or go out to a bar.  Good luck with the financing, please keep me informed.  Thanks for the nice thoughts, same goes from me bro, I have been thinking about you for some time and hoping things were going well, I am glad they are going well. PL 
 Pretty humorous. PL 
 Does Denise have any interest in learning to ski?  I think it is an absolute blast.  How are the negotiations going between Gwynn and the Padres? PL 
 I vote for a long lunch one day of the week or 6 p.m. on Monday or 6 p.m. on Wednesday PL 
 I agree with you.  We are going skiing in January.  If ya'll want to come or come to a football game in the fall.  I am not sure if we can make it out there before the end of the year.  I have spoken for all of my vacation days.  Did you see the sorry Astros released Cami today?  The man gave up all of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out him.  Typical Drayton McClain.  Talk to you tomorrow. PL 
 I know what you mean.  As far as the bed goes, you should do what I do...Go around to the other side and push your wife into the wet area. PL 
 Is it 6 a.m. out there?  What in the hell are you already doing at work? PL 
 Done.  FYI, according to Trey, this does not go through ECC because it is physical..do you agree? I changed sitara as well. PL 
 A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.  I then went around to everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in everyone's pocket.  If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince them, let me know.  By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?  DO I have to wait until the end of the season. PL 
 Did you see the first three games of the divisional series?  4 of the 6 starters were former Astro pitchers - within the last three years.  Halama, Garcia for Seattle - Randy Johnson trade, Hampton and Kyle.  How sickening is that.  However, McClain has said he is going to up the budget for next year by....1 MILLION $, yee haw. PL 
 Welcome back. PL 
 DONE. PL 
 Glad to hear this.  read the whole story, hopefully it is true. PL 
 Yes, I did get in touch with him.  Thanks again for the info.  He is just being a beach bum...not really doing anything.  Guess I should have figured that. PL 
 Sorry.  I have always listed the address as plove @enron.com  How are things going with you?  Good I hope.  We just got back from Denver.  Rachel Bonilla's wedding.  Boy the weather and the air are beautiful up there.  We really considered moving. PL 
 We do look pretty bad.  As long as we win that game at the end of November...I will be happy.  How was the trip to NYC?  I bet you guys had a blast. PL 
 Send those dirty jokes to my home email - plove570@cs.com.  They are pretty ruthless here about offensive emails.  I still want to see the jokes though. Are you still enjoying the computer?  I need to spend some time getting our home machine organized.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Sent to wrong address originally. PL 
 There has been a slight change to our email addresses.  Please send future emails to phillip.m.love@enron.com Thanks. PL 
 can you reverify the deal ID.  Is this the EOL #, EOL number are above 490000 right now.  Thanks. PL 
 You need to stop lying to these boys, you know damn well this old guy was with you step for step. PL 
 Hey man, our new address is: 4435 Sterling Wood Way Houston, TX  77059  PL 
 When are you running for office Eric, you have my vote. PL 
 I think that last comment should have been directed solely to O'Neal. PL 
 Man, I was needing some help this week.... 
 Here they are. PL 
 How does Fear have any money left...he has been bidding the house...I think we need some bid accounting here. PL 
 I do not know who you are, but I definitely do not appreciate the email that you sent me.  I do not agree with your politics and please remove me from your list. 
 Here they are.  Look how large some people are (Leo and Mitchell).  I managed to stay clear of the photos. PL 
 Thanks for your help, I will keep that in mind. PL 
 If he did that, he might have come back with a little buckshot in his ass. PL 
 I will throw in Troy Brown, Kevin Johnson and James Allen. PL 
 How about Jacques Green and Mike Alstot. PL 
 I think it is arabic for holy shit, I broke my shoulder. 
 It is an absolutely hilarious video of a pakistani man firing a shotgun in a range and the gun shooting out of his hand and him yelling at his friends. Real player should be able to play it - that is what I used.  I had a good time.  Send me those pics.  It was great seeing everybody and give us a shout the next time you are in town. PL 
 Yeah, waht are you offering? PL 
 I found this picture of you shooting a shotgun, you crazy man. PL 
 Enjoy..I was crying with laughter. PL 
 Just curious how I may assist in getting Auburn University's name added to recruiting endeavors.  Of course I am an alum, and I believe you will find we have an excellent engineering and business school.  Just curious, thanks. PL 
 Here it is...you gonna split the money with me right?? 
 Here it is. PL 
 I will bid $6 for Cary Blanchare, K Arizona and $3 for Gary Anderson K Minn PL 
 Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you.  Work has been real hectic. Trust me, I feel old as well.  The old body doesn't cooperate like it use to.  Jackson and Ashley are doing great.  We got our tree up and he just rounds around pointing at the glass balls on the tree and yelling balls!!!!  This christmas should be fun.  When are you coming out here to visit? PL 
 It was good to talk to you live.  I miss our chats, but this is the wrong time and place to discuss that.  Please do not fret at all about not asking me to stand up.  For what it is worth I didn't ask you either.  I think you are correct it would have been akward for both of us.  This week is a time when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that are pulling at you.  So you know, do not worry about us, we are there to celebrate with you and meet your family.  Take care of the other high maintenance people, because you will be suprised how many there are.  Try and relax and enjoy it.  I am looking forward to seeing you in that dress.  See you soon. PL 
 Congrats on the future addition.  We are all doing good.  Jackson is 20 months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for. PL 
 I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?  Since we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?  I know there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?  Wasn't really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45. Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon. PL 
 You finally win a game and you think your team rules...typical alabama fan. The scuddle butt I hear is that Jackie Sherrill will be you next coach...Did you play with him?  We will see if Auburn is for real this weekend. PL 
 I have even read where Ronney Daniels has said he does not mind having a reduced role as long as we win.  Hopefully the good times will continue.  I get all of those articles from that website  ww.tigeronline.com.  It is an outstanding website.  That article was from the Huntsville Times.  See you soon. PL 
 Hey goofball.  I sent this to you yesterday. PL 
 Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man     The ties that bind Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times 10/03/00 By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff   AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.  Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble, despair and losing.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --  More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- ''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. ''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.'' On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take.  A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about football. It was about matters of the heart.  ''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''  Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger.  It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi State.  Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times.  Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly under control, threatened his senior season.  ''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was crying.  ''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''  On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school.  ''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better.  ''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and understand what it's going to take for us to win.''  The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.  ''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''  It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.  They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.  No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when hardly anyone thought he could.  Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.  ''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this team are like brothers.''  Leard says nothing that happens can change that.  ''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.  ''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''  Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.  ''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger people but for all of us.'' 
 what room? PL 
 Good to hear from you as well.  Last I heard, you were running a dating service...What happened with that?  I have been at Enron for close to 3 years.  Ashley and I have a 18 month old son, Jackson.  Mom is doing good, as we all are.  How do you like Enron so far?  I absolutely love it.  I am in the Risk Management Group for Natural Gas Trading.  Dealing with the traders can be fun, but is usually quite challenging.  Unfortunately we have a lot of late nights waiting on systems - like we are right now.  What group are you with?  Where are you living these days?  We just built a house in PineBrook in Clear Lake.  We had our ten year reunion last weekend...quite strange.  I don't know if you know them, but several CL graduates work here.  Meredith Mitchell, Dawn Kenne, Mike Pyer.  Our curves just came out, so I am going to start calcing my P&L.  Talk to you later. PL 
 Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn Menear.  THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.  THe product type is US GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.  This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.  Robyn sets this curve everyday as a basis curve.  Thanks.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to shout. PL 
 Well, did you survive the week without your husband?  I am sure things are alot calmer now at home.  How is the little one?  Jackson is into everything.  Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and I hung out all day.  I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.  Ash was real proud. PL 
 done PL 
 There are four of us that are not playing tomorrow? PL 
 Are you the same Ashley Lord that went to Clear Lake High School.  I think I saw the Ashley Lord I went to high school with in the lobby and thought this might be you.  If not, please disregard my email.  Thanks. PL 
 Check this out.  Can't remember if I have sent this to you before. PL 
 Please provide me a list of deal numbers that need to be changed.  From you email I gather you are saying that all deals done by ENA with a Canadian Counterparty need to be ECC/3rd party and then flipped to ENA book/FT-US/Cand/ERMS.  Is this correct? PL 
 I have rugby practice on Tuesday's and Thursday's.  I can do it before work, long lunch or Monday/Friday.  Let me know. PL 
 I like it when you call me sailor. PL 
 Tell him it is firm.  We are obligating ourselves no matter what.  And tell him thank you again.  See you tonight pretty lady. PL 
 Per Bruce Mills - this goes through ENA PL 
 According to the trader, this is a gas daily daily for the balance of month. This may be a hedge for them for a physical deal, but it is financial from our perspective. PL 
 no thanks. PL 
 I will be there.  It is bid week, remind me. PL 
 I changed the first deal, the second one NZ3403, Kam got a call from credit that this should be with ECC.  We have a sheat from Bruce Mills that says all deals with Dynegy Canada should be through ECC. PL 
 Ask Why....Why doesn't the Ask Why commercials work? 
 sure.  Just give me a shout.  Next week will not be good and I would prefer if we could do it before 2 p.m.  Let me know. PL 
 sounds good.  We will have to start getting firm replies from people soon. Is the full amount still due on Feb. 15th?  If so, people will have to give us their money by then. PL

 Sorry I did not get back with you yesterday.  We have been really busy around here.  I called the person that I gave your resume to and she is on a business trip until early next week.  Her assistant is going to have her call me when she returns.  Apparently she left the day after I gave her the resume.  I will keep you informed.  If you look on our website www.enron.com and you see anything that interests you, let me know and I will put the resume in.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations file.  There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we flashed and what detail we now have.  We will have to take this adjustment to the P&L(wil be expense).  I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or LT Transport.  I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you each month by Cernosek's group.  For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed ($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).  The detail in this file plus these three numbers should tie out.  If not, please let me know. Shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help. PL 
 I bid $0 on New Orleans D 
 I bid $2 of Miami's D and $1 on Detroit's D 
 I passed it off today to someone in the Public Relations dept.  I will also look on our bulletin board and see what if anything is out there. PL 
 Done. PL 
 Cathy please seperate two items from your original list.  TAGG#N50101.C for $897,332 and TAGG#N70687.7 for $659,979.  These two liquidations relate to a NGPL storage deal on the desk that should have variances for several months. The net amount of these two liquidations is $237,353.  For now, please  put this item on the backpage on it's own line.  We will reconcile the other storage lines in the next few weeks and see what if anything needs to be added to this line.  At that time we will work out the necessary steps to get this item off of the backpage.  Scott is still looking at TAGG#N38268.L for $1,443,519 for the remainder of the balance for May.  Shout with any questions. PL 
 I like that. PL 
 Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical liquidations:   Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.  All three of these equalled the 3.7 million.  You should use the revised and the capacity hedge file.  When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).  This amount should be a "desk adjustment".  We have accounted for the variance in our current month (0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.  Please shout with any questions. PL

 Here is the email reminder of the curve setting process.  After you set your curves(do not hit finished file), go to the GD Pmgr tab and change the date in the left hand corner to two business days out(Friday set for Tuesday). Then go to the CurveFetch tab and place your file on automatic calc(can not hit F9).  Then hit fetch Prices button.  Prices should be brought in for current date.  Go to the AutoCurve tab and hit paste curves.  When this is done, hit finished file and the date will be updated so that I know your curves are ready to load in ERMS.  Please feel free to shout with any questions.  Thanks. PL 
 How about Eric Moulds and Kevin Faulk for Ed McCauffrey, Yancy Thigpen and Mike Cloud PL 
 Glad to hear your trip was wonderful.  Things are great hear.  We are anxiously awaiting the arrival of football season and our annual trips back to Auburn.  Where is Steve's new job?  Are you guys still planning on going to the Friday night party at Cadillac Bar.  I have to hurry and send in my money for the event.  Talk to you soon. PL 
 Give me a break...just like last year, I will finish ahead of you again. Mean machine will be PLove's bitch again this year. PL 
 what day? 
 Here is the file.  Thanks. PL 
 Please make the following changes for me please: No Vacation on Sept. 11 Change my late day from sept 12 to sept 19 schedule vacation on Sept. 18th.  Please call with any questions.  Thanks. PL 3-7376 
 Thanks Bill. PL 
 Here is the file. PL 
 I just wanted to respond to your email and let you know the thought process of the book move for Ontario.  This move was requested by the trader 10 days ago.  We notified Curtis Smith and Bill Kasemervisz the following business day last Monday - July 24th.  For future reference, please let us know exactly how much notice is required and if you think there are other groups we may have missed notifying so that this does not become a problem again. Thanks for your help. PL 
 FYI - please fix my name on you emails.  They say Phillippe Love.  Thanks. PL 
 Attached is the book request.  Could you please process as soon as possible. We are flipping Geoff Storey's book tonight to a us book(price and basis split out) and we will need an index book.  Sorry for the short notice, we were working with IT to get the conversion and just found out today that they did not set up a new index book.  Thanks for your help, and call with any questions. PL 3-7376 
 Attached is the file that I use from Storey to load his curves.  It has quite a few tabs because he uses the model to track his positions and P&L.  The tabs that should be of interest to you are the upload tab - for the curve names and the batch tab for the curve prices.  Please give me a shout with any questions. PL 3-7376 
 Kam asked that I email you guys about the FT-ONTARIO book move.  Please move the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.  This also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in the curve table.  This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.  Thanks for you help and please shout with any questions. PL 
 Please take both of these amounts and add them to the synthetic storage variance section in Economics.  I have added them to my spreadsheet that I am compiling.  Thanks. PL 
 This deal is booked correctly.  The external fee, labeled exchange fee is the .145 cents per mm that we owe them for the exchange.  The confirmation letter is wrong.  The fee per Geoff Storey the trader is .145.  This is also known as a spread fee.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call 3-7376. PL 
 Looks like these are released status now.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. PL 
 Asa & Joy,  I just wanted to take a minute and thank the two of you for your generosity this past week.  My friends and I had a terrific time and everyone really enjoyed your condo.  The weather was terrific and the fish put up a formidable challenge.  We are very interested in renting the condo from you guys during the season this year.  I requested that the cleaning charges this time be put on my credit card.  Please let me know if  they charge you guys anything.  Thanks again.  We look forward to seeing you guys soon. Phillip 
 Spoke with Sheetal and she had a similar question.  We are putting our deals in TDS.  We do not have paper tickets.  I understand there is a meeting scheduled for the end of the week to discuss this issue. PL 
 Nice pic. I don't know if I would let him put his arm around my wife. PL 
 Sorry man, I am swamped today.  Doing my book and Trey's and I have a 6 p.m. flight to Utah.  I will try and get back with you today.  The offer will definitely have to get sweeter to get the 2 pick overall. PL 
 Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday and the farwell deal.  Please review and let me know if you agree with this. If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet amounts.  We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange being included in this model.  For the foreign exchange,  I took an average exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.  Thanks. PL 
 I just added the swaps to these deals.  Sorry about that.  Thanks for letting me know. PL 
 Drew Bledsoe - $31 Panthers D - $6 49ers D - $3 Seahawks D - $3 PL 
 I wanted to let you guys know that I changed the files.  I had one deal with FT Central that was in the physical file that was financial.  I transferred the deal to Sheetal's file.  I also added the sitara numbers to the physical file.  Sorry for the mishaps. PL 
 I am game on both accounts. PL 
 Here is the revised model.  Let me know what you think. PL 
 I think we can handle going with 7 if everyone will be there.  Make sure those Texas boys commit to playing and will come back and calc like the rest of us. PL 
 yes 
 Here is the file.  We used Victor's transport model that he uses for all of the other transport deals.  The omicron volatility curve that we used was 11 - the same as other Chigate deals.  Give me a shout with any questions. PL 
 so it last week, pretty funny.  It looks like an actual commercial.  How are things going with you?  Good I hope.  When am I going to get an invite to the new pad? PL 
 here is the WACOG Delma.  Cathy could you add her to the email.  Thanks. PL 
 Matt Stover, K Bal - $26 
 I am for the normal draft - same as last year. PL 
 I am game for anything late in the day. PL 
 Please take my name off of your emails, I am no longer in the OA group. Please add me to the Ontario email - I am doing risk for that desk.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI 
 8/20

 First I have heard about a happy hour.  I am in risk management and am usually not finished calcing my books til 7 p.m.   I will most likely not make it.  Thanks for the invite. PL 
 I will be off on Friday. Thanks for the invite. PL

 I hand delivered the resume's to Brenda and Mike. PL 
 I apologize.  The deal confirmation group down here instructed me to book these deals this way.  I am in the process of rebooking these deals as we speak.  They will be fixed within the hour. PL 
 Can you unarchive a postid for me.  The number is 773500.  Thanks. PL 
 I agree with Bryan.  Judging by the number of email's he is sending, it looks like he doesn't have enough work over there.  I am sure the Texas boys could use his help on calcing the books.  I will try and limit my smack talking next week and I think someone else needs to jam Mick's finger before next week's game, it seemed to help him free throw shooting last night. PL 
 hey fool, why don't you let me send it and get paid - I will cut you a slice.  Moscoso does the DPR, he does not do risk. PL

 FYI - I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and booked to GD - Central.  This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were incurred related to this orig.

 Hey what time were you meeting us up at Jock's and Jill's tomorrow?  Your brother said you won't be in till around 3 p.m.  You need to get there earlier than that if I am going to buy you a beer. PL

Successfully monitored and managed the deferral accounts for several major customers on the Texas desk   Sorry this is a few days late, I hope I did not forget anything. PL

 Attached is the file with the appropriate liquidations that should match the transport expense variance.  We are within a few thousands dollars of the variance using these calculated liquidation amounts.  They are all physical annuities in the FT-Ont-Central book.  I am getting the post ids unarchived to verify that they were in the flash financial liquidations.  Please tell me if you have these in the FT file, I have already checked Jim's intra physical and financial files for Ontario and came up empty.  My thinking(hoping) on this issue is that  the liquidations will be flashed and not captured in the GL.  Give me a shout with any questions. PL 
 Can you unarchive the following post ids for me please: 684492 703886 725784  Thanks for you help PL

 How are things in Denver?  I haven't heard from you in a while and I thought I would drop you a line.  I have the picture of all of us from that mexican food restaurant off of Westheimer under my mouse pad and I was thinking about you.  How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new living situation?  It can be tough at first, but as long as you are patient, everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible. They blew another 7 run lead last night.  At least the stadium is really nice, otherwise I would be very dissappointed that I got tickets.  I hope your parents are still enjoying the seats.  Talk to you soon. PL

 The price is $5.40 canadian dollars as referenced on TAGG #NI7771.2.  Due to TAGG constraints, the deal had to be booked as two legs in tagg to capture the canadian price.  I left Bob a message last week and again today that teh Utilicorp price is right in sitara and tagg, the confirm should have gone out at IF Ventura + .1825.  My understanding from the conversation with Bob was that the confirm had not gone out yet, however, the trader got a phone call today that the deal got confirmed at the wrong price.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. PL 
 Please see attached file.  Look at your color on the recon var tab. PL

Are your parents still in Auburn?  How about your lovely sister?  I bet she is married with several children.  We go back to Auburn every football season for about three games, if you are ever in town, we will have to get together.  Clear Lake is having our ten year reunion this fall.  Should be fun.

 All of these deals had their facilities changed by logistics on the last two days.  I have reiterated to Lisa Kinsey the importance of her group letting us know when they make a change in facility.  All of these were physical basis trades, so they came at contract - the desk price difference is not more than .04 on any of the deals.  OA therefore should be minimal. PL 
 Please put a posting out there for me as well.  Thanks. PL

 Glenda, Hope everything is going well for you guys.  I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for the easter  gift you sent Jackson.  It was very thoughtful.

We are headed to Jazz fest this weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.  Take care and we will talk to you soon.  Thanks again. Love, Jackson, Ashley & Phillip

 here it is. PL 
 My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.  I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes. PL 
 I still have two tickets.  Let me know soon. PL 
 what about some "treatments" at one of those spas?  or dinner for two at ruggles? PL

 I wanted to ask a favor.  Would you mind reminding your group to please let us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal in sitara.  If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically update when you change the physical deal.  If the change is simply a meter, that will not effect the pricing of the deal.  Thanks for your help. PL

 not sure if you guys saw this. PL  Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy The Associated Press 3/18/2001 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was essentially fired. "Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract," Muse said. More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. "That's how David and I worked," Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his Orlando home. "We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be enough (to save his job)." Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until "the wee hours of the morning," then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and "urged him to stay until the end of the season." Muse said that was "the most celebrated case" of Lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions, but "there are many others." Bowden often commented that "Mr. Lowder hired me" and that the coach had "regular contact" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke with Lowder "weekly, if not daily" during his first two or three seasons, but "never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I should do it." Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 1993. "Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me hired," said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. "There's no doubt about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn." Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling the strings on that decision. Bowden "always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of Lowder's influence," Muse said. "So he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship." Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff Ellis has "very, very frequent contact" with the Montgomery banker. Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide "support and input" to the president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive accomplishments and "stop bickering." 
 We will have a group class on OA tomorrow around 9:00 am in EB3268.  THis is an effort to get you guys up to speed on OA so you can review forms and I can take 3 hour lunches.  See you there. PL 
 I am looking at having a party at my house for the group.  Let me know asap which date is better for you guys.  I want to do it asap before it gets to hot, so we can cook outside.  Here are the two dates I have in mind Sat. May 5th(cinco de mayo) or Sat. May 19th.  Let me know guys.  Thanks. PL 
 FYI - wanted to let you guys know about a few things: 1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep from having more than 3 people out at a time. 2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful. These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances. 3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct gd curve. 4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the process and how to prepare forms. 5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for career development. 6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your training plans.  Please shout with any questions. PL

 FYI - not sure if anyone ahs been putting vacation time in on a time sheet. I got a report and most everyone's was blank.  If you believe this to be an error, see me and I will show you the list.  I am not calling anyone out for cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.  I draw your attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to carry over 40 hrs.  Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.  I have attached the site for your time sheets.  You will need your P# and password to access, contact security if you do not have either.  If you need help filling this out, let me know.  I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.  Thanks.  https://ehronline.enron.com/ PL

 The tagg number for the january piece is QP7914.  This deal was put in after the fact - Feb.  so, we will have a variance in January that should be offset in February.  This is due to the information not getting to us in time to change the customer price in Sitara before we flashed Jan.  The sitara number that this all relates to is 543246.  Sh
