 congrats.  that is good news.  what else is going on. 
 did you like the blond with the white sweater? 
 shawn is in town tonight and wants to get a bite to eat if you are up for it. 
 i will let you know.  i need to run after work. 
 email me back or just give me a call tonight. 
 what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was dc?  i heard that place is a blast. 
 ok.  i will take it. 
 are you guys using all your tickets?  i can buy one today if you guys are using yours.  probably a good idea for me to buy it anyway.  i think that i am going in sat morning. 
 yeah bra 
 i got a ticket.  fucking girlfriends.  girls hate football. 
 you're already in love. 
 are your boys ready to get rolled sat. night? 
 are you going in town for the lsu game this weekend? 
 i heard dc is fun.  i don't care what we do.  we were talking about going to boone's sat and hang out on his porch and drink before we go out.  i think he has a patio in his backyard. 
 greatest email ever 
 we are going in saturday.  thanksgiving was great.  i played golf all weekend.  how was yours.  i really appreciate you sending that resume on.  did you get this reply earlier?  my cpu keeps blowing up. 
 what is it.  i got to know.  i need some new chicks.  i need the weekend.  today totally sucks.  what are some good books to read? 
 no, but i saw that they won tonight.  it was close.  is sakic going to be ok? 
 i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next morning when you both woke up. 
 ditto.  work is it.  i am going to vegas this weekend, so i got that going for me. 
 i bought my ticket.  i arrive on that saturday @ 12:20pm.  i will email grandma. 
 hey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  love matt 
 what is grandma's email address? 
 i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.  love matt 
 i hope this isn't a pic of a naked old man again.  what has been going on?  i haven't heard from you in a while. 
 you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something this week. 
 did they look good or lucky to win?  how is roy playing? 
 you said the line worked well and when i first started reading that i was like "hey now!".  you never know.  you could be a wild woman on vacation if you never have to see those people again. 
 why would you shoot yourself?  chicks go home with guys all the time. 
 that is good 
 why not?  you don't like those things?  you get penis straws and everything. 
 how was your wedding? 
 i went to val's wedding.  it was a blast.  how did a wedding get busted by the cops?  what type of people went to this thing? 
 next week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to waste a saturday moving. 
 this is still my email.  what is going on?  how is your business doing? 
 i think i met a few of your friends that night, but i don't remember who is who.  it seems like such a long time ago. any time is good for me next week.  let's get together on tuesday?  let me know if that is good for you. 
 nice.  i knew that would be a better choice.  saturday night is on dog.  we are going to golf sat also if you are in.  let me know.  tee time is at 11. 
 745 sucks.  we will hit it sat night. 
 that was a mistake.  i don't know what i was thinking.  i need to stay home. 
 i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will try to call you and grandma this weekend.  matt 
 i am going with work.  another boondoggle. 
 he went home already.  we went to dinner mon & tues.  i am just going to chill this week and party on saturday, maybe even friday a little.  are you going out tomorrow? 
 enron would probably do something like this, but i think you need to contact that charity group.  they might already have a team.  it is good to see that you are such a philanthropist. 
 you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee? 
 i have a tee time for sat @ 11.  let me know if you think you can play today.  the course is sienna plantation. 
 saturday is definately on.  fri i am up for whatever.  maybe happy hour and turn in before 2am for once. 
 Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect New Orleans Saints team. The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.  He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.  Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one corner of the screen, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away --ka-boom!  "I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans and teaches him the great game of football, and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.  The young Bosnian is "canonized" as the Great Hero of football, and when Haslett asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl." "I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says. "You deserted us.  You are not my son." "I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads. "I just won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No, let me tell you," the mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday, and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight." The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says " ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to New Orleans."

 he is a winner.  kansas might turn into a 6 win a year program with cooper there. 
 yeah.  i think they will go to the rose bowl. 
 i am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned good time.  it is a good stress relief. 
 the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot. 
 rohan davey 
 you better be able to golf tomorrow. 
 you obviously haven't seen my new swing.  you need to be on your best game to take my title. 
 totally 
 nope 
 i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 2 hours 
 all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at front porch also SUSAN! 
 especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter 
  susan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.   susan said: why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself. 
 i am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room. 
 what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say " i am a trader at enron" 
 i think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night.  we will know for next weekend. 
 what is up with the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again? 
 how was moving this weekend?  did you still want to get a drink after work tomorrow? 
 this is their last hope 
 how was happy hour?  i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the message until late. 
 if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team 
 they have to be worried about you in ebs if you come in to work hung over on mondays 
 it is a good work out for you to move up 3 flights of stairs.  did you move it all yourself or pay someone to do it?   mi luna is good for me tomorrow.  i love their ritas.  how about we go around 7.  i can pick you up or just meet you there if you are going straight from work. 
 just b/c i am saving myself doesn't mean you need to attack me. 
 6:30 is fine with me.  i will meet you at the bar. 
 have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet?   i heard the comfort suites is where everyone is staying.  let me know if you guys just want to load everyone up in one room like back in high school. 
 comfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself. 
 i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store around the corner from my house. 
 that actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7.  that is the place in the village correct? 
 i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon" 
 i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each.  jen knows the details, but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week. 
 7:30 is good. 
 let me know what is up after you speak with her 
 did you call my cell last night? 
 he is a mo 
 i don't have it, but shoot him an email and he will give you a call. 
 i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites.  it would be $200/each for the whole week if 4 were in a room.  a condo would most likely be more expensive. 
 jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party. 
 we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.16. 
 hell yeah dog!  they betta be ready to get up on deez nuts. 
 did you take his v-card?  i don't think i ever dated one.  i like my women fast. 
 oy vey 
 i was going to talk about all the dope he used to do and how he used to wear make up in middle school.

 thanks for the thank you note  asshole 
 i heard there are a lot of hot cougars at changs 
 remember that shirley sent this to me.  it is funny but gross. 
 how was hawaii dog?  did you leave the room? 
 are you guys going to send something special?  how about some stripper's pa= nties from the bachelor party?  any news on caymen rooms? 
 why are you staying with her parents?  won't that kill some of your fun?  how good was the deal? 
 you partied it up at jazz fest?  i still have never been.  who did you go there with? 
 yeah i will be in town this weekend.  i have something to go to fri but i will definately be out on saturday.  what are you doing? 
 i think she is one of jen's cougar friends.  that is such a chick thing to do. 
 read the bottom of the email with some chicks idea as a gift 
 i am sure that girl courtney walker would like to share some special memories also 
 sure.  you buy something and let me know how much i owe 
 so i got us a hotel room in caymen.  it can sleep up to six and it is $880 for the three nights.  if all 5 of us stay there that is 176/ea.  we have it for thurs-sat night. 
 jen's dad better buy a bunch of booze.  and the schrutt's better take us somewhere nice for the rehersal dinner.  and jen's friends better put out. 
 what is the date of the party 
 i tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look?  st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time. 
 oh yeah.  he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.  what are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?  if you need entertainment i might be for hire.  i would totally give those chicks a thrill. 
 what  time is golf for? 
 does anyone have a picture of max when he used to walk around and flex his pecs? 
 i will be there 
 that does sound gay 
 season over 
 i am ready to take some more of your money out there 
 he is there best player 
 oops 
 if i could get a guaranteed contract plus tips i would skip the trip.  remember how great my legs would look dancing all over the chicks. 
 i have to go to a dinner tonight, but i will meet up with you guys at the grasshopper if you want.  we need to check that joint out.  call me on my cell and we will hit it. 
 didn't you go to grasshopper last night 
 was it any good 
 let's meet up at grasshopper 
 i thought that you said you were sharing a suite with them.  thanks for the pics. 
 i would but i am going to the spa 
 whatever gillette.  i will be feeling all loose and relaxed while i am whooping it up at the grasshopper tonight. 
 everyone who is anyone will be there. 
 i will be the prettiest at the grasshopper 
 meeting up with boone and luis and whoever.  if the broker goes we will just get some free drinks.  date went well.  i had a good time. 
 did you just get that reply? 
 are you going out this weekend?  i think you said you had a wedding to go to or something?     were you hurting on wednes morning? 
 i thought that you were going 
 yeah baby!   that place is gonna rock 
 i don't know.  i am going to golf sunday morning at the woodlands which is very nice.  i don't want to be real hung over, but i still might go out.  tonight i am definately going out. 
 i felt fine.  i woke up at 5am to work out.  i guess you are just a candy ass.  just kidding.  i have a dinner to go to tonight with some broker then i am heading downtown.  i will give you a call this weekend.  have fun at the wedding. 
 i tried to call yesterday, but you guys were not home.  i did speak with grandma and grandpa.  grandpa sounded really bad.  i am a little worried after speaking with him.  he sounded to tired to even speak.  i think i need to get out to phoenix to see them soon. 
 give me a call from dc when you get a chance.  love matt 
 i felt like a champ on sat 
 i didn't do all those shots with boone 
 Derek-  Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
 we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
 did you call for me at work today? 
 did you call me today at work 
 how was your wedding on saturday? 
 i can't remember if i sent these to you guys or not    >"You Were an Accident!" > > > > > >"Strangers Have the Best Candy" > > > > > >"The Little Sissy Who Snitched" > > > > > >"Some Kittens Can Fly!" > > > > > >"Getting More Chocolate on Your Face" > > > > > >"Where Would You Like to Be Buried?" > > > > > >"Kathy Was So Bad Her Mom Stopped Loving Her" > > > > > >"The Attention Deficit Disorder Association's Book of Wild Animals of > > >North Amer...

 i wasn't that drunk on saturday.  i was just joking.  i felt great on saturday.  like a champ.  people get married younger than you?  wow.  what the hell do they do if they get married that early? 
 i had to wake up early on sunday so i didnt feel like going.  were there a lot of hotties? 
 i will be here on fri night, but sat i am going to tim's engagement party.  i think i will be out on fri. 
 i am here dog 
 yeah, paincourtville, la.  i don't know where the fuck that is. 
 i will be watching.  have fun 
 test 
 when are you riding into baton rouge?  sat or fri? 
 1400 smith st. houston, tx 77002-7361 
 did chad hit you up to live with him? 
 if you leave on sat i will ride with you guys 
 i thought that was your area code.  kind of freaked me out.  you can be a little crazy sometimes.  just kidding.  don't mess with texas is good.  it is about to get really hot here.  we reserved a room at comfort suites.  i think that is where everyone is staying in the caymens?  i am looking foward to it.  should be a blast.  when is the bachelorette party?  what are you guys going to do? 
 i just looked at the prices for flights to cayman and they run around $600.  this is going to cost over $1000.  start saving now. 
 i knew you would bag me again!  if you have to work there is nothing you can do about that.  i am going to baton rouge on saturday for an engagement party.  i will probably go out on friday.  when do you get back from chicago?  give me a call and maybe we can do something next week. 
 i heard they might move the wedding to miami 
 i am up for it.  should be a good weekend to live it up. 
 memorial weekend = booze + golf + sluts 
 i think miami would be more fun than cayman.  cayman is really laid back.  miami = hot sluts 
 i don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said.  i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not.  don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it.  i think miami would be a lot more fun. 
 she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each.    miami will rock. 
 does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either place will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life. 
 i just want to meet some models down there.  i don't hang out at discos thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.  i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis. 
 i think i will wear a suit with a t-shirt like sonny crocket 
 merlin can be captain castillo 
 mini me 
 or the peck from the movie willow 
 are you and celeste going to br on fri or sat 
 nice 
 "how they met" brought tears to my eyes 
 does this have nudity? 
 what time do you want to leave tomorrow?  around noon? 
 TOTALLY 
 i have to hold off until vegas.  my liver is sore from this past weekend.  i have to go home and nurse it at night. 
 this weekend i had to go to baton rouge for an engagement party.  i am going to stay in town this weekend.  i might try to go tubing or something like that.  what did you do this weekend?  are you in town for memorial day? 
 i am not dating her.  i only went out with her a few times.  i doubt we will go out again.  how about you?  have you been dating a lot lately? 
 sure.  we can probably get out there and play at 3. 
 do you think the avs will close out the blues tonight?  they haven't looked too good the last two games. 
 i am not that picky.  she is nice it just didn't work out well.  we had fun  it just hasnt took off.  one of those deals. 
 is it still snowing? 
 what did you do this weekend?  i gave you a shout on fri to go out.  you didn't miss much.  we went to the grasshopper and that joint sucks.  it is really cheesy. 
 shooters.

 let me check with him and see what night would be good for him to go up.  we are golfing on fri so sat might be a better time to get up there.  i will let you know. 
 did you get chad's email?  i would rather go up next weekend.  i will go up this weekend if you are up for it, but if not i think we need a good excuse. 
 did you see the article in the journal where cali's attorney general said he wants to lock up ken lay (ene's chairman) in a prison cell with a cell mate? 
 next sat might be better.  i don't think mitch is gonna be able to make it and everyone was out of town last weekend.  let's do it next sat if you are in town. 
 i told him i didn't think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat. 
 call me again when you get a chance.  i lost your number 
 you think this weekend will be more packed than next?    let's just do it next weekend.  that way mitch and i can both head in.  tim might be able to make it then also. 
 what does that mean? 
 we might have a cook out or something on sat.  if that is the case i will let you know. 
 no thanks.  what aabout the happy hour with the hottie? 
 for easter i just stayed in town and golfed all weekend?  what did you do?  did you go to central and regulate some punks.  what are you doing this weekend?  i am going to vegas.  i haven't been home at all this month except for last weekend.  i have to go to buttfuck mississippi next weekend for a wedding. 
 i think chad is pissed we aren't going to austin.  he sent me a message that said " u snooze u lose".  what the fuck is that? 
 i said i would go next weekend. 
 yeah.  i couldn't get an opp to  talk to her. did you know her 
 the product number for pg&e topock is 47085.   the correct company name for transcanada is the division of transcanada.  thanks for your help.  matt 
 yep.  i was going to try and talk to her but she was reading and listening to a walkman.  i was sweating like a freak when i was running.  probably scared her.  it looked like i was evaporating. 
 i'm bout it 
 luis - you love heating oil 
 nevermind.  so why didn't you think that girl was the type i go for last night?  how was the game? 
 do you like the avs chances?  i think it should be an awesome series. 
 the sitara deal looks correct 
 val is getting married there.  his fiance, celeste, is from there.  mississippi is so cool. 
 i think i have montezuma's revenge 
 i have a type and she fits it.  you obviously didn't know who she was.  so is your boss going to make you take out her son? 
 she looks like she fits it 
 how is your face doing?  is the swelling going down? 
 memorial all packed up.  we can go out there and just try to get on.  hopefully around 2:30.  maybe you can get out early and get our names on. 
 you up for golf tomorrow 
 me you and val tomorrow 
 it is on espn so that won't work.  if i was you i just wouldn't go.  just hit the dinner. 
 whatever.  ride would be good. 
 i got your jacket from bass 
 i am going to hell for that one 
 yeah i know, but admit you laughed. 
 do you want to send your resume to enron again?  they are on a big kick to hire some new people.  might be worth your while just to take a look and  see how it compares. 
 i got your message but i need to work 
 my bad man.  i got your message around 930 and i went to bed after that.  let's hook up with them this weekend.  what is up for tonight?  i say we hit club no minor on sat and then uropa.  we need to tear it up some. 
 i am up for a few drinks tonight.  maybe lz's or something laid back.  i want to feel like a champ tomorrow. 
 do you guys want to hit el patio early on saturday and get some blue ritas and then head over to uropa?  that would be a good night to go tear it up completely. 
 means you got a lot of ammo 
 i booked my flight home on june 30th.  i arrive that afternoon and leave to houston on the 7th.  so have the frig packed with food and beer and be ready to golf.  looking foward to getting home.  love matt 
 lets definately play tomorrow. 
 call me later.  let's get some drinks some where laid back and try to meet some honeys.  let's go to lz or something. 
 i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night? 
 i will invite you to be my caddie.  you can carry my clubs and clean them for me.  if you do a good job i will give you a crisp $5 bill. 
 i guess i am going up there saturday.  i think i will try to take it easy on friday.  i can  definately tell that i am not 18 anymore b/c i cannot recover at all. i am also going broke going out. 
 so what did you and lisa do until 7am loverboy? 
 send your resume and i will get it to the right people. 
 nintendo doesn't count for your handicap.  how about the avs.  that was the most impressive game they have played all post season. 
 nevermind 
 sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon. 
 i think that is a scam to have you send it around 
 i remember you.  i was pretty drunk though.  hopefully i didn't make too much of an ass out of myself.  we hit it really hard that night for my buddy's birthday.  how was your bachelorette party?  are you back in austin now? 
 who sings that song "harley davidson of a bitch"?  i think you said it was elo or something. 
 i am excited to watch it.  so you got a promotion at work?  that is good news.  what is your new job going to be? 
 my friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street. 
 lets head up to austin on saturday night.  i got an email from that girl at the black swan.  she lives in austin but will be at a wedding on sat. 
 i will be in nd.  i think my plane lands 10 min. after yours.  avs got worked last night.  i don't have a good feeling about the series now.  they had no answer for the defense. 
 i think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on.  i need the  range.  just send your resume when you get a chance.  enron is looking for a ton of people. 
 i haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play? 
 i just don't know if they can ever handle that defense.  they didn't make any good adjustments in the 3rd period. 
 i forgot you had a wedding.  i don't go up to austin all that much.  i usually stay down here and go out.  where do you work up there again?  i am sure you told me, but i forgot.  where are the good places to hang out?  is it 4th st? 
 you think houston is the armpit of the world?  i love it hear.  the weather sucks in the summer, but other than that it is a blast.  so you do work for strip clubs huh?  that is interesting.  what is your stripper name? 
 i live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf.  outside of the loop is pretty ugly.  which part of houston did you grow up in? 
 i think hoskina is having a going away happy hour, but after that i am not doing anything.  i need to watch hockey. 
 your mama 
 prompt month is out there.  it is nwpl rox. 
 i went to high school in denver.  i have only lived here for 2 years.  no wonder you hate houston.  there is nothing up in north houston. 
 i went to denver east.  have you heard of it?  i haven't heard of your friends that work here.  i like working here.  it is pretty exciting on the trading floor.  are you guys going out tomorrow night after the rehersal dinner. 
 i don't remember the bet 
 i will be in town.  i have a dinner to go to at 6:30, but i am going out after that.  you should give me a call.  i think you have my cell phone number right? 
 this is correct. 
 i don't get it 
 austin tomorrow.  you in 
 i guess it didn't come through 
 this girl has clothes on 
 i am going to a broker dinner at capitol grill.  i am going to head out afterwards.  i will give you a call later. 
 you should just put 5000 on the lakers.  you wont make 5k but you will definately make $$$ 
 are you hurting this morning?  my lifestyle has to change within the next 5 years or i will be dead. 
 i arrive in fargo  at 12:20 from minneapolis on flight 1051. see you soon. 
 Stephanie-  I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it.  Thank you,  Matt Lenhart 
 oh it is going great.  so great to hear from you.  how is everything at the top of the building? 
 i know that when you get really mad at me it is only b/c you care..................so......................much 
 yeah.  i sent it in this morning. 
 what is going on?  so is the wedding in miami now?  do i need to buy some club clothes for south beach? 
 Astra Power also needs to be added to this product 
 i will send it to the right people today 
 i need to call that girl tonight.  you have got to give them a few days before you call.  i wanted to take her out thurs but the stanley cup is on.  maybe fri is better.  take your girl out then and we can meet up later for drinks. 
 thank you for your help 
 i feel like a champ today 
 i will let you know tomorrow.  i leave sat morning so fri would be perfect.  i think six days is kind of trendy so i am going 4 days. 
  this is that invite.  are you going to hit this tomorrow?  i will stop by. 
 i am with ya dog 
 i will be pissed if i can walk out of this party 
 i am definately bringing back some talent to the stabbin cabin 
 i am gonna drink like a kennedy 
 have you heard back from enron? 
 what do you think of the avs chances tonight?  don't forget your clubs. 
 i will let you out of the bet for $20 
 i am gonna drink like boone 
 your past few months have been just as bad.  at least i didn't close uropa b/c i was puking in the bathroom. 
 let's definately go next thurs.  i didn't hit it either b/c the hockey game was on.  did you get a date for tonight?  i am going out with one of those p.t.s.  let me know and maybe we can meet up. 
 i should have given you some cards to pass out to the hotties. 
 i thought you said you were gonna get that clam back to the stabbin cabin 
 no it is nice.  i shouldn't have any problems. 
 how was the weekend?  did i miss anything on saturday night for halloween? 
 give me a call 
 mack brown lost in austin to north carolina st. 
 famous vassigh quotes:  "pass the butter" "you gonna finish that?" "if loving this cake is wrong, i don't want to be right" "i can eat twice as much of this ice cream b/c it is fat free" "food in lousyana is overrated.  texas food rules" "texas biscuts rule the world" "i like my cookies texas size" "don't mess with texas banana splits" 
 i did watch a lot yesterday, but i was tired and slept most of the time. 
 i thought we would win.  they suck.  i hate football. 
 the law student was the replacement b/c the real one was such a fuck up.  sorry i didn't call you guys back last  night.  i didn't get home until 8 and the sopranos was on. 
 i don't remember half of that night, but i do remember you in the bathroom.  sierra is fun on wednesdays isn't it? 
 everyone was pissed cause we lost.  what did you do this weekend? 
 it was ok.  we went to the lsu game and lsu lost so we came home that night.  what did you do this weekend? 
 just messing with you. 
 i am not fighting with you at all.  you are just grilling me.  you are an angry person. 
 i was sober and i remember how it went down.  i said one rude thing in the car and that was it.  you were just going nuts and wouldn't let it die.  you kept flipping out on me. 
 only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you wouldn't let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just venting frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober. 
 you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who said you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.  you were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours. 
 i was being nice.  you kept starting it and then blaming it on me.  you were going nuts. 
 you were letting me have it.  i deserved some of it b/c i made some bad jokes, but overall you were pretty brutal.  i think i am heading to baton rouge for the game this weekend instead of partying for halloween. 
 you still mad at me?  you were pissed last night. 
 by the way, my abs kill from my rigorous workout yesterday. 
 call me.  i cant find your number through the operator. 
 i think i am going to go to the game. 
 actually they are not looking at us.  some of our lawyers defended revlon.  i heard it wrong. 
 i dont know but we would be the prettiest in the industry. 
 sorry i had to run last night.  so the word is now that enron has about 4 or 5 companies looking to take us over.  aol, lucent, revlon?, and a few others.  i will give you a call later. 
 who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls. 
 read this article.  it is a little dramatic. 
 i think we are now going to r&r.  boone has free passes. 
 i heard saturday, but that looks like it is the following sat.  that would work out perfect.  i am ready to tear it up. 
 who is better for the avs to play?  what has been going on in denver? 
 i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it.  what is xp? 
  this is the group throwing the party at r&r sat night.  check some of the photos at the link at the bottom.  lots of hotties. 
 i think i am going to dress up as a chippendale stripper.  i am going to oil myself up and go out in a thong. 
 i doubt it.  i want to go party afterwards and dress up for halloween.  are you going as gi joe again? 
 no.  it means i am excited to go. 
 i am gonna get wasted at this dinner. 
 i think we might go to the garden in the heights party or r&r for halloween.  we are going to watch the game first.  let me know if you hear of anything else. 
 so are we still on for dinner or what? 
 ok.  what are you guys doing for halloween?  boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r.  i guess there is some halloween thing there.  let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later. 
 i was going to go running after work and then maybe stop by.  who all was going to go? 
 should be 7.20. 
 give me a shout later.  we need to dress up and party regardless. 
 b/c i want you to understand when i am out of money, but if you owe me dinner and are out of money i cant understand. 
 there is a double standard here so i can't understand 
 you guys still going out tonight? 
 probably not.  i think you should understand my situation. 
 yeah.  i had it picked out and everything.  i had to call the dealer and tell him i am not going to suprise you with it.  we can still go to dinner tomorrow night though. 
 i like miss +10.5, iowa st, and ark 
 our stock is taking a bath. 
 my 401k is now worthless.  i have no money. 
 i definately need to throw in some shit about that and all the stripper  sluts we met in vegas.  or the hooker scott hooked up with.  that would make a good speech. 
 thanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed. 
 those brides maids are ready to party.  this hotel is right on south beach. 
 i have a room reserved.  it is $160/night.  we can split it up and pay $40 each which is cheap.  i think it is around jan 12th.  i have the room from that thurs-sat. 
 i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip? 
 enron is going to be a penny stock pretty soon.  sec is investigating now. 
 sorry i didn't get back to you last night.  i will find out who is in town.  i talked to some people and they are up for it.  we could watch lsu and then go to r&r.  they are having a pimps and prostitute party. 
 i sent it today so you should get it by thurs. 
 are you going to do  your halloween party or what?  i will start telling jill and her friends.  i think you should do it.  i will help you out with everything on it. 
 i got them.  i left you a voice mail last night.  send me your address and i will mail them today. 
 i hate notre dame.  tim, i need to get down to your office today. 
 the wedding was fun.  drank a lot during the day and i was worn out sat night after the game.  i am staying here this weekend. 
 i did. 
 let me know.  i will be up for some drinks. 
 i went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.  sorry about taking off like that.  i had a good time, but i ran out of energy quick. 
 this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10. 
 definately.  let me know. 
 should have taken the bet and given the points.  i didn't hear from you when i offered that. 
 how was this weekend?  did you get into anything? 
 i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time.  do you want to golf sat? 
 maybe i will come home the 16th of may.  let me see and i will get back to you. 
 i am definately staying in town.  i don't feel like battling that traffic. 
 i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.  we watched it and then went out in the french quarter.  i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows.  i don't think i want to drive in for the game. 
 you wish that was your problem 
 thurs night was ok.  we went to taco milagro.  that place is full of old folks now.  how was the weekend? 
 did you end up going out last night? 
 means i could be tired afterwards. 
 i might.  i need to go running or something. 
 yeah.  she is cute.  i heard she was divorced but i wasn't sure.  little young to be divorced. 
 you partying tonight? 
 she is nice.  i don't think it will lead to much.  do you know that girl paige? 
 i can't come the last week b/c of work.  that is when prices get set for next month gas.  it is a very busy week and there is no way for me to get out of it.  when are grandma and grandpa coming? 
 it was good.  had some good meetings and stuff like that.  didn't party or anything. 
 what is up?  this weekend i am going to n.o. for a wedding.  what are you up to?  did you have fun on sat?  i had a good time.  are you going out tonight?  i think we might hit up milagro. 
 lets go around 9.  i think hull is in also. 
 great.  good to hear.  i got back last night. 
 did you see the article in the wsj today on that ljm fund associated with ene? 
 who is up for milagro or something tonight? 
 did you miss me while i was gone? 
 he was just trying to run up our p/e.  some of the things these guys did was fradulent. 
 sorry i haven't called you back.  i am in portland.  i don't get back until tonight.  i will call you when i get home.  hope all is well. 
 i thought i won the tie breaker.  what happened? 
 are you on crutches 
 try his email address which is pederliefkjeseth@hotmail.com.  that is the only way i know how to get in touch with him.  i haven't booked a flight yet but i will soon. 
 i will do that. 
 not jerk, "the king" 
 the king doesn't just give gifts for no reason. 
 that is how i want you to refer to me as "the king" 
 i'm the king 
 i would have to regulate 
 you can't be cheap if you take me out.  i won't stand for it. 
 i was thinking somewhere that requires a jacket, like tony's.  someplace that is like $30 an entree. 
 i don't understand that last email 
 we can go somewhere nice.  real nice. 
 i am not letting you out of this 
 oh.  my bad.  i must have had you messed up with some other girl i made the bet with. 
 the blonde did have a hot body.  she doesn't have as pretty of a face.  tough loss last night. 
 colorado beat texas a&m.  i know you remember the bet. 
 tamu lost by 10. 
 no.  i got her number though.  i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket.  what happened to you?  i had a blast that night. 
 no i am not lying.  i flew here last night. 
 i am out of town.  i am in portland.  you can buy me dinner when we get back. 
 go florida!  they shit their pants this weekend. 
 i will be in vegas.  send her my regards. 
 i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope that helps you out. 
 watched lsu and then went to r&r.  we got pretty drunk.  you guys sounded like you were partying also.  did you have fun? 
 i saw it on the caller id the next day. 
 i saw that you guys called around 4am.  partying huh?  what were you guys doing until 4? 
 sorry i didn't make it over sat, i passed out.  how was sat? 
 yeah.  i am going to a dinner at pappas steakhouse and then going to party.  i will call you at 2am. 
 party girl 
 what are you doing tonight? 
 don't worry.  you and jen just need to be ready to party. 
 i will.  i will sleep in the middle.  sat is going to be the best day of my life. 
 i slept on the edge.  you kept tugging on the covers and tried to spoon with me.  its cool though. 
 it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don= 't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is ju= st good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the= part about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it = especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut = up nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was= real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as mazi= arz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that= i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decid= ed to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i loo= ked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at f= irst i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails p= ossibly get here?  but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had= a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he = didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured o= ut how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company w= ide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt prett= y embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to= the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now = he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wid= e email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i= know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip c= lubs. =20   MFL 
 stay at your place even though you are a bed hog 
 yep.  looks like i found the formula. 
 you are so mean.  why can't you be sweet like me? 
 just kidding.  you need to relax a little. 
 i am going to the strip club.  do you want to meet me there?  i will get you a lap dance. 
 i resent that too 
 i resent that last comment 
 i am gonna buy you a bmw 
 it is so easy b/c you get all worked up and you are not sure whether to believe me or not. 
 you have such a temper. 
 nope.  we talked a couple of times and tenatively planned to go out, but last time i called she didn't call back.  she sounded like she has a situation w/ her ex or she just might not like me.  that is hard to belive though. 
 just chill girl. 
 it isn't that big of a deal.  why don't you just relax about the whole thing. 
 no.  you are so gullable. 
 ok 
 yeah.  i think we are hitting the strip clubs. 
 i am ready to go tonight.  you going out? 
 where didn't i go? 
 no really.  it was a blast.  little tired but i can rally for tonight. 
 i didn't even go home 
 how are we doing on our contest? 
 how was mitch's bday? 
 we will see what the line is.  either you will take it or you wont.  don't try to negotiate. 
 i don't like double standards being put on me.  i am the only one that can do double standards. 
 don't be fucking stupid.  i wouldn't do it straight up when i could get points. 
 our going out contest.  are we starting that tonight or do you concede?  i don't know why she thinks i am high maintanence. 
 i just heard that before and tori was joking w/ me about that.  i don't get it.  are we starting our contest tonight? 
 do you think i am high maintanence? 
 i dont think you look like her anymore.  my judgement was off that day.  i was around paint fumes looking at houses. 
 tori over here thinks bonnie is a hottie. 
 just did.  let me know what she says. 
 oh.   that is different than your first response. quite different.  i am going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks. 
 i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like on my birthday when we just slammed everything as fast as we could. 
 your mom didn't say she was ugly.  stop lying.  i think that girl is hot so i don't care. 
 i am all hot and bothered. 
 oh my god!  i am all worked up here at work.  i am going to find you a hottie right now. 
 does that mean you would do it even if i didn't win $80million 
 i thought it was.  i think that girl is hot.  if i won $80million that is the girl i want you to hook up with. 
 whatever.  i try to be nice and pay you a compliment and you turn it on me.  i guess i will just never compliment you again. 
 those photos are all stretched out.  i can't believe you don't think she is pretty 
 whatever.  i think you are messing around and you probably love the comparisson. 
 http://www.bonniebernstein.freeservers.com/  this is the site and she doesn't look like a man.  danm it. 
 i just did that and she is not in there.  she does not look like a man.  she is a hottie. 
 did you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it as an indication. 
 are you sure you are looking at the correct one b/c i don't see her on yahoo.  i think you are lying b/c she is not gross. 
 where did you look her up?  i dont know what you are talking about b/c she is skinny and pretty. 
 she isn't gross .  she is hot.  you need to see her on tv.  like i said, that is not a great pic. 
 http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/chat/2000/cbs/bernstein112000.htm  this is a photo of the girl i think you look like but it isn't really a good pic. 
 you know i can't wait to see you 
 if you act enthusiastic(sp?) then you'll be enthusiastic(sp?)! 
 good.  that is what i like to hear. 
 what do you mean you guess? 
 7:30-8.  how does that sound? 
 what time you coming over 
 did you get a stripper? 
 i thought your first offer sucked. 
 i cannot make it.  my parents will be in town this weekend. 
 i am not going to do that.  my job is too good here.  i want to live in denver, but i want the job i have here.  i can go there later.  hopefully i will get paid and it will work out. 
 not much.  i am trying to sell my house so i have been looking for a new house recently.  there are some cool things that i have found.  i have been going out a little, but not like we did in the beginning of the year.  that was fun.  when i move i will throw a big party and we can start it up again. 
 your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english.  i was wondering why you didn't respond.  jury duty sucks huh?  have you been going out at all? 
 times are getting tight for me.  i really liked that house i saw yesterday.  i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me. 
 that is working out perfect for you 
 if you win lets go to applebys and if i win lets go to redwood grill. 
 i don't think so.  sometimes the sun shines on a dogs ass but i don't see that happening again. 
 here is our bet on cu/a&m game this summer.  i have cu -8.  we can think of a dinner later. 
 that is nasty 
 you probably didn't even see it 
 what game 
 i hope he doesn't publish this and respond to it today. 
 ditto 
 that is all we can do is attack his mom.  i am all for it.  she should be ashamed of producing such a jackass. 
 are you leaving in 15 min or something?   i think i am out of here.  i need a haircut. 
 i am sure they are.  houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.  economy should be good here. 
 b/c i wanted to read a story freak 
 someone should tear him a new one, but it is hard to argue any of his points 
 she is waiting to see if she can get financing. 
 i got a few of them.  i have a rash now in my lap. 
 i am going to stay in.  i need to find a house. 
 i am too tired to type 
 i'm bored.  tell me a story. 
 alright.  talk to you later. 
 yeah 
 probablyl gonna just kick it 
 you know, whatever.  i will let you know later.  what are you doing tonight. 
 i can think of a few things 
 sad but true. 
 real sweet.  you have a stone heart. 
 you should see the rash 
 um, i don't remember that. 
 i am tired b/c i kept waking up with no covers and my butt was hanging off the bed. i looked at you and you were covered up to your neck with the covers in the middle of the bed.  you look like you slept well. 
 i am tired.  your dog kept me up all night. 
 math is universal.  me =/ jerk 
 yeah.  it is math. 
 me > dog 
 i guess i do but i wouldn't be suprised either way.  you can show me it this weekend. 
 how many ounces does that little runt bailey weigh? 
 now i know you are lying.  yesterday the lie was about a poodle.  why can't you just be honest with me?  the lies and deceit hurt me erin. 
 what color is your poodle 
 i felt fine.  i was just tired but i didn't feel bad.  my golf game sucks but that is b/c i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago.  this swing is going to take me  to the next level.  i think if trading doesn't work out i will have something to fall back on. 
 it isn't oozing, just itching.  it was worth every penny.  i think this hooker really liked me. 
 sweet.  you can start by picking up the tab at capital grill. 
 both 
 sorry man.  can't make it.  i have a dinner at cafe annie's tonight 
 pay more than i want.  so from now on you need to pay when we go out. 
 i havent looked anymore.  i will look this weekend.   i think i need to pay more than i want to.  how old is your dog? 
 i don't believe you b/c i don't think you would not have had time to get it yesterday when you said you had it 
 stop lying 
 this situation reminds me of kids with imaginary friends.  what is your imaginary friend's name? 
 did you get any sleep last night with your new dog?  when do i get to see this alleged dog? you probably got one of those robotic dogs.  what is its name? 
 you didn't buy a dog.  i want to see the receipt. 
 thanks.  i heard boone was in rare form though.  i am dead tired right now. 
 why?  don't you think you would lose that bet? 
 lets bet your dinner on it right now.  i think i might need to pay up to get a house 
 you did not 
 did you get a lil' chihuahua?  i hate those things. 
 i couldnt see it b/c it was surrounded by a wooden fence.  i know you didn't get a dog.  unless you took one of your 2 hour breaks before lunch. 
 i think that all they do is bark and freak out.  they aren't good dogs.  they aren't friendly.  and i am not angry. 
 look, damn it, they have all the personality in the world and they are not that big.  i don't think you know what a cockerspaniel is. 
 yeah i had one.   her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded.  all dogs are dumb.  they are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak. 
 your retarded.  i used to have one.  they are great dogs. 
 i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock. 
 i think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get their asses kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel. 
 are you kidding?  why would you want a chihuahua?  those dogs aren't even friendly.  do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog? 
 it depends what type you get.  if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that dog.  if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place.  those little furry dogs act like cats. 
 only if i have a bad day.  if i have a bad day will you let me come over and kick it? 
 when are you getting your dog dog? 
 lisa lisa-  what have you been up to?  you still moving to india or is your buddy moving back here. 
 could you please remove me from this distribution 
 what is the website address? 
 great.  way to go.  you will lose this weekend. 
 dietz's bachelor party was ok.  we did the same thing that we did at val's.  i am not going to the tenn game.  i might go to the florida game. 
 i don't know but i don't want to make it.  i just want to stay home. 
 i got home fine.  what was the name of that book you told me about?  was it the 4th deminsion? 
 congrats tom tom.  you can reach me at: 1212 fairview #A houston  77006 
 i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday. 
 boudreaux-  what's up?  are you going to the tenn game? 
 i am not sure if i am moving or not.   i wont know until the beginning of the year.  i am back and forth on the decision.  i am glad your sis is ok.  i did get a room for 160.  i am sure i will split it with some of those guys. 
 around 4-5pm 
 good job mcfly! 
 7138258410.  how did you drop your phone in water? 
 what is up jill?  i just got in town last night so i am not sure where i am going to watch the game.  what have you been up to?  i am definately going to party after the game.  give me a call later and i will let you know where we are going to watch the game. 
 tim should have it.  so are you getting nervous.  vegas rocked.  what time does the wedding start and how long of a drive is it?  i bet you're nervous.  let me know if we need to keep  a car running out front. 
 i am glad to hear it.  it is  ok, it isn't like i need the money or anything.  how was your date? 
 did you get her to sign a service contract?  i won about $700 
 thanks for that email.  i just opened it and everyone say that shoot across all 4 screens of mine.  i will talk to you later b/c i have to go up to hr now. 
 i am interested in going to the game.  i could be up for it. 
 give me a shout at work when you get a chance.  853-7176. 
 that will get us to baton rouge in time for ou/nu 
 weather looks like this:  hi 69  lo 42 
 does anyone have that email where that ut dude gets all drunk?  i need to read it for inspiration. 
 oops i did it again 
 we will definately go party.  i went to the game and it sucked.  so your test is this weekend or the following?  sat there is a big party at garden in the heights. 
 what time are you going to get into town? 
 i am going to watch lsu sat and then go to that party at garden in the heights.  should be fun. let me know what is going on for your party celebration when you finish. 
 nothing happened with either.  so what is up with the divorced girl?  do you know her? 
 nope. 
 the enron stock is down again.  13 days in a row. 
 13 days straight.  it is trading just over $11. 
 it is going to zero 
 i might go out.  i don't think that i am dressing up.  are you going out?  i would be up for going out, but i have nothing to dress up in. 
 i don't want to be a soilder during the war.  where are you going if you go out?  sierra?  let me knwo if you decide to go out b/c i think it would be a fun night. 
 the only thing at la strada is a bunch of nancy boys.  are your friends trying to meet gay guys or are they gay? 
 that is probably what i will end up doing.  i need to find some really nice smelling oil though. 
 what happened to the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again this year? 
 does that make a nice scent when baby oil and lotion are mixed?  i am first going to rub fake tan all over and then grease up.  i am just going to wear my new thong and my new gold bracelet.  i am going to look awesome when i am dancing.  i don't know what you should be.  i think you can do better than gi jane though.  you could be an umpalumpa for willy wonka.  everyone loves those little guys. 
 anyone going out for halloween tonight? 
 potentially 
 i want to come over and meet some milfs also. 
 step up and go out like a man.  stop crying like a lil' bitch.   sierra is gonna be packed with girls dressed like lil hookers.  go home, nap and then be ready to go by 8:30-9. 
 call me at home if you go out.  i will be home around 7ish. 
 i didn't get your email in time.  my number is 713-807-1699h and 713-825-8410c.  we went to sierra and it sucked.  total banana farm. 
 i dressed up as a cow with utters and everything.  i walked into sierra and there were only a few people dressed up.  it was so emabarrassing. 
 saturday i am going to woodrows to watch the game and then sat night we are going to the garden in the heights party. 
 good to hear from you.  looks like you got out at the right time.  ene is a sinking ship.  your boy fastow and skilling have sunk it.  are they making you work 100 hour weeks yet? 
 we might go get some food and spirits after work if you are interested.  i am going to butt-fuck mississippi for val's wedding.  i will be in town the rest of the month so i am ready to start tearing up houston again.  let me know if you are up for drinks after work. 
 i am tired.  you snore. 
 you guys want to watch the game at woodrows tomorrow?  there will be some girls there and then we can get them to meet up with us at that garden in the heights party later that night.  plus we can be outside watching it. 
 that isn't snoring, that is the sound of my teeth chattering b/c i have no covers. 
 you love it when i come over.  i satisfy your appetitie for lovin. 
 i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out. 
 you don't know what that means?  where did you grow up? india? 
 them just jokes 
 i just went to dinner.  let me know about thurs.  good luck on the test. 
 are we gonna see somebody boone out? 
 you aren't going in for the wedding until sunday now? 
 just call me on my cell phone.  i am going to happy hour after work to eat and drink. 
 what do you mean i am perverted? 
 thank god.  i feel so much better.  i was worrying about it in the shower this morning.   thanks for letting me know. 
 we are meeting these people sunday morning at 10:30am to go to the golf tourney.  i will have to pick you up around 10 or you can meet me at my house at 10. 
 excellent idea.  meet you at my house then.  great. 
 too late.  meet me at my house. 
 i still need to decide whether or not i am going.  i think this guy is putting an offer on my house and i might need to look for a house.  how was bama?  did you party after we rolled them or was kenny to pissed? 
 i might go.  depends on this week. 
 http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/WolfFiles/wolffiles.html 
 what is a better restaurant to work at? house of pies or denny's? 
 fat ass 
 there is a band?  what is going on this weekend? 
 just kidding 
 calling you a fat ass.  i am serious about which restaurant is better. 
 denver defense sucks 
 it is tough to watch because they cant stop shit.  i need to email the paper and complain in this article. 
 what the fuck is numbers?  i hate live music. 
 i might be up for it though 
 looks like becoming a waiter is a better possibility every day. 
 the stock is below $10 and the company might go bankrupt. 
 i applied at house of pies last night. 
 what are the odds of enron making it.  seems that we are in a cash crunch. 
 let me know when you want to go out.  i can go out any night. 
 i am not joking.  it will just be temporary until i get back on my feet. 
 the assets are marked up and we cant sell them.  the problem is that we have tapped out our credit lines and we need another $2 billion.  seems like we are racing against the clock. 
 i know.  i love working here.  i wish it would just get fixed.  i don't think mgmt has informed us of what is going on completely. 
 i won't be a waiter for more than a year.  it takes time.  it isn't like i will change my profession to a waiter.  it will just be something to pay the bills.  i don't know why it is so hard for you to understand that.  i haven't heard about my house. 
 i am serious 
 just getting applications at denny's, house of pies, appleby's and chilis 
 are you not going to stand by me through this? 
 kam - could you give me access to view this site please.  my login is mlenhar.  thanks 
 it works.  thanks again. 
 looks like i am going to work at denny's. stock is down about another 2.50. 
 did they look lazy?  they always seem over-confident. 
 sweet.  i need a golf allowance then.   i can drink beer every night and golf all day while you work.  that would be so sweet of you.  i cant wait to do that. 
 yeah.  just go ahead and do that.  how about the houstonian?  youre  the best. 
 can i just charge the spa to your account?  so now that i am your boy toy what do you want me to do? 
 ok sweet baby 
 it wont let me in.  says i need to login. 
 7:30 or 8.  i don't care when. 
 dyron 
 i can't wait 
 can't believe you left last night. 
 daily dose on enron -  we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket. 
 sounds fun.  i think i am going to go out there at lunch and get some dancing in. 
 i didn't want you to go.  i was just going to sleep anyway.  i was too tired to give you any action.  enron is blowing up. 
 i am going to sell my car and use the money to get the field.  go- go dancers everywhere. 
 http://biz.yahoo.com/e/011108/ene.html 
 i have stronger will than you think. house of pies here i come. 
 you just need it all the time don't you.  don't you like me for me?  or am i just a boy toy to you? 
 i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested.  jill allen finishes her cpa today and she and her friends are going to party. 
 max and jen are looking for you.  call them at 303-832-8160.  they haven't heard from you in a while. 
 ruggles at dyron 
 it isn't going to be happy.  let's just call it what it is " deal with being unemployed hour at the bar". 
 you didn't think that was funny?  do i need to explain that one? 
 i say we go to tealas and sit on the porch. 
 sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i didn't get home until late.  looks bad over here.  everything was business as usual until yesterday.  i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair.  i will call you later. 
 dynegy trades around their assets.  they aren't big risk takers like enron.  looks like the deal is now done.  now we just need to wait and see what happens. 
 this article mentions your chapter of sigma chi. 
 game is on tv tomorrow. 
 how did you do on your test? 
 no.  i was home before 10.  definately party tonight and golf tomorrow. 
 they inked the deal.  dynegy has aquired us. 
 sounds good.  have a good time.  i think i am going to stay in town and golf.  we will go party some other time. 
 tux has been ordered.  speech is being considered. 
 no problem.  hull said it wouldn't be a good party anyway.  you know you didn't fall asleep, it is called passing out. 
 what is your cell number again 
 http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IPIX&d=c&k=c1&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l 
 do you still want to go out tonight? 
 i don't know about you guys, but i feel a lot better after reading that. 
 now i know something will get done. 
 of course i do.  i want to see my sweet baby.  how was your day off.  did you buy me an xmas gift? 
 don't be cruel 
 maybe. why? 
 so everyone is pretty pissed over here b/c there is a report that ken lay will get $80 million if he doesn't join the new company.  he is getting a golden parachutte for ruining the company. 
 i have fri off. 
 people are pretty upset todya.  they have completely fleeced us. 
 you didn't send the number.  just call me on mine @ 7138258410.  i am thinking tealas and sitting out on the porch. 
 i will pick you up around 7:30-8. 
 1212 fairview #a houston  77006 
 pins and needles. 
 there is a credit spread b/t ice and eol for phys transactions 
 yeah baby.  i am a limited partner. 
 they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset.  the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire.  skilling and fastow bolted.  i have no respect for them.  i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89, but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110.  not 90 down to 10. 
 what is going on?  did you end up going out on sat? 
 r&r was fun.  we went downtown first and it sucked.  i felt like i was in kabul w/ all of al queda.  r&r was packed though.  i didn't get there until around 1am.  when are you going home? 
 that is disgusting.  watch for me i will be the one dancing like a maniac. 
 i am going to stay here.  i am going to the ut/a&m game on fri.  i am just looking forward to hanging out and relaxing.  i need to get some sleep, relax and get my mind off of enron.  seems like it is day to day on whether or not we are going out of business.  it is wearing on me. 
 i want to see what my market value is.  i don't know what is going to happen here.  if you want to do a happy hour let me know.  maybe tomorrow after work or something.  let me know if you are up for it. 
 i guess i won't take paige to this 
 take her to the atl 
 jill arrington has a bright future ahead of her. 
 i think that i need to give my resume to your brother in law.  enron is collapsing. 
 definately.  tell him i trade west basis in the natural gas market.  i appreciate it. 
 yeah.  i can email it to you.  i will give you a call later tonight. 
 sorry i didn't get back to you last night.  i was on the other line with paige.  i am so pumped about her. 
 430 is good 
 sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i got home around 9:30.  i will give you a call tonight.  how about the huskers?  that was violent. 
 mostly internal trading.  bidweek starts today, so we will see if physical volume picks up. 
 what are you going to dc for? 
 do you know those girls? 
 i was going to come home this weekend if you knew them.  we would have to set up a service contract with those chicks. 
 that was great.  that is as funny as i get. 
 what is shawn's cell phone number?  he was supposed to stay at my place last night and he didn't show up. 
 yeah baby.  i was there two weeks ago and there were hotties everywhere.  i am going to come home in the early part of july and we will figure out the final details. 
 i found a bunch of tickets to fargo.  most run through minneapolis.  the cheapest is $432.  the earliest arrives at 12:30 and they have one at 2, 3, 5.  let me know what you guys have and i will coordinate the times accordingly. 
 those were pretty good.  how is everything in phoenix?  it looks hot. 
 it was supposed to have some pics 
 cotton bowl 
 that is how i impress girls.  maybe that is why they don't understand me.  i am so deep.  i am so misunderstood. 
 you partied it up at jazz fest?  i still have never been.  who did you go there with? 
 yeah i will be in town this weekend.  i have something to go to fri but i will definately be out on saturday.  what are you doing? 
 i think she is one of jen's cougar friends.  that is such a chick thing to do. 
 read the bottom of the email with some chicks idea as a gift 
 i am sure that girl courtney walker would like to share some special memories also 
 sure.  you buy something and let me know how much i owe 
 so i got us a hotel room in caymen.  it can sleep up to six and it is $880 for the three nights.  if all 5 of us stay there that is 176/ea.  we have it for thurs-sat night. 
 jen's dad better buy a bunch of booze.  and the schrutt's better take us somewhere nice for the rehersal dinner.  and jen's friends better put out. 
 what is the date of the party 
 i tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look? st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time. 
 that is classy 
 what  time is golf for? 
 does anyone have a picture of max when he used to walk around and flex his pecs? 
 i will be there 
 that does sound gay 
 season over 
 i am ready to take some more of your money out there 
 he is there best player 
 oops 
 the texas bet was that they wouldn't win the national championship within the next 3 years. 
 i have to go to a dinner tonight, but i will meet up with you guys at the grasshopper if you want.  we need to check that joint out.  call me on my cell and we will hit it. 
 didn't you go to grasshopper last night 
 was it any good 
 let's meet up at grasshopper 
 thanks for the xmas card.  that was real nice. 
 i would but i am going to the spa 
 whatever gillette.  i will be feeling all loose and relaxed while i am whooping it up at the grasshopper tonight. 
 everyone who is anyone will be there. 
 i will be the prettiest at the grasshopper 
 meeting up with boone and luis and whoever.  if the broker goes we will just get some free drinks.  date went well.  i had a good time. 
 did you just get that reply? 
 are you going out this weekend?  i think you said you had a wedding to go to or something?     were you hurting on wednes morning? 
 i thought that you were going 
 yeah baby!   that place is gonna rock 
 i don't know.  i am going to golf sunday morning at the woodlands which is very nice.  i don't want to be real hung over, but i still might go out. tonight i am definately going out. 
 you were right about my flight time.  i will see you at the passenger pickup. 
 i felt fine.  i woke up at 5am to work out.  i guess you are just a candy ass.  just kidding.  i have a dinner to go to tonight with some broker then i am heading downtown.  i will give you a call this weekend.  have fun at the wedding. 
 i tried to call yesterday, but you guys were not home.  i did speak with grandma and grandpa.  grandpa sounded really bad.  i am a little worried after speaking with him.  he sounded to tired to even speak.  i think i need to get out to phoenix to see them soon. 
 give me a call from dc when you get a chance.  love matt 
 i felt like a champ on sat 
 i didn't do all those shots with boone 
 Derek-  Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
 we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
 did you call for me at work today? 
 did you call me today at work 
 how was your wedding on saturday? 
 i will be in town fri afternoon.  tell max and  i  will see you guys either fri or sat.

 i wasn't that drunk on saturday.  i was just joking.  i felt great on saturday.  like a champ.  people get married younger than you?  wow.  what the hell do they do if they get married that early? 
 i had to wake up early on sunday so i didnt feel like going.  were there a lot of hotties? 
 i will be here on fri night, but sat i am going to tim's engagement party.  i think i will be out on fri. 
 i am here dog 
 yeah, paincourtville, la.  i don't know where the fuck that is. 
 i will be watching.  have fun 
 dont try to play it off.  you just cant spell. 
 not me.  i wont get a vette unless i am 50, single & have a mustache.  if i need to pick up the young cheesey babes when i am old i will get one.  i never heard of that movie. 
 nothing.  i am pissed.  i got out of a position too early and i would have made a killing. 
 i will be home fri afternoon. i will see you and max fri or sat. 
 i can't make that 
 how is everything going?  are you guys staying cool down there.  i know it has been hot.  i will try to call soon. 
 i didn't take profits.  got slaughtered today. i had a great month last month, i just need to get out of this hole this month.  at least it is the first.  i will talk to you sunday. 
 i have to be in denver that weekend for a family function.  what about labor day?  we could go that fri & sat night and fly back sun.  we would have monday off to recover.  lsu is playing some schmeg team any way.  there will be more cougars in vegas over labor day also.  cougars are good back up plan at the end of the night. 
 what is up monkey?  things are  good in houston.  i still have a gambling problem so i am gonna try to go to vegas if i can.  are you in california still.  i bet you have a 15 year old girlfriend huh?  you and mark chumura hitting the prom parties.  drinking cold beer and getting hot pussy is still what it is about.  even though we work you need to get those essentials. they are like air.  we did it right in college when we were running those chi - o's.  you should try to get to h-town one weekend and we will run some cougars.  cougars= old women that pray on young men.   cougars love me here.  give me a shout some time.  713-853-7176.  good to hear from you. 
 labor day is the working man's holiday.  since most of us work we should celebrate the holiday (and jacques and val's weddings) that weekend in vegas. 
 saints suck.  tigers play the louisiana school for the deaf.  you wont miss anything.  i thought you were a 49ers fan? 
 i just spoke with wayne gonzalin and he said that there is a rodney impersonator there the same weekend.  tickets are only $4.95 and that includes an all you can eat hot dog buffet.  it is just 27 miles outside of town so we can hit that and then go play nickel slots. 
 Ivan-  I put the files in  O\portland\fundamentals\westgas\new folder(2).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Matt 3-7176 
 doesn't matter.  it won't happen either way. 
 I put the files under o\dropbox\west.  They are the files titled CEMS, CEMS CA Gen, CEMS CA Heat Rate, & Cali Gen (CEMS). 
 if it is only nick and i who can't make it on the 24th you guys should go. it is going to be hard any  time to get a weekend that everyone can agree on.  don't let us hold you back. 
 i can make the 24th of aug now 
 it went fine.  i am just glad that it is over.  i am now looking foward to the cruise.  hope all is well. 
 good news everyone!  looks like denver is gonna get steve young.  pencil us in for the superbowl.  i think that would make us a dynasty. 
 i know.  i am trying to make superbowl bets now. 
 both billy joe's were still under contract so the broncos had to get young. saints could have had scrubby brister if they had played their cards right. 
 nuggets will win the nba next year 
 i bet i can guess which ones 
 sailing 
 i am up for whatever.  let's just try to get something planned before xmas. 
 get your touches this week b/c next week i am gonna put it up at least 40 times. 
 yeah.  we can rent a hobie boat and go sailing 
 i wanted to let you know i might be in for that weekend.  i am going to try to go home labor day instead.  i will know by mon. 
 Phillip-  Here is the presentation.  I also sent it to Ina. 
 my goal is to pull off a double play - unassisted. 
 we need to reschedule the cruise? 
 my lessons were cancelled.  i cant take them until july now.  how was austin?  i saw your friends at the black swan. 
 i forgot to call them yesterday.  i will try tonight.  i leave sat for n.o. for the cruise.  i will be back the following sunday. 
 when?  eventually or are you giving your notice at work? 
 so you are serious about this 
 i don't know 
 who is that? 
 get me a ticket if you can.  chad is a mullet. 
 who is diamond dallas page? 
 your kids will end up on mulletsgalore 
 well if we have kids they definately are not watching wrestling.  if that is your choice of programing, i won't let them watch tv with you. 
 you will have an allowance that i will monitor closely. 
 i will have you sign a prenuptual 
 we are going to new orleans sat and set sail sun.  for this summer i might go home for a weekend and to vegas for a bachelor party.  you? 
 any word on the houston opportunity? 
 how?  daddy always gets action. 
 too much beer retention on my six pack.  but my calves and thighs are so sculpted.  works of art. 
 lets drive in your new car 
 i will call them tonight.  they probably want to see you inagural for sure so hopefully the labor day weekend will be a good weekend for them to stay through. 
 Cooper-  Can you let me know how to connect to the power database where we pull CAISO scheduled gen & load.  I want to pull the actual loads along with the scheduled.  Get back to me when you get a chance.  Matt Lenhart 853-7176 
 i will give you all that until you are 50, then i will turn you in for a 20 year old hottie.  sorry i didn't call you back last night. 
 jacques-  i think i should be able to go that weekend.  just wanted to let you know since i hadn't rsvp'd. 
 i am in. 
 where is this workbook and how do i link to it? 
 if you can get me a ticket i will go. 
 nice. 
 you signed a prenup.  you will need a job. 
 i know who that is.  wasn't she a cheerleader?  how have you been?  i haven't heard from you in a while.  i will try to meet up with you guys tonight. call me at my house and let me know what time you guys are heading over. 
 yeah, i will.  she is great.  she thinks i am smart b/c i read the comics. plus she had a breast job. 
 you are right.  you are one of a kind.  i am lucky to have you.  you are buying some time past 50.  you just added another year or two (depends if i have all my hair or not). 
 it is not going to happen.  if i get hair on my back i will get it surgically removed.  anyway i don't have to worry about hair on my back. 
 yeah i need to get you a boob job.  i like DD.  work out your lower back b/c you are gonna have to carry my trophies around forever. 
 i like you the way you are, but i think you will look great with dd's 
 daddy is in. 
 tigers play at 6.  i think we are going to go to two rows to catch the game if you are up for it. 
 well you are gonna have to work out for 2 hours a day.  i want you to stay in top shape.  you can be my trophy wife.  are you really moving to austin soon? 
 my status is questionable now. 
 i can't wait for the cruise.  i will watch out for the hot women on the boat.  i might just stay in grand caymen and run a boat business if it is really nice there.  i want to go to denver over labor day weekend.  if you guys go up for the inagural it would be the following weekend.  memorial day would give me an extra day off. if you guys cannot stay through that weekend i will try to go over the 18th.  i will try to call tonight or tomorrow.  love matt 
 that is the saddest story i ever heard.  my security guard girlfriend work at night as a tow truck lady and she probably got pissed when she saw me hanging out with you guys and towed your car.  actually i don't think the game is going to play until 8:30.  here are your tasks for next week while i am out of town: 1. plan your party 2. get music 3. get food 4. get booze 5. invite some people 6.  let me know what i owe you  sounds good.  if the game comes on at 6 and we go to two rows i will let you know.  is your old ass boyfriend coming to the party? 
 i will only say it is our party if it is fun.  if it sucks it is all you. i am not going out tonight.  game is on at 8:30 and i will just watch it at home.  i need my beauty sleep before the cruise.  my security guard girlfriend doesn't have an email address (she doesn't have a computer), but she does have an instant message pager.  you should try to buy some new cd's before your party. 
 i am not reading that in public 
 by the way, your book is way overdue 
 i thought you sniffed that stuff on the weekend for fun anyway 
 austin is a cool place to live even if you are not in school.  i wouldn't live in baton rouge and i loved going to school there.  you should do what you think is best for you. 
 the lust boat  will be exciting and new 
 i have these hanging on my porch 
 Could one of you send me a foward curve for sp, np & pv.  I need it for our bid week meeting tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks for your help. 
 Cooper-  I cannot run this file.  It keeps prompting me for a password which I don't have. 
 check out the one about "dad's new wife.." 
 These are what I need, but how do I access this info and update it daily? 
 i am going to new orleans tomorrow.  we are staying at chad's and leaving sun morning.  i wanted to know if i could stop by and see the place sat?  i wont stay there and we won't be partying that night.  i just want to see what it looks like now. 
 i am a maybe 
 you really did sniff a lot of that paint 
 you are the woman.  you provide the food and i provide the income.

 i will get in touch with shirley and find out.  one week of boozing, 5 days off, 4 days on. 
 are there any good places to go tubing?  we are thinking about doing that this weekend if you are up for it.  coulon is coming in town.

 are you gonna be in town this weekend?  chad & i are thinking about going tubbing.

 did you mail off the power bill? 
 i don';t know where to go tubing.  we will figure something else out.  maybe you should just throw a pool party.

 tubing is so relaxing.  i have only done it once.  we are trying to figure out things to do for the holiday weekend.  so how come you are going to austin every weekend.  are you in love or something? 
 mom is going to pick me up.  i will bring plenty of luggage.  see you tomorrow. 
 i am not drinking.  i feel like the dude from leaving las vegas

 Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.  Matt Lenhart 
 austin was great.  i love that place.  country grammar is a good song huh? how was your weekend? 
 sorry i didn't call back last night.  i didn't get back until 10.  i will try to call tonight. 
 it was good to see you too.  we should have partied some more.  it is tough to stay in denver for too long now b/c of work.  i think that website is classmates.com.  i am not sure b/c some girl here was on the website and that is where i saw dana's personal ad.  i was so funny b/c lisa wimbush said " i am 24 and engaged"  and dana said " i am 24 and single".  everyone at work was laughing.  i hope you are having fun in san fransico.  keep in touch.  matt

 it was fun.  i had a blast.  my liver is still recovering?  did you hear grandma won a truck?  that is amazing.  what has been going on there? 
 i don't have hair on my back and not that much on my chest.  i wish i had more on my chest then i could grow a mustache and tell the chicks to call me magnum. 
 where do yo get tickets for prague.  i need to get two.  i am gonna stay in town.  we are heading to champs for the game if you want to go.

 lets go to new orleans.  that sounds good to me.  i don't know how i got such a good deal but i am psyched up.  i can't wait. 
 are you getting a used car or a new car?  maximas are good.  i like the older models though. 
 why don't you get a 95 maxima.  i think you can get those for around $10 or lower and just finance the rest. 
 those are cool.  maybe you should just keep yours until it is dead.  doesn't make sense to pay more since you just bought a new place.  how many bedrooms is it?  what is the new number? 
 set up a trip in oct.  maybe we can get a long weekend.  maybe lsu plays one day and we could check that out.  i will take a look.

 i will make it .  remind me thurs.

 call me about it tonight 
 new years was fun.  i stayed in town and went to that club prague.  that place is crazy.   were you in new york through the end of the year?  i haven't heard of a natl champ party, but i think you should throw one. 
 are you burning up up there?  looks like it has been over 100.  i bought a new car.  i get it today. 
 i sold the jeep monday to some kid going to a&m next fall.  i bought a chevy tahoe.  it is great.  i pick it up today. it is midnight blue with a tan stripe at the bottom.  i got an incredible deal on it.  it is a 1998 and i was looking at 96's that were selling for more.  it is probably a little too nice for me, but what the hell. 
 mom said that you needed my phone number.  it is (713)807-1699.

 tom white from enron?  why did he want me to give him a call?  i want to live in florida now.  maybe he knows of some good areas to check out. 
 is that the guy from enron? 
 i knew about trickett but  not the other guy. 
 he isn't ceo of enron.  he is a ceo of one of the subsidiaries.  still a big wig and multi-multi millionaire. 
 you haven't received the toys r us stuff yet?

 i bought a ride on friday.  it is a pretty cool car - kind of retro.  i bought a gremlin, like the one in wayne's world.  some people laugh at it, but i think it is pretty cool.  it is also affordable.  tell angie she can't get into a fist fight.  i don't want to be embarassed if we all go out.  you guys can't throw your central gang signs or whatever you guys do before you represent. 
 it is purple.  i am going to paint the tires yellow and it will be the official car of the lsu alumni club. 
 thanks for your analysis ron jaworski. 
 that is fine.  i should be there around 5:30. 
 chicks dig gremlins. 
 Here are some of the California power sheets I have put together using your database.  I have filled in the historical data using the CEMS database, but that only runs through March-00.  Let me know what you think b/c there seems to be holes in the data. 
 around 8.  i was too dead to get up.  i will get it today.  his buddy adam got arrested that night for public intoxication. 
 are you gonna play or just tell us to hustle from the bench? 
 mick-  of the three colts the one you definately don't want with the 4th pick is marvin harrison.  i will trade you the 1st pick.  i have an offer for you if you want to look at it.

 what is going on in dallas?  is that where you are from?  i heard it is fun to go out up there.  i am staying in town this weekend b/c i have sailing lessons.  i am going to go out sat night if i don't get sea sick.  i got sea sick when i was on the cruise so i don' t think that i am going to be much of a sailor.  let me know if you guys have a happy hour. 
 we should just not show up next week.  it is a 9 o'clock game against dudes who are going to embarrass us.  i would rather watch the real world or something. 
 admit it.  you watch road rules and real world.  you stay home all day sunday on the couch and watch 20-30 consecutive episodes.  i know you do b/c the only other thing on is nascar. 
 scroll down to the bottom of the email and double click on the attached file 
 something was wrong with the email system and all the emails i sent a week ago are getting there now.  everyone is emailing me asking what the hell my emails mean.  i pay attention to your emails. 
 i am going to stay home tonight.  i need my beauty sleep. it is also nice being at home alone b/c chad is out of town.  i probably won't go out until sat. 
 that sounds great.  thanks a lot. 
 who is inga? 
 you know what my porn name is?  it is francis marion.  you can figure yours out by taking your middle name and adding it to the name of the street you grew up on. 
 it sucks to be somewhere flat for new years 
 you always think that i am lying. 
 you are going to pat benatar?  i wouldn't admit that at work, you might get demoted.  i am not going out tonight.  i need my beauty sleep.  i am planning on sat night so either call me at home or on my cell (713)8258410. 
 I just wanted to rsvp for the ENA function on Aug. 2.  Matt Lenhart 
 looks like i might be coming to denver for a couple of days the first or second week of august.  i don't know how much time i will have but i will let you know the plans next week.  there is some kind of gas convention called coga held up there.  i think i will be golfing and meeting with people some of the time.  i should have some time though and we can get together.  i will let you know.  matt 
 i think i might be going to this gas conference on aug 7th.  that is a monday.  if that is the case, i will try to fly into town either fri night or saturday so i can have more time there.  i will let you know more monday. 
 i don't know the number at the hotel so you cant call me to move.  sorry. 
 Matt Lenhart 3208A 3-7176 Supervisor: Phillip Allen 
 i just got my ticket for vegas.  i am arriving fri the 18th at 7:30pm.  be ready to party b/c money doesn't sleep big boy. 
 i got my ticket for fri the 18th.  i arrive in vegas at 7:30.  be ready to party b/c "money doesn't sleep". 
 how was new years?  i stayed in town and went to prague. 
 i would like the broncos newsletter 
 wild west sucks.  the only good thing was that there was $1 beers.  i hated country music and there were a ton of necks there.  how was that movie? 
 looks like i will get to denver tues, aug 8th in the afternoon and leave thurs aug 10 in the afternoon.  i wont have much time but we will figure something out.  i have to work in the mornings out of the denver office and then we have some seminars to go to in the afternoon and some golf tourneys. i will figure something out and let you know. 
 what is the current head count on this trip? 
 it wasn't that bad.  i didn't get my ass kicked by some rednecks so it was ok.  you going out this week?  i might go out thurs.  if not we will hit downtown this weekend.  i will even drive my gremlin out. 
 i will have a little time.  one night you will have to hit the town.  drinks on the corp card. 
 it was scary but terrible?  how was volcanoes? 
 two steppin' is for people who cant dance & i am a great dancer so therefore i do not two step. 
 you guys like the worst places.  wild wild west, surf side sally's.  please tell me that the party won't end up at "shock 2000: the radioactive dance factory".  just let me know the plans & i will be there. 
 volcanoes was full of hotties?  i should have been there.  i might skip adrians and meet up with everyone later.  i hate adrians.  who knows. 
 tough loss.  pac 10 sure is tough for texas to beat. 
 you hate erika also. 
 chad is not going b/c he is in a wedding.  tim said he is a game time decision, so i wouldn't count on it right now. 
 i will probably go to woody's thurs if i have a good week. 
 why aren't you going? 
 tell him to take us out on it.  how much does a boat like that cost? 
 i am definately going to the tenn game.  i am going to try to make at least three games.  it is hard to do these trips as a student with no steady income.  give me a call when you get a chance. 
 i will try to get those names for you today.  if i don't do it today just remind me and i will get it done asap. 
 you going to vegas.  i just got my ticket. 
 i would sell my house and move on the boat.  i would probably buy a pet alligator to keep on deck to protect my property.  golf this weekend if i don't have sailing lessons.  they bagged me on the lessons last weekend. 
 send me that picture again.  i accidently deleted it. 
 jeff-  could you get me access to a foward curve for pv, np, & sp? thanks for your help.  matt 
 you are an 832.  i would try to get that changed as quickly as possible.  you don't want to be an 832.   i did get your message.  you love that song don't you? 
 yeah but i  am not going to tell people you are an 832.  if you meet a guy don't give him that number right away until you thinks he likes you b/c that could be a deal breaker. 
 i have a late basketball game tomorrow night that i forgot about. 
 probably around 10.  if not tomorrow definately thurs. 
 who cares about the last 4 digits?  it is the area code that matters. 
 just in case you didn't see it- 4 broncos made the 1st team all decade team. elway is the starter and your boy in sf didn't even make 2nd team tim. 
 you say brister could make the all decade team throwing to rice and young couldn't?  that is not saying much for your boy.  he is better than brister, just not elway. 
 do i need to stop using my previous i.d. and password and use this instead? 
 i just found out that i get in tues afternoon and leave thurs afternoon.  we will try to get together at least once. 
 i decided not to go b/c nobody really had any plans.  i didn't want to drive either.  chad is moving tomorrow.  are you guys partying this weekend? 
 i am going there for basically two days the second week of aug.  i won't have much time.  hopefully i will meet them for lunch or something but it is definately going to be a short visit.  at least i will be back two weeks later.  did grandma get her truck?    hopefully you and billy can make it over labor day weekend.  i just bought a new car.  it is actually a used chevy tahoe.  i love it.  it is so much nicer than the jeep.  it is too nice for me but as long as i am meeting my goals in savings each month i think i can afford it.  hope all is well.  tell billy hello.  matt 
 i am probably going to go to woody's 
 if anyone is up for getting some drinks at woody's tonight i am in.  i am going to test my new theory out tonight: hot school teachers don't have anything to do in the summer so they go out to try to meet guys with careers that can support them.  it is actually just a hypothesis at this point, but sierra on wednes. has added support.  let me know if you are in. and remember it is the in the name of science.  out 
 you are one of the lead researchers on the project.  we need you. 
 are we golfing sun afternoon? 
 where are you going after adrians. 
 we are going to cadillac and then the swan. 
 who is this? 
 how was woody's when i left?  who all is going out with you on sat? 
 you forgot to add stanford to your list.  i think they worked you over too. 
 me, chad, this dude steve and maybe a straggler or two. 
 are there any hotties coming? 
 how is everything in south florida?  things are busy here.  i am not storming the campuses for sorority chicks, but that isn't a bad idea.  email me your phone number again & i will try to write it down this time. 
 that is funny 
 I have a question on the generation number we are pulling from your database.  The hydro numbers are coming in positive and negative.  Could you please explain the difference there when you get a chance.  Thanks for your help.  Matt Lenhart 
 here is your test.  don't lie. 
 happy belated birthday.  i will try to call tonight.  i was playing golf and didn't get home until 9 last night and went to bed. 
 yeah. don't mess with texas.  i didn't know you called. 
 $50.  not much for a shooter like me.  i will probably win it tonight at liars poker. 
 sure 
 you don't think the saints will make the playoffs now?  just this past weekend you were telling me that your in depth analysis led you to conclude a playoff berth for the saints.  you don't want to back up those statements after the saints preseason opener?  it sounds like every saint fan in august: predicting the playoffs in august and wearing a paperbag on your head by week 5. 
 you spelled sholes wrong. 
 worked good.  i downloaded a few songs from scour.com into your network. they are under c:\program files\napster\music. 
 are you going to buy or just cheer it on? 
 did you change your number?  i called once left a message.  there wasn't a greeting on the machine so i don't know if you got it or not.  i will be in town tues afternoon and i leave thurs afternoon next week.  hopefully we can get together for lunch or breakfast. 
 men's club 
 what city is that area code from? 
 actually i am staying at the adam's mark hotel downtown.  i will definately be able to see you guys at least once.  i am not sure what the schedule is so i will just play it by ear.  i wish i was coming in for the weekend, but the tickets were twice as much and they don't want to pay for my vacation.  call me tonight & i will let you know details. 
 you're hurting my feelings. 
 rocked 
 going out this weekend?  golf maybe tomorrow. 
 give me a call.  i will be home all weekend chillin'.  i will be in denver tues afternoon around 2.  i think we are golfing with customers when we get in and i have a dinner that night.  wednes i am in a golf tourney in the morning so maybe that afternoon we can get together.  i have a dinner wednes night. so if we don't get together wednes afternoon maybe lunch thurs before i take off. 
 this video is so funny.  these two guys are a couple of dumb asses. 
 how did you do on the corruption test? 
 how was new years in new orleans?  did you shoot your 9 in tha air @ 12 
 what did you go to dallas this weekend for?  it wasn't fun?  not much went on here.  i am going to denver tomorrow for work for 3 days.  golfing and boozing.  sounds good huh?  i will be back this weekend but i need to save my money for vegas next week. 
 i am going to vegas for a bachelor party.  should be fun.  i don't think you would have fun with us unless you were jumping out of a cake or something. 
 yeah 
 do a mud pie thing 
 sorry to hear that.  did you pass any of the sections?  this weekend was pretty laid back.  what did you do?  i am trying to save money before i go to vegas in two weeks so i will be laying low for a bit. 
 who sings that 80's song  "harley davidson - of a bitch".  that is the corus. 
 there are hurricanes sprouting up everywhere 
 can't make it.  i am saving money for vegas next week. 
 how do you like that ene now?  it is very strong.  i will be in tomorrow around 2pm.  you can reach me on my cell phone at (713)825-8410.  maybe we can get together tomorrow or wednes. 
 no it is 80's club stuff. 
 we can get her a lap dance 
 i get back from denver that night around 10pm so i don't think that i can make it. 
 that place sucks.  lets go somewhere else. 
 who you taking with the second?  can't trade it can you? 
 i am going to take stephen davis. 
 boondoggle.  golf & booze.  i need to meet with some customers. 
 plove only knows the skanks over at the pink pussycat, so that is an option. the girls are not that bad if we bring some clearisil for the blemishes and a couple of cases of beer. 
 i am going to take rodell meally.  he can recover from that acl quickly. 
 your wife isn't on this list.  you don't need to lie about going there. 
 sorry shooter 
 i wont tell.  you could be sakora pine.  that is a pretty good porn name. 
 that is the best news i heard all day.  how was new orleans. 
 i am a big shooter. 
 what is your brother in law's name? 
 I have been out of town the last couple of days.  If you want to meet today that would be fine. 
 you don't like my secretary?  what is going on?  how was your party?  i was in denver. 
 i would go but i need to save money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.  i was there for work.  it was fun.  we just drank  and went golfing.  let me know what is going on tonight. 
 allegedly 
 i need rest.  i am dead. 
 nevermind.  there was a guy from louisiana at this conference who worked at reliant.  it wasn't your bro in law though. 
 i need to sleep.  i am worn out from denver.  i just went golfing and drinking in denver.  it was fun but now i am tired.  i need to save some money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.  when is your cruise? 
 i sent her a gift certificate from amazon.  should be in the mail now and it is addressed to lori.  gas did come off.  weather looks nice everywhere.  how was new years? 
 definately.  let me know when you get back and we can go.  have fun. hopefully you won't hit any hurricanes. 
 have you heard any more about vegas? 
 i leave around 6 or 7.  someone needs to send an email and let us know what is up.  do we even have hotel reservations? 
 between 8 & 9.  who all is even going on this thing now? 
 this is funny 
 not  much.  maybe golfing tomorrow.  you still going to austin? 
 that made my day 
 there is no need to redraw 
 we are not redrawing just b/c hoskins quit and the guy with the last pick wants to get a better position. 
 i won't be able to pick up griese if i don't have the first pick 
 keepin it real in 2-0-0-1 
 i think he could go to the pro bowl and start ahead of manning this year. 
 can you follow me to the car dealership at lunch tomorrow at lunch so i can drop off the tahoe to get fixed? 
 i hope you miss that tropical storm in the gulf.  cant believe that there would be any hurricanes this time of the year out there.  did you see 'the perfect storm'? 
 i don't want my car to be powdered up.  it will look like i am driving a mary kay car. 
 foward me the email from jacques. 
 i guess you owe me $50 since you haven't returned with your score.  must have been a pretty high score.  you can pay me whenever or get my money to shirley. 
 that girl jennifer the secretary works up here now.  should i put in a good word for you? 
 what did you do on new years?  sorry i didn't come.  i didn't feel good and i didn't feel like driving 10 hours for a short weekend.  i was glad sunday i wasn't on the road b/c i felt like shit.  did you see lsu? 
 the web page will have everything 
 i think you must have set a record or something on it.  if you would have passed easily i am sure i would have heard from you earlier.  i think you scored around a 200 or something.  don't be a welch.  just admit you lost and pay your debt. 
 check the web again 
 are you looking for a job here or something? 
 use a printer and print it off 
 is that how one of your dirty stories started in that porn mag you have? 
 Here is the forecast.  Our meeting using these numbers won't be until tomorrow so they will most likely change shortly. 
 sorry to send this dumb email but i am supersticious. 
 thanks for sending that chain letter.  i am supersticious. 
 you can't send it back.  those chain letters don't work like that.  what type of car did you buy?  i cant wait to see it and take it out on the town to pick up chicks when i come home. 
 did you and mike go to maiden voyage? 
 teacher of the year 
 i won't be able to play friday.  i leave at 530pm.  i will check on job stuff today.  i will probably need you to email your resume to me when you get a chance. 
 oohh la la.  who was your "friend"?  did you guys read those stories together?  i am good.  i am ready for vegas baby!  it is going to be epic. 
 don't mess with married men.  that is bad karma. 
 i gave her a thrill. 
 two married guys? 
 are you looking to get in to i.t. again or more of a commercial role? 
 home wrecker. 
 send me your resume and i will get it to some people in both groups.  call me tonight and we can discuss this. 
 friday.  i am gonna pick me up a call girl and act out dirty fantasies all weekend.  i want to be dressed in diapers and spanked like a bad boy.  i want to have my diapers changed.  how much do you think all that would cost? 
 i got your email address.  hope you had a great new years.  love matt 
 it won't really go through him b/c he doesn't do the hiring. 
 when i am married i want a girlfriend 
 aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!  them is jus jokes 
 i was thinking a little younger 
 dem is jus jokes 
 i have a trade for you that will give you one more pick.  you give me your 2nd round pick and i will give you my 3rd rd & 6th rd picks.  two for one-zies.  let me know what you think. 
 the best moment of your life 
 cool.  i will be home by 8 tonight 
 do you want to make a trade for your 2nd rd pick? 
 mom said you weren't feeling well.  i just wanted to send you an email to see how you are doing.  i hope you feel better.  hopefully you will be able to make it to denver.  this should make you feel better, i am still terrible at golf.  i shot a 100 the other day, so i think you can still take me.  i will be in vegas this weekend for a bachelor party but i will try to call next week. 
 we just got that center wilkerson.  he is the best lineman in the country. 
 keep me up to date on his condition.  i will be in vegas this weekend so if anything happens please let me know.  you can reach me on my cell phone at 713-8258410.  your car sounds great.  see you soon. 
 don't deny it. 
 i was thinking that i give you a 3rd and 4th for your 2nd 
 those are pretty funny.  i am going to vegas this weekend.  i will play some slots for you. 
 i will play 
 does that get you through the night?  thinking of the passion and heat you felt in the cold & frigid air in colorado. 
 here is something to be proud of.  i can put this on a resume.  tom, you can say you lived it. 
 i haven't written all day.  sorry.  i usually just wait for you to write and then reply. 
 I will give you my 2nd, 5th, 8th  for your 2nd & 6th 
 you just slipped and fell b/c you were in such a hurry b/c your were so excited 
 i need to pick up my jacket tonight.  will you be there around 7? 
 i am going to vegas.  you always bring sex up anyway.  plus that is all we know of eachother. 
 vegas baby!  i spoke with jacques the other night.  he is going to leave a message with me at the desk.  so i will leave one there with you.  we are at harrah's accross from ceasars and mirage.  better have your game face on dog. 
 the theme for the weekend is " can til i can't" - drink from when i can see til i can't. 
 in 
 you fear it 
 let me think about it.  i am deep at wr.  show me a bid for griese and maybe something can be worked out. 
 do i have enough time to grow a mullet? 
 what about extensions or a weave?  do you think those would look natural? tell me what i should wear. 
 no thanks 
 vegas was fun.  i am tired.  i had to go to portland afterwards. 
 great.  he can go there with all the talent in the world and get run by the pac-10. 
 ah no thanks 
 i am in on this 
 i am emailing about the football pool.  bryan hull told me to give you an email and you could sign me up.  just let me know what i need to do.  matt lenhart 
 griese for duece 
 did you go on your vacation yet?  i hope you are not on it now b/c there is a huge hurricane heading into the gulf.  you could end up like gilligan. 
 are you guys going on a date or something 
 i will tell him i am your pimp 
 woman dont ya know i'll kill ya 
 i will take that bet. 
 i don't have hbo 
 you should thow a rager.  congrats 
 i hope i have a girlfriend after i get married.  that would be nice. 
 did i say something wrong? 
 which age comment?  the one when i said that you were too old to be my girlfriend after i get married? 
 yeah baby i am in town this weekend.  i called the h.r. woman and she hasn't called back.  i am gonna email her your resume.  it looked good. 
 hey, cheer up pumpkin.  you aren't thirty yet so don't worry about it. 
 um, why do your knees hurt?  have you been bad? 
 i am always good.  i know the secret.  but i haven't put my good secret to use lately. 
 she was on howard stern and some 18 year old won a prom date with heard and lost his v-card.  she kind of dated him for a bit.  nice girl. 
 you make them.  i just don't think they will win the next two nat'l champ. 
 give me edgerrin 
 i was about to accept that. 
 well compared to chad i get more action than a porn star.  the secret is a secret.  i can't let it out.  you saw that seinfeld. 
 Harry-  I just offered up a trade to you.  Take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think. 
 where are you with your family?  i went to vegas and lost money.  watch out for that  hurricane.  if it strenthens think of me b/c i will be happy b/c that will mean that gas prices increase.  we will go out and party when you get back. 
 yeah.  uh thanks for calling  at 1:30.   you sounded mollered.  where did you go?  who did you go out with? 
 make some changes and i will send it to her today.  she didn't get back to me but i will call her again today.  i might go tonight.  what time is it tonight. 
 just send it to me from home tonight and i will get it to the lady tomorrow. let me know if you go tonight and i might tag along. 
 are you going to try to be an investment banker on wall street?  that would be cool.  i could visit & try to meet some models that i might want to marry. 
 i mean big 12.  i don't think they will win the next two nat'l championships.  texas definately won't. 
 i wish i lived the life of a rock star.  that would be good.  actually life is good.  work is going well.  do you feel better?  hopefully we can get out to phoenix over thanksgiving again so you can beat the tar out of me at golf.  here is my analogy of you & me at golf:  you are tiger woods on sunday and i am greg norman at the masters on sunday.  i will try to call this weekend.  love matt 
 you are in nyc?  no your not.  don't set me up with the dirty talker, i am afraid she would embarass me. 
 i hope it becomes a hurricane too.  huricanne = $$$$ for me.  call me when you get back from your 3 week vacation.  it must be really hard over there at deloit. 
 are you really in nyc? 
 you lucked out.  there isn't a hurricane. 
 i probably will party tomorrow b/c it is going to be the best day of work ever.  i actually kind of interviewed at csfb in nyc.  that would be huge if you got a job with them.  i know two guys that work there.   if you are in banking you better get used to 80-100 hours a week.  talk to you later holmes. 
 we cant go get drinks if you are in a body cast.  that would look to crazy. i would be trying to pour a margarita down the opening for your mouth.  i am glad the weather is good.  it really doesn't matter too much about the hurricane.  call me when you get back. 
 lucky fuck 
 i went to woody's last night.  there was such a hottie coming in when i was leaving and i would have stayed but today was such a big day at work i couldn' t be exhausted and hung over.  she could have been my wife.  i love woody's when it is warm.  ken's email is kenneth.shullklapper@enron.com 
 i meant the big 12.  i don't think that they will win the next two. 
 Toni-  Here is the resume I left you a message about.  Get back to me when you get a chance.  Thank you,  Matt Lenhart 
 i told her that you were interested in her 
 sure.  maybe. 
 put it in the paper dog 
 marquis.  i like volcanoes better.  good day at work? 
 what does sp mean? 
 you must be on this "best conference" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that smoked you guys in dallas. 
 just open an account at www.wsex.com 
 this is a league where you pick all 16 games on the spread each week and if you get the most games correct you win $$.  it is only 50 
 looks like the flight will depart,  but they cannot give me info until tomorrow.  the flights today are taking off.  i arrive at 8:55. 
 i get in thurs night.  we can go out either fri or sat or both. 
 this guy is a regular carl lewis 
 i see your brother in law doing some trades on line with us 
 8-3.  tenn.  sucks.  we roll them. 
 i leave for denver on thurs. 
 lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou. good luck. 
 i heard you were anyway 
 we can get drinks wed if you would like. let me know when a good time is. 
 i get back monday night.  we can get a drink next week.  that actually works out better for me anyway.  what are you doing this weekend. 
 i haven't found out about my test yet.  i am pretty sure i failed.  i didn't study enough. 
 i called her and she still isn't there.  i wonder if she still has a job here. 
 she still works here.  she is probably on vacation or something.  i am sure she will get right back to daddy when she gets in town.  she sounds hot. 
 i am going to denver.  i will be ready for it next week. 
 i am going to denver tomorrow.  i am excited to get home for a couple of days.  how did you know i went to the black swan?  i saw some girl who was at that wedding we went to and she lives in your apt. complex. 
 i had manning but i traded him away b/c i had no backs.  now i have vodka collins starting for me. 
 did you talk to max?  what night should we go out?  if we only go out 1 night i vote sat.  if we go out both that is cool too.  what time is cu/csu? 
 i am going to go out.  give me a call at home or on my cell. 
 csu is the underdog and i would bet that they get punished.  tell max to stay out of the ghetto.  property there doesn't appreciate. 
 thanks for the email.  i am hopefully taking off tomorrow night, but i am not sure b/c  i am flying united.  it will be good to be home for a few days. vegas was fun.  i went for a bachelor party.  some of my friends are starting to fall.  i hope billie's mom is okay.  i will talk to you soon.  love matt 
 what the fuck are the highlands 
 isn't that where the vatos live 
 i have that work trip on oct. 21st.  is there another weekend that you could come to n.o.? 
 disregard my last email.  we might not be going on that weekend. 
 i called united and it sounds like my flight will fly.  see you tonight. 
 i can go that weekend. 
 is that your babe 
 we couldn't get in.  the line wasn't moving so we went to the hub.  i tried to call your cell phone and leave a message.  i got your message late last night about the movie.  my cell phone was upstairs and i couldn't hear it ringing.  how was mercury room? 
 nothing more sexy than a girl that can dance 
 what is going on?  i don't think we need your tickets.  if you want me to try to sell them there i will.  how was labor day weekend for you?  what did you do? 
 can you foward me the rules for that loser league? 
 can you send down your rockies forecast again?  i need to look at your numbers for the winter again.  thanks  matt 
 that game was great.  i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole office.  the defense is a major concern.  i am torn between being impressed with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out b/c of that defense.  st. louis had a good defense last year.  i hope their defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense.
