 congrats.  that is good news.  what else is going on. 
 did you like the blond with the white sweater? 
 shawn is in town tonight and wants to get a bite to eat if you are up for it. 
 i will let you know.  i need to run after work. 
 email me back or just give me a call tonight. 
 what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was dc?  i heard that place is a blast. 
 ok.  i will take it. 
 are you guys using all your tickets?  i can buy one today if you guys are using yours.  probably a good idea for me to buy it anyway.  i think that i am going in sat morning. 
 yeah bra 
 i got a ticket.  fucking girlfriends.  girls hate football. 
 you're already in love. 
 are your boys ready to get rolled sat. night? 
 are you going in town for the lsu game this weekend? 
 i heard dc is fun.  i don't care what we do.  we were talking about going to boone's sat and hang out on his porch and drink before we go out.  i think he has a patio in his backyard. 
 greatest email ever 
 we are going in saturday.  thanksgiving was great.  i played golf all weekend.  how was yours.  i really appreciate you sending that resume on.  did you get this reply earlier?  my cpu keeps blowing up. 
 what is it.  i got to know.  i need some new chicks.  i need the weekend.  today totally sucks.  what are some good books to read? 
 no, but i saw that they won tonight.  it was close.  is sakic going to be ok? 
 i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next morning when you both woke up. 
 ditto.  work is it.  i am going to vegas this weekend, so i got that going for me. 
 i bought my ticket.  i arrive on that saturday @ 12:20pm.  i will email grandma. 
 hey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  love matt 
 what is grandma's email address? 
 i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.  love matt 
 i hope this isn't a pic of a naked old man again.  what has been going on?  i haven't heard from you in a while. 
 you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something this week. 
 did they look good or lucky to win?  how is roy playing? 
 you said the line worked well and when i first started reading that i was like "hey now!".  you never know.  you could be a wild woman on vacation if you never have to see those people again. 
 why would you shoot yourself?  chicks go home with guys all the time. 
 that is good 
 why not?  you don't like those things?  you get penis straws and everything. 
 how was your wedding? 
 i went to val's wedding.  it was a blast.  how did a wedding get busted by the cops?  what type of people went to this thing? 
 next week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to waste a saturday moving. 
 this is still my email.  what is going on?  how is your business doing? 
 i think i met a few of your friends that night, but i don't remember who is who.  it seems like such a long time ago. any time is good for me next week.  let's get together on tuesday?  let me know if that is good for you. 
 nice.  i knew that would be a better choice.  saturday night is on dog.  we are going to golf sat also if you are in.  let me know.  tee time is at 11. 
 745 sucks.  we will hit it sat night. 
 that was a mistake.  i don't know what i was thinking.  i need to stay home. 
 i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will try to call you and grandma this weekend.  matt 
 i am going with work.  another boondoggle. 
 he went home already.  we went to dinner mon & tues.  i am just going to chill this week and party on saturday, maybe even friday a little.  are you going out tomorrow? 
 enron would probably do something like this, but i think you need to contact that charity group.  they might already have a team.  it is good to see that you are such a philanthropist. 
 you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee? 
 i have a tee time for sat @ 11.  let me know if you think you can play today.  the course is sienna plantation. 
 saturday is definately on.  fri i am up for whatever.  maybe happy hour and turn in before 2am for once. 
 Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect New Orleans Saints team. The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.  He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.  Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one corner of the screen, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away --ka-boom!  "I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans and teaches him the great game of football, and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.  The young Bosnian is "canonized" as the Great Hero of football, and when Haslett asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl." "I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says. "You deserted us.  You are not my son." "I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads. "I just won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No, let me tell you," the mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday, and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight." The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says " ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to New Orleans."

 he is a winner.  kansas might turn into a 6 win a year program with cooper there. 
 yeah.  i think they will go to the rose bowl. 
 i am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned good time.  it is a good stress relief. 
 the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot. 
 rohan davey 
 you better be able to golf tomorrow. 
 you obviously haven't seen my new swing.  you need to be on your best game to take my title. 
 totally 
 nope 
 i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 2 hours 
 all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at front porch also SUSAN! 
 especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter 
  susan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.   susan said: why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself. 
 i am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room. 
 what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say " i am a trader at enron" 
 i think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night.  we will know for next weekend. 
 what is up with the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again? 
 how was moving this weekend?  did you still want to get a drink after work tomorrow? 
 this is their last hope 
 how was happy hour?  i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the message until late. 
 if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team 
 they have to be worried about you in ebs if you come in to work hung over on mondays 
 it is a good work out for you to move up 3 flights of stairs.  did you move it all yourself or pay someone to do it?   mi luna is good for me tomorrow.  i love their ritas.  how about we go around 7.  i can pick you up or just meet you there if you are going straight from work. 
 just b/c i am saving myself doesn't mean you need to attack me. 
 6:30 is fine with me.  i will meet you at the bar. 
 have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet?   i heard the comfort suites is where everyone is staying.  let me know if you guys just want to load everyone up in one room like back in high school. 
 comfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself. 
 i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store around the corner from my house. 
 that actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7.  that is the place in the village correct? 
 i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon" 
 i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each.  jen knows the details, but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week. 
 7:30 is good. 
 let me know what is up after you speak with her 
 did you call my cell last night? 
 he is a mo 
 i don't have it, but shoot him an email and he will give you a call. 
 i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites.  it would be $200/each for the whole week if 4 were in a room.  a condo would most likely be more expensive. 
 jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party. 
 we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.16. 
 hell yeah dog!  they betta be ready to get up on deez nuts. 
 did you take his v-card?  i don't think i ever dated one.  i like my women fast. 
 oy vey 
 i was going to talk about all the dope he used to do and how he used to wear make up in middle school.

 thanks for the thank you note  asshole 
 i heard there are a lot of hot cougars at changs 
 remember that shirley sent this to me.  it is funny but gross. 
 how was hawaii dog?  did you leave the room? 
 are you guys going to send something special?  how about some stripper's pa= nties from the bachelor party?  any news on caymen rooms? 
 why are you staying with her parents?  won't that kill some of your fun?  how good was the deal? 
 you partied it up at jazz fest?  i still have never been.  who did you go there with? 
 yeah i will be in town this weekend.  i have something to go to fri but i will definately be out on saturday.  what are you doing? 
 i think she is one of jen's cougar friends.  that is such a chick thing to do. 
 read the bottom of the email with some chicks idea as a gift 
 i am sure that girl courtney walker would like to share some special memories also 
 sure.  you buy something and let me know how much i owe 
 so i got us a hotel room in caymen.  it can sleep up to six and it is $880 for the three nights.  if all 5 of us stay there that is 176/ea.  we have it for thurs-sat night. 
 jen's dad better buy a bunch of booze.  and the schrutt's better take us somewhere nice for the rehersal dinner.  and jen's friends better put out. 
 what is the date of the party 
 i tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look?  st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time. 
 oh yeah.  he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.  what are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?  if you need entertainment i might be for hire.  i would totally give those chicks a thrill. 
 what  time is golf for? 
 does anyone have a picture of max when he used to walk around and flex his pecs? 
 i will be there 
 that does sound gay 
 season over 
 i am ready to take some more of your money out there 
 he is there best player 
 oops 
 if i could get a guaranteed contract plus tips i would skip the trip.  remember how great my legs would look dancing all over the chicks. 
 i have to go to a dinner tonight, but i will meet up with you guys at the grasshopper if you want.  we need to check that joint out.  call me on my cell and we will hit it. 
 didn't you go to grasshopper last night 
 was it any good 
 let's meet up at grasshopper 
 i thought that you said you were sharing a suite with them.  thanks for the pics. 
 i would but i am going to the spa 
 whatever gillette.  i will be feeling all loose and relaxed while i am whooping it up at the grasshopper tonight. 
 everyone who is anyone will be there. 
 i will be the prettiest at the grasshopper 
 meeting up with boone and luis and whoever.  if the broker goes we will just get some free drinks.  date went well.  i had a good time. 
 did you just get that reply? 
 are you going out this weekend?  i think you said you had a wedding to go to or something?     were you hurting on wednes morning? 
 i thought that you were going 
 yeah baby!   that place is gonna rock 
 i don't know.  i am going to golf sunday morning at the woodlands which is very nice.  i don't want to be real hung over, but i still might go out.  tonight i am definately going out. 
 i felt fine.  i woke up at 5am to work out.  i guess you are just a candy ass.  just kidding.  i have a dinner to go to tonight with some broker then i am heading downtown.  i will give you a call this weekend.  have fun at the wedding. 
 i tried to call yesterday, but you guys were not home.  i did speak with grandma and grandpa.  grandpa sounded really bad.  i am a little worried after speaking with him.  he sounded to tired to even speak.  i think i need to get out to phoenix to see them soon. 
 give me a call from dc when you get a chance.  love matt 
 i felt like a champ on sat 
 i didn't do all those shots with boone 
 Derek-  Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
 we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
 did you call for me at work today? 
 did you call me today at work 
 how was your wedding on saturday? 
 i can't remember if i sent these to you guys or not    >"You Were an Accident!" > > > > > >"Strangers Have the Best Candy" > > > > > >"The Little Sissy Who Snitched" > > > > > >"Some Kittens Can Fly!" > > > > > >"Getting More Chocolate on Your Face" > > > > > >"Where Would You Like to Be Buried?" > > > > > >"Kathy Was So Bad Her Mom Stopped Loving Her" > > > > > >"The Attention Deficit Disorder Association's Book of Wild Animals of > > >North Amer...

 i wasn't that drunk on saturday.  i was just joking.  i felt great on saturday.  like a champ.  people get married younger than you?  wow.  what the hell do they do if they get married that early? 
 i had to wake up early on sunday so i didnt feel like going.  were there a lot of hotties? 
 i will be here on fri night, but sat i am going to tim's engagement party.  i think i will be out on fri. 
 i am here dog 
 yeah, paincourtville, la.  i don't know where the fuck that is. 
 i will be watching.  have fun 
 test 
 when are you riding into baton rouge?  sat or fri? 
 1400 smith st. houston, tx 77002-7361 
 did chad hit you up to live with him? 
 if you leave on sat i will ride with you guys 
 i thought that was your area code.  kind of freaked me out.  you can be a little crazy sometimes.  just kidding.  don't mess with texas is good.  it is about to get really hot here.  we reserved a room at comfort suites.  i think that is where everyone is staying in the caymens?  i am looking foward to it.  should be a blast.  when is the bachelorette party?  what are you guys going to do? 
 i just looked at the prices for flights to cayman and they run around $600.  this is going to cost over $1000.  start saving now. 
 i knew you would bag me again!  if you have to work there is nothing you can do about that.  i am going to baton rouge on saturday for an engagement party.  i will probably go out on friday.  when do you get back from chicago?  give me a call and maybe we can do something next week. 
 i heard they might move the wedding to miami 
 i am up for it.  should be a good weekend to live it up. 
 memorial weekend = booze + golf + sluts 
 i think miami would be more fun than cayman.  cayman is really laid back.  miami = hot sluts 
 i don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said.  i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not.  don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it.  i think miami would be a lot more fun. 
 she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each.    miami will rock. 
 does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either place will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life. 
 i just want to meet some models down there.  i don't hang out at discos thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.  i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis. 
 i think i will wear a suit with a t-shirt like sonny crocket 
 merlin can be captain castillo 
 mini me 
 or the peck from the movie willow 
 are you and celeste going to br on fri or sat 
 nice 
 "how they met" brought tears to my eyes 
 does this have nudity? 
 what time do you want to leave tomorrow?  around noon? 
 TOTALLY 
 i have to hold off until vegas.  my liver is sore from this past weekend.  i have to go home and nurse it at night. 
 this weekend i had to go to baton rouge for an engagement party.  i am going to stay in town this weekend.  i might try to go tubing or something like that.  what did you do this weekend?  are you in town for memorial day? 
 i am not dating her.  i only went out with her a few times.  i doubt we will go out again.  how about you?  have you been dating a lot lately? 
 sure.  we can probably get out there and play at 3. 
 do you think the avs will close out the blues tonight?  they haven't looked too good the last two games. 
 i am not that picky.  she is nice it just didn't work out well.  we had fun  it just hasnt took off.  one of those deals. 
 is it still snowing? 
 what did you do this weekend?  i gave you a shout on fri to go out.  you didn't miss much.  we went to the grasshopper and that joint sucks.  it is really cheesy. 
 shooters.

 let me check with him and see what night would be good for him to go up.  we are golfing on fri so sat might be a better time to get up there.  i will let you know. 
 did you get chad's email?  i would rather go up next weekend.  i will go up this weekend if you are up for it, but if not i think we need a good excuse. 
 did you see the article in the journal where cali's attorney general said he wants to lock up ken lay (ene's chairman) in a prison cell with a cell mate? 
 next sat might be better.  i don't think mitch is gonna be able to make it and everyone was out of town last weekend.  let's do it next sat if you are in town. 
 i told him i didn't think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat. 
 call me again when you get a chance.  i lost your number 
 you think this weekend will be more packed than next?    let's just do it next weekend.  that way mitch and i can both head in.  tim might be able to make it then also. 
 what does that mean? 
 we might have a cook out or something on sat.  if that is the case i will let you know. 
 no thanks.  what aabout the happy hour with the hottie? 
 for easter i just stayed in town and golfed all weekend?  what did you do?  did you go to central and regulate some punks.  what are you doing this weekend?  i am going to vegas.  i haven't been home at all this month except for last weekend.  i have to go to buttfuck mississippi next weekend for a wedding. 
 i think chad is pissed we aren't going to austin.  he sent me a message that said " u snooze u lose".  what the fuck is that? 
 i said i would go next weekend. 
 yeah.  i couldn't get an opp to  talk to her. did you know her 
 the product number for pg&e topock is 47085.   the correct company name for transcanada is the division of transcanada.  thanks for your help.  matt 
 yep.  i was going to try and talk to her but she was reading and listening to a walkman.  i was sweating like a freak when i was running.  probably scared her.  it looked like i was evaporating. 
 i'm bout it 
 luis - you love heating oil 
 nevermind.  so why didn't you think that girl was the type i go for last night?  how was the game? 
 do you like the avs chances?  i think it should be an awesome series. 
 the sitara deal looks correct 
 val is getting married there.  his fiance, celeste, is from there.  mississippi is so cool. 
 i think i have montezuma's revenge 
 i have a type and she fits it.  you obviously didn't know who she was.  so is your boss going to make you take out her son? 
 she looks like she fits it 
 how is your face doing?  is the swelling going down? 
 memorial all packed up.  we can go out there and just try to get on.  hopefully around 2:30.  maybe you can get out early and get our names on. 
 you up for golf tomorrow 
 me you and val tomorrow 
 it is on espn so that won't work.  if i was you i just wouldn't go.  just hit the dinner. 
 whatever.  ride would be good. 
 i got your jacket from bass 
 i am going to hell for that one 
 yeah i know, but admit you laughed. 
 do you want to send your resume to enron again?  they are on a big kick to hire some new people.  might be worth your while just to take a look and  see how it compares. 
 i got your message but i need to work 
 my bad man.  i got your message around 930 and i went to bed after that.  let's hook up with them this weekend.  what is up for tonight?  i say we hit club no minor on sat and then uropa.  we need to tear it up some. 
 i am up for a few drinks tonight.  maybe lz's or something laid back.  i want to feel like a champ tomorrow. 
 do you guys want to hit el patio early on saturday and get some blue ritas and then head over to uropa?  that would be a good night to go tear it up completely. 
 means you got a lot of ammo 
 i booked my flight home on june 30th.  i arrive that afternoon and leave to houston on the 7th.  so have the frig packed with food and beer and be ready to golf.  looking foward to getting home.  love matt 
 lets definately play tomorrow. 
 call me later.  let's get some drinks some where laid back and try to meet some honeys.  let's go to lz or something. 
 i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night? 
 i will invite you to be my caddie.  you can carry my clubs and clean them for me.  if you do a good job i will give you a crisp $5 bill. 
 i guess i am going up there saturday.  i think i will try to take it easy on friday.  i can  definately tell that i am not 18 anymore b/c i cannot recover at all. i am also going broke going out. 
 so what did you and lisa do until 7am loverboy? 
 send your resume and i will get it to the right people. 
 nintendo doesn't count for your handicap.  how about the avs.  that was the most impressive game they have played all post season. 
 nevermind 
 sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon. 
 i think that is a scam to have you send it around 
 i remember you.  i was pretty drunk though.  hopefully i didn't make too much of an ass out of myself.  we hit it really hard that night for my buddy's birthday.  how was your bachelorette party?  are you back in austin now? 
 who sings that song "harley davidson of a bitch"?  i think you said it was elo or something. 
 i am excited to watch it.  so you got a promotion at work?  that is good news.  what is your new job going to be? 
 my friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street. 
 lets head up to austin on saturday night.  i got an email from that girl at the black swan.  she lives in austin but will be at a wedding on sat. 
 i will be in nd.  i think my plane lands 10 min. after yours.  avs got worked last night.  i don't have a good feeling about the series now.  they had no answer for the defense. 
 i think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on.  i need the  range.  just send your resume when you get a chance.  enron is looking for a ton of people. 
 i haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play? 
 i just don't know if they can ever handle that defense.  they didn't make any good adjustments in the 3rd period. 
 i forgot you had a wedding.  i don't go up to austin all that much.  i usually stay down here and go out.  where do you work up there again?  i am sure you told me, but i forgot.  where are the good places to hang out?  is it 4th st? 
 you think houston is the armpit of the world?  i love it hear.  the weather sucks in the summer, but other than that it is a blast.  so you do work for strip clubs huh?  that is interesting.  what is your stripper name? 
 i live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf.  outside of the loop is pretty ugly.  which part of houston did you grow up in? 
 i think hoskina is having a going away happy hour, but after that i am not doing anything.  i need to watch hockey. 
 your mama 
 prompt month is out there.  it is nwpl rox. 
 i went to high school in denver.  i have only lived here for 2 years.  no wonder you hate houston.  there is nothing up in north houston. 
 i went to denver east.  have you heard of it?  i haven't heard of your friends that work here.  i like working here.  it is pretty exciting on the trading floor.  are you guys going out tomorrow night after the rehersal dinner. 
 i don't remember the bet 
 i will be in town.  i have a dinner to go to at 6:30, but i am going out after that.  you should give me a call.  i think you have my cell phone number right? 
 this is correct. 
 i don't get it 
 austin tomorrow.  you in 
 i guess it didn't come through 
 this girl has clothes on 
 i am going to a broker dinner at capitol grill.  i am going to head out afterwards.  i will give you a call later. 
 you should just put 5000 on the lakers.  you wont make 5k but you will definately make $$$ 
 are you hurting this morning?  my lifestyle has to change within the next 5 years or i will be dead. 
 i arrive in fargo  at 12:20 from minneapolis on flight 1051. see you soon. 
 Stephanie-  I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it.  Thank you,  Matt Lenhart 
 oh it is going great.  so great to hear from you.  how is everything at the top of the building? 
 i know that when you get really mad at me it is only b/c you care..................so......................much 
 yeah.  i sent it in this morning. 
 what is going on?  so is the wedding in miami now?  do i need to buy some club clothes for south beach? 
 Astra Power also needs to be added to this product 
 i will send it to the right people today 
 i need to call that girl tonight.  you have got to give them a few days before you call.  i wanted to take her out thurs but the stanley cup is on.  maybe fri is better.  take your girl out then and we can meet up later for drinks. 
 thank you for your help 
 i feel like a champ today 
 i will let you know tomorrow.  i leave sat morning so fri would be perfect.  i think six days is kind of trendy so i am going 4 days. 
  this is that invite.  are you going to hit this tomorrow?  i will stop by. 
 i am with ya dog 
 i will be pissed if i can walk out of this party 
 i am definately bringing back some talent to the stabbin cabin 
 i am gonna drink like a kennedy 
 have you heard back from enron? 
 what do you think of the avs chances tonight?  don't forget your clubs. 
 i will let you out of the bet for $20 
 i am gonna drink like boone 
 your past few months have been just as bad.  at least i didn't close uropa b/c i was puking in the bathroom. 
 let's definately go next thurs.  i didn't hit it either b/c the hockey game was on.  did you get a date for tonight?  i am going out with one of those p.t.s.  let me know and maybe we can meet up. 
 i should have given you some cards to pass out to the hotties. 
 i thought you said you were gonna get that clam back to the stabbin cabin 
 no it is nice.  i shouldn't have any problems. 
 how was the weekend?  did i miss anything on saturday night for halloween? 
 give me a call 
 mack brown lost in austin to north carolina st. 
 famous vassigh quotes:  "pass the butter" "you gonna finish that?" "if loving this cake is wrong, i don't want to be right" "i can eat twice as much of this ice cream b/c it is fat free" "food in lousyana is overrated.  texas food rules" "texas biscuts rule the world" "i like my cookies texas size" "don't mess with texas banana splits" 
 i did watch a lot yesterday, but i was tired and slept most of the time. 
 i thought we would win.  they suck.  i hate football. 
 the law student was the replacement b/c the real one was such a fuck up.  sorry i didn't call you guys back last  night.  i didn't get home until 8 and the sopranos was on. 
 i don't remember half of that night, but i do remember you in the bathroom.  sierra is fun on wednesdays isn't it? 
 everyone was pissed cause we lost.  what did you do this weekend? 
 it was ok.  we went to the lsu game and lsu lost so we came home that night.  what did you do this weekend? 
 just messing with you. 
 i am not fighting with you at all.  you are just grilling me.  you are an angry person. 
 i was sober and i remember how it went down.  i said one rude thing in the car and that was it.  you were just going nuts and wouldn't let it die.  you kept flipping out on me. 
 only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you wouldn't let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just venting frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober. 
 you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who said you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.  you were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours. 
 i was being nice.  you kept starting it and then blaming it on me.  you were going nuts. 
 you were letting me have it.  i deserved some of it b/c i made some bad jokes, but overall you were pretty brutal.  i think i am heading to baton rouge for the game this weekend instead of partying for halloween. 
 you still mad at me?  you were pissed last night. 
 by the way, my abs kill from my rigorous workout yesterday. 
 call me.  i cant find your number through the operator. 
 i think i am going to go to the game. 
 actually they are not looking at us.  some of our lawyers defended revlon.  i heard it wrong. 
 i dont know but we would be the prettiest in the industry. 
 sorry i had to run last night.  so the word is now that enron has about 4 or 5 companies looking to take us over.  aol, lucent, revlon?, and a few others.  i will give you a call later. 
 who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls. 
 read this article.  it is a little dramatic. 
 i think we are now going to r&r.  boone has free passes. 
 i heard saturday, but that looks like it is the following sat.  that would work out perfect.  i am ready to tear it up. 
 who is better for the avs to play?  what has been going on in denver? 
 i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it.  what is xp? 
  this is the group throwing the party at r&r sat night.  check some of the photos at the link at the bottom.  lots of hotties. 
 i think i am going to dress up as a chippendale stripper.  i am going to oil myself up and go out in a thong. 
 i doubt it.  i want to go party afterwards and dress up for halloween.  are you going as gi joe again? 
 no.  it means i am excited to go. 
 i am gonna get wasted at this dinner. 
 i think we might go to the garden in the heights party or r&r for halloween.  we are going to watch the game first.  let me know if you hear of anything else. 
 so are we still on for dinner or what? 
 ok.  what are you guys doing for halloween?  boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r.  i guess there is some halloween thing there.  let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later. 
 i was going to go running after work and then maybe stop by.  who all was going to go? 
 should be 7.20. 
 give me a shout later.  we need to dress up and party regardless. 
 b/c i want you to understand when i am out of money, but if you owe me dinner and are out of money i cant understand. 
 there is a double standard here so i can't understand 
 you guys still going out tonight? 
 probably not.  i think you should understand my situation. 
 yeah.  i had it picked out and everything.  i had to call the dealer and tell him i am not going to suprise you with it.  we can still go to dinner tomorrow night though. 
 i like miss +10.5, iowa st, and ark 
 our stock is taking a bath. 
 my 401k is now worthless.  i have no money. 
 i definately need to throw in some shit about that and all the stripper  sluts we met in vegas.  or the hooker scott hooked up with.  that would make a good speech. 
 thanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed. 
 those brides maids are ready to party.  this hotel is right on south beach. 
 i have a room reserved.  it is $160/night.  we can split it up and pay $40 each which is cheap.  i think it is around jan 12th.  i have the room from that thurs-sat. 
 i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip? 
 enron is going to be a penny stock pretty soon.  sec is investigating now. 
 sorry i didn't get back to you last night.  i will find out who is in town.  i talked to some people and they are up for it.  we could watch lsu and then go to r&r.  they are having a pimps and prostitute party. 
 i sent it today so you should get it by thurs. 
 are you going to do  your halloween party or what?  i will start telling jill and her friends.  i think you should do it.  i will help you out with everything on it. 
 i got them.  i left you a voice mail last night.  send me your address and i will mail them today. 
 i hate notre dame.  tim, i need to get down to your office today. 
 the wedding was fun.  drank a lot during the day and i was worn out sat night after the game.  i am staying here this weekend. 
 i did. 
 let me know.  i will be up for some drinks. 
 i went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.  sorry about taking off like that.  i had a good time, but i ran out of energy quick. 
 this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10. 
 definately.  let me know. 
 should have taken the bet and given the points.  i didn't hear from you when i offered that. 
 how was this weekend?  did you get into anything? 
 i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time.  do you want to golf sat? 
 maybe i will come home the 16th of may.  let me see and i will get back to you. 
 i am definately staying in town.  i don't feel like battling that traffic. 
 i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.  we watched it and then went out in the french quarter.  i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows.  i don't think i want to drive in for the game. 
 you wish that was your problem 
 thurs night was ok.  we went to taco milagro.  that place is full of old folks now.  how was the weekend? 
 did you end up going out last night? 
 means i could be tired afterwards. 
 i might.  i need to go running or something. 
 yeah.  she is cute.  i heard she was divorced but i wasn't sure.  little young to be divorced. 
 you partying tonight? 
 she is nice.  i don't think it will lead to much.  do you know that girl paige? 
 i can't come the last week b/c of work.  that is when prices get set for next month gas.  it is a very busy week and there is no way for me to get out of it.  when are grandma and grandpa coming? 
 it was good.  had some good meetings and stuff like that.  didn't party or anything. 
 what is up?  this weekend i am going to n.o. for a wedding.  what are you up to?  did you have fun on sat?  i had a good time.  are you going out tonight?  i think we might hit up milagro. 
 lets go around 9.  i think hull is in also. 
 great.  good to hear.  i got back last night. 
 did you see the article in the wsj today on that ljm fund associated with ene? 
 who is up for milagro or something tonight? 
 did you miss me while i was gone? 
 he was just trying to run up our p/e.  some of the things these guys did was fradulent. 
 sorry i haven't called you back.  i am in portland.  i don't get back until tonight.  i will call you when i get home.  hope all is well. 
 i thought i won the tie breaker.  what happened? 
 are you on crutches 
 try his email address which is pederliefkjeseth@hotmail.com.  that is the only way i know how to get in touch with him.  i haven't booked a flight yet but i will soon. 
 i will do that. 
 not jerk, "the king" 
 the king doesn't just give gifts for no reason. 
 that is how i want you to refer to me as "the king" 
 i'm the king 
 i would have to regulate 
 you can't be cheap if you take me out.  i won't stand for it. 
 i was thinking somewhere that requires a jacket, like tony's.  someplace that is like $30 an entree. 
 i don't understand that last email 
 we can go somewhere nice.  real nice. 
 i am not letting you out of this 
 oh.  my bad.  i must have had you messed up with some other girl i made the bet with. 
 the blonde did have a hot body.  she doesn't have as pretty of a face.  tough loss last night. 
 colorado beat texas a&m.  i know you remember the bet. 
 tamu lost by 10. 
 no.  i got her number though.  i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket.  what happened to you?  i had a blast that night. 
 no i am not lying.  i flew here last night. 
 i am out of town.  i am in portland.  you can buy me dinner when we get back. 
 go florida!  they shit their pants this weekend. 
 i will be in vegas.  send her my regards. 
 i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope that helps you out. 
 watched lsu and then went to r&r.  we got pretty drunk.  you guys sounded like you were partying also.  did you have fun? 
 i saw it on the caller id the next day. 
 i saw that you guys called around 4am.  partying huh?  what were you guys doing until 4? 
 sorry i didn't make it over sat, i passed out.  how was sat? 
 yeah.  i am going to a dinner at pappas steakhouse and then going to party.  i will call you at 2am. 
 party girl 
 what are you doing tonight? 
 don't worry.  you and jen just need to be ready to party. 
 i will.  i will sleep in the middle.  sat is going to be the best day of my life. 
 i slept on the edge.  you kept tugging on the covers and tried to spoon with me.  its cool though. 
 it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don= 't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is ju= st good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the= part about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it = especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut = up nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was= real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as mazi= arz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that= i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decid= ed to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i loo= ked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at f= irst i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails p= ossibly get here?  but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had= a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he = didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured o= ut how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company w= ide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt prett= y embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to= the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now = he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wid= e email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i= know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip c= lubs. =20   MFL 
 stay at your place even though you are a bed hog 
 yep.  looks like i found the formula. 
 you are so mean.  why can't you be sweet like me? 
 just kidding.  you need to relax a little. 
 i am going to the strip club.  do you want to meet me there?  i will get you a lap dance. 
 i resent that too 
 i resent that last comment 
 i am gonna buy you a bmw 
 it is so easy b/c you get all worked up and you are not sure whether to believe me or not. 
 you have such a temper. 
 nope.  we talked a couple of times and tenatively planned to go out, but last time i called she didn't call back.  she sounded like she has a situation w/ her ex or she just
