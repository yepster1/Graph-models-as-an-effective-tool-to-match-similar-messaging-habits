 Would it help if I faxed you the 'you will have your card in 2 weeks' note they just gave me? 
 Good Morning,  I am going into a meeting at nine for I am not sure how long, so just leave a message if you have a problem or a question.  The loss schedule is per Crandall.   Cara 
 Hi,  I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you.   I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans?   Bye my special one,  Kitten

 Hi Sweetie,  I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.  I have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.  Talk to you later, have a good long weekend off. I have a new cell phone number 810-1105  Cara 
 Thanks Frank,  Hey did that intermittent blank drop down field bug in the physical path area get fixed?  I tried doing a tag a few days ago and still got that error.   Have a good day,  Cara 503/464-3814 
 Hi There,  What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.  I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.  I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.         ;) 
 Everything is wonderful......................just wonderful..............................there is a suprise on the way for you today from me.  Craig is so nice, we had a really good weekend. Thanks for inviting me to your drunken bash! 
 About another hour or so and I am outta here. I am tired..........ti..............yerd.   I ran up and bought the Charlotte Church CD, listening to it now, it is very nice.  I will bring it home with me.  I would like to come over and finish that movie tonight for a bit, but I am going HOME to sleep ;)   That ok?  C 
 Cara's new number is  503-810-1105 
 you need to contact support@oatiinc.com  They can walk you thru it.  :) 
 Have a good day  Cara 
   Y'all have a good day.  C 
 Should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?  I think it would be wise.  Also, If you want to transfer Pahio to our joint account that is fine,  I would like to have Pahio.  When you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.  Just let me know.  Thanks,  C 
 Everyone keeps asking my why I am grinning today. I thought I was playing it pretty straight............................................. 
 It's all good. 
 Dear Mom,  I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.  I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything.  Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?  Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.  503/810-1105   Love,  C 
 My boss just said "It's all good".  I laughed my ass off 
 Hey , is there any way on the face of the earth that I can get ahold of one of the remaining Drexler basketballs? 
 I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.  Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.  I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.  I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.  Cara 
 I threw the tree tag away, but I gave Lynn a bunch of bath goodies in the handle bag. 
 I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.  They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.  My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com  or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com  Thanks,  Cara 
 Please see the attached spreadsheet,   I have added leg 2 to both annuities in red.  I looked at the spreadsheet that Diana forwarded me, and probably need for you and I to sit down and just walk me thru it.   Cara 
 Hi Mom,  I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!  How is Natalie doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.  Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.   I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.   Cara 
 Hi Sweeties!  You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?  Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.  I love you and hope you all are well.  Cara 
 I haven't heard any firm plans, but I am game for nearly anywhere  maybe Perry can scare some folks up? 
 Dear Little Sister,  Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.  I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.  I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.  I love you,  Cara "Pizza Pie" 
 My dancing shoes are ON!  Woohoo!   Wanna go play before then?  If you could use a little company, I would be game for something fun to do!  C  464-3814 (work) 848-7684 (home)

 Hi Julie,  Since the stress of work is making me drink, will my liver transplant be covered by workmans comp?   :) 
 Hi,  How are you? Are you keeping busy or taking some days to decompress?  A few of us are going out to sushi tonight,  Me, Laura W, Stacy, Perry, maybe Jesse, and a few others.  We would love to have you join us.  We are thinking Koji's on 6th and broadway around 7 ish.  Please join us if you would like.   Cara  464-3814 (work) 
 nice 
 I feel like a moron 
 I tried to call, but got the 'all circuits are busy' thing a few times.   I will see you tonight at the movies with a full report!  ;)   C

 can you tell bob?  I got an undeliverable message from his e-mail address 
 she said she would get it for me after this conference call.  Are there going to be more Enron layoffs? 
 Let's meet tomorrow morning about 9 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses.  I expect it will take about 15 minutes.   Thanks,  Cara 
 Good Morning,  Due to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.  They have a wide range of experience and abilities, and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling.  Please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 3 of these folks, I would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume.  Thanks,  Cara 
 Hi,  Yesterday Richter asked me to get with John Oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use.  Although I think this is a good idea, I think that this direction should more appropriately come from you.  Please let me know what you would like me to do, if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both John and Victor, I will be happy to do so.   Thanks,  C 
 I am interested in being part of this effort if there is still room  Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor Enron North America 503/464-3814 
 Hi Frank,  Thanks for taking care of the password changes for our real time group.  Things are still very up in the air here. We hear new developments nearly on a daily basis, and so much remains unknown. I am in kind of a wait and see mode.  Thank you for asking!  Cara 
 Hi Mom,  Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.  I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.  School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  I love you!   Cara 
 I am still having lots of problems with OATI 
 I will be surrendering my cell phone when Enron no longer wishes to pay for it

 no worries,. I e-mailed julie again Just hold off for now.  I need to get my loan approved and my bonus in hand before I can move in,  I am anxious!  woohoo! 
 There are BPA real power losses for the 7th only  and some transmission only paths 
 I propose that while work is so slow we have some informal tutorials from the folks who know stuff.  SQL Access Excel Stuff (Susie is a bona-fide expert teacher!) HTML XML  Whatever folks might want to teach 
 thanks Tara 
 I can pop up today if you would like,  Just give me a call and I can dash over.   Thanks,  C 
 Hi Mom,  I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was. He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.  Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  I love you,  Cara 
 Hi Sweetie,  I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.  We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!  I love you, and Pat and Riley  Cara 
 Put vending machines in where it says COWS, and you have the filed business plan for my new company

 Good Morning,  I never got a copy of my UBS agreement, and Amy said you have been keeping them in case something happened to the FED-EX packages?  I can run up and grab it anytime.  Thanks,  Cara Freeland!  :) 
   No changes to any existing data, just adding Real Power Losses 
 Thank you for your kind words.  This is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.  Dave needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends. Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.  I am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends.  I promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.  Love,  C 
 Her mailbox must be full or something, we are getting her mail kicked back   Can we tidy up her mail a bit, she returns on Tuesday 
 I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.  Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.  I told them and they did it on the spot.  They also referred me to this website  www.americanexpress.com/rewards  I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience   Cara 
 Dave said he called you.  I feel awful. 
 I want each of you to get out of here for 30-45 mins, I will babysit your stuff while you are out.

 Good Morning Darling,  Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.  Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.  Thanks,  Cara Freeland! ;)

 I have re-started Enpower since the e-mail came out saying that the new version has been put into production.  I ran the attatched sheet, and the last group of deals that I was given had old deals blended with new deals.  These start on line 757.   Cara 
 Donald was trying to sort by POR AND POD,  Donald gets a repeating error of "invalid variant type conversion".

I really want him to be able to use the app locally like it was designed to be used.   Please let me know.  C 
 It happened twice 
 Please see Stacy's sheet.  Is it possible that if the "Get Now" button is pressed twice BEFORE results are given that this is done?   It might help to grey out the GET Now button when it is pressed, and have it re-light when the New Data button has been pressed?

 NICE!  HAVE A GOOD TIME 
 Arrrrrrrrrrgh 
 Hi There,  I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!  Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.  I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!  I love you,  CF 
 We need to be able to rely on the repeated running of the build route. Running a month long sheet from scratch is a huge problem for us, it forces us to do massive amounts of work over and over again.  I need you to find out why this is happening, and let me know when it is fixed.   Cara 
 Stacy just ran her build route  for December and got data with no counterparty n
