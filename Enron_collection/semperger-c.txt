 Would it help if I faxed you the 'you will have your card in 2 weeks' note they just gave me? 
 Good Morning,  I am going into a meeting at nine for I am not sure how long, so just leave a message if you have a problem or a question.  The loss schedule is per Crandall.   Cara 
 Hi,  I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you.   I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans?   Bye my special one,  Kitten

 Hi Sweetie,  I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.  I have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.  Talk to you later, have a good long weekend off. I have a new cell phone number 810-1105  Cara 
 Thanks Frank,  Hey did that intermittent blank drop down field bug in the physical path area get fixed?  I tried doing a tag a few days ago and still got that error.   Have a good day,  Cara 503/464-3814 
 Hi There,  What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.  I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.  I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.         ;) 
 Everything is wonderful......................just wonderful..............................there is a suprise on the way for you today from me.  Craig is so nice, we had a really good weekend. Thanks for inviting me to your drunken bash! 
 About another hour or so and I am outta here. I am tired..........ti..............yerd.   I ran up and bought the Charlotte Church CD, listening to it now, it is very nice.  I will bring it home with me.  I would like to come over and finish that movie tonight for a bit, but I am going HOME to sleep ;)   That ok?  C 
 Cara's new number is  503-810-1105 
 you need to contact support@oatiinc.com  They can walk you thru it.  :) 
 Have a good day  Cara 
   Y'all have a good day.  C 
 Should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?  I think it would be wise.  Also, If you want to transfer Pahio to our joint account that is fine,  I would like to have Pahio.  When you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.  Just let me know.  Thanks,  C 
 Everyone keeps asking my why I am grinning today. I thought I was playing it pretty straight............................................. 
 It's all good. 
 Dear Mom,  I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.  I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything.  Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?  Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.  503/810-1105   Love,  C 
 My boss just said "It's all good".  I laughed my ass off 
 Hey , is there any way on the face of the earth that I can get ahold of one of the remaining Drexler basketballs? 
 I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.  Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.  I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.  I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.  Cara 
 I threw the tree tag away, but I gave Lynn a bunch of bath goodies in the handle bag. 
 I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.  They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.  My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com  or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com  Thanks,  Cara 
 Please see the attached spreadsheet,   I have added leg 2 to both annuities in red.  I looked at the spreadsheet that Diana forwarded me, and probably need for you and I to sit down and just walk me thru it.   Cara 
 Hi Mom,  I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!  How is Natalie doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.  Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.   I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.   Cara 
 Hi Sweeties!  You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?  Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.  I love you and hope you all are well.  Cara 
 I haven't heard any firm plans, but I am game for nearly anywhere  maybe Perry can scare some folks up? 
 Dear Little Sister,  Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my
