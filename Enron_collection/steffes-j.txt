 Angela -  The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).  Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.  Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.  Jim 
 For the Monthly Update. 
 On coalitions, I was thinking about other market participants.  Agreed that= Cinergy could be the vehicle.  Also, maybe make an informal presentation t= o FERC before any filing, etc.  Jim 
 FYI.  These bills are currently moving through the California Legislature.  Not sure if the bills will be signed into law.  Please call with any questions.  From my quick glance, only good news is that it appears that the Windfall Profits Tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment.  Jim 
 Bryan -  Pls include on the Monthly update.  Jim 
 ???? 
 Lisa --  Rick Shapiro has offered to present.  I think that we can work up some presentation for 45 minutes.  Let's discuss soon the details. It is on his calendar.  Jim 
 The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.  There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.  Please call with any questions.  Jim 
 Fine.  Jim 
 Michele & Rick --  Please see the note below.  It is critical for you to call your clients (Ja= ck in the Box/Burger King and Wendy's) to try and convince them to push the= ir industry lobbyist to ask for a change in the date.  Call me at 713-853-7673 or 713-851-2499 (cell) to discuss. =20  Thanks,  Jim 
 I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.  Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).  I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.  My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work through AReM.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Christi --  I am comfortable with trying to settle.  I hate that this new Commission has to litigate this case.  It is important, however, that we focus FERC staff on the broader policy changes necessary throughout the industry and not just on Entergy's tariff.  Jim 
 I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?  I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.  Jim 
 Rick --  Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?  I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?  Appreciate your thoughts?  Jim   Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments. ``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the wholesale unit, government affairs. Anything that affects Enron,'' Lay said. 
 Hi Sweetie --  Out here in California.  Trying to rally support for competition.  Hope you and Grace are having a good day.  I love you,  Jim 
 Thanks.  Jim 
 David --  Here is some info the Windfall Profits.  Jennifer can keep you updated.  Jim 
 Please review first section.  Jim 
 thanks. 
 no. =20 
 Please include Becky Cantrell in this meeting.  Jim 
 Your call. 
  FYI 
 I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.  This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key "potential" customer.  Jim 
 FYI 
 When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 12:00 PM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Can you make this phone call?  Susan is on vacation. 
 When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 2:00 PM-3:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  I'll be on the call.  You guys are of course welcome.  My thought is that we need to push EPSA to do something on this.  Jim 
 I will be attending.  I'll cover.  Jim 
 They are active throughout the West - mainly California.  We can use them.  Both are good.  Jim 
 Kevin --  Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.  If Sue or Jeff know of later $ figures, please advise Kevin.  Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.  They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.  Jim 
  Let's set up the meetings.  Don't you think?  Jim 
 thanks for sending this out.  Jim 
 I haven't processed a bill. 
 FYI. 
 Thanks for getting the info to Keeney.  Jim 
 I don't know if we need to do anything.  Seems like they are just acquiring= the MAIN facilities, not market design material.  Have you spoken to anyon= e at ARTO to inquire?  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Linda --  Have you heard anything from DOE on this??  Jim 
 It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.  It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under Bill Bradford) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under Evan Hughes) for retail.  I spoke with Evan Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.  He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr Ibrahim.  Thanks. 
 Marcus N. says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning.  Sam Behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 203 filing and everything else is in place.  Steve Montovano has/is confirming that in PA, OH, and NJ there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters.  We probably want to put in place an update to Clinton's MBR that would allow for A/S trading.  Should we just have Sam do that work??  Jim 
 Tom --  I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).  Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."  The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.  The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).  My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??  Jim 
 =20 
 Fine.  People are shocked.  Jim 
 Linda --  Can you also please process Jose's documents?  Jim 
 FYI.  Do we need to communicate this to the trading / logistics groups?  Jim 
 Gloria --  I wanted to make sure that our License in TX allows us to use e-signatures?  EES is opening a pilot.  Jim 
 Marcus --  I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.  It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a "clean up" filing to be ready to go upon any action.  Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.  Jim 
 Here are some thoughts from me.  Jim 
 Lara --  I would think that Alan Comnes would be good (if he can make it) to go.  Jim 
 FYI.  Who are they hiring as lobbyists?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Scott --  Good to hear you were ok.  Let us know if you need anything.  I'm stuck in DC right now and trying to get home.  Jim 
 Leslie --  It's my understanding that Janine is just reviewing the Eastern US.  If I'm wrong, Janine please correct me.  Thanks 
 Let's sit down at 5pm to discuss.  Jim 
 Maggie --  You may want to attend - Global Markets?  Jim 
 Amr --  Not for us to contact the ISOs about our Material change.  Jim 
 Great job!!!! 
 FYI. 
 Thanks.  Appreciate the quick response.  Jim 
 How about 10am Tuesday?? 
 FYI. 
 ok. 
 Leslie --  Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?  Jim 
 Great. 
 let's discuss at 5pm 
 I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do). 
 I'd say 6 pm at Daily Review or Marks.  What does everyone think?  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Guillermo --  Looks good to me.  I'll discuss with Amr to ensure his agreement.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Having this e-mail on the agenda for the upcoming meeting is very helpful.  Jim 
 Sue --  My thoughts on the filing.  1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate. 2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct? 3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  Thanks,  Jim 
 The PPO - Power Purchase Option - is a unique program based on the IL restructuring law.  Texas has no analogous service.  I agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.  It's important to keep consistent messages.  Jim 
 Thanks for our new model.  Pls let me know how it is going.  Jim 
 Lisa --  I appreciate your note greatly.  While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.  Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.  Best of luck in your future plans.  I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.  Take care,  Jim 
 I agree that we are losing money.  That's not the reason for getting out of this case.  What is the upside?  Even if we win, we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time.  Is this really the best strategy?  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts.  I have to be honest, I'm struggling with the Transco / RTO split.  Jim 
 Luiz --  I don't think that I'll send this given the current direction of the PUC to move forward with TX.  I do think that these points are important and maybe Jean R. can get them in verbally as appropriate.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Janine -  Ok for you to cover the whole country.  I had forgotten our discussions.  Please discuss NM and AZ with Leslie Lawner.  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:  1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.  2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?  3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.  5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.  6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?  Jim 
 I spoke with Ashley yesterday.  Awaiting NG's filing.  No plans right now.  Will keep you in the loop.  Jim 
 FYI 
 I probably shouldn't be so serious, but I think the current situation at Enron has made me less fun.  Jim 
 The $$# is 530MM 
 Yes.  I had called him to set up a meeting.  We talked recently in PA when he told me he was taking the job.  I'll arrange lunch (if everyone wants to) soon.  But don't delay talking with him.  He wants as much help from Enron as possible.  Jim 
 Rick --  We do have an on-going dispute with the PAPUC about our assessment for gas sales.  The charge is $150k.  We are suing with others the PAPUC to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed.  Jim 
 Trying to run down the information.  Jim 
 Howard --  Did we deal with the EES letter from NYISO MMU?  Pls let me know.  Jim 
 FYI.  Not sure if we can afford this, but if you think it's helpful let's talk.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info guys.  Jim 
 Resend 
 Do we need to file on the NOPR on Partial Day Recalls??  Will EPSA file?  What position will they take?  Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position?  Jim 
 Got it.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Was the amendment approved by FERC?  Jim 
 FYI.  Will you attend the meeting at FERC?  Jim 
 Fine.  Why not have this as the first element of EISB Wholesale Quadrant??  Jim 
 Ray --  Have you looked at the testimony?  It appears to be hitting the key points.  Is there anything else that we need to be doing to make sure that our case is as strong as possible?  Give me a call.  Jim 
 Not sure.  Probably won't be ready until end of year.  Jim 
 Attached is a summary of the SCE meeting to discuss our Negative CTC claim.  Call if you would like any additional information.  Jim 
 Marchris --  Pls provide John with any further information.  Jim 
 If we do take over this type of role, what issues and information would the NYISO be entitled to?  We are pushing DG and load curtailment very actively.  Jim 
 Melinda --  Let's talk soon.  I want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision.  Jim 
 Alberto --  Pls ask Sue Mara where these stand.  I thought that the FERC didn't approve.  Jim 
 Pls send asap the information to have me submit to Rick.  Thx,  Jim 
 Good to hear from you!!!!  I hope all of your family is well. I was in DC o= n Tuesday am and drove in last night. =20  Jim 
 Rick --  Andy is looking for about $1500 for tuition reimbursement.  I would, if we can afford it, pay this.  I indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful.  Thoughts?  Jim 
 Sounds good.  Maybe we can employ the Gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a "workable" solution --  let's just decide what that is (maybe some bare minimums on RTOs)?  Jim 
 Look at this web site  www.southerncompany.com  Go to the section "NEWS & ISSUES" section of the web site.  They compute the cost of moving an electron from New Orleans to NYC.  Jim 
 Rick --  Are you going to put out the new org chart by this Friday?  Jim 
 Howard --  How did this mistake happen?  Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices?  Does this cost the desk $$?  Maybe the NYISO shouldn't be doing this?  Jim 
 Harry -  This is the meeting.  Jim 
 The TX MONTHLY story.  Jim 
 We should inform FERC Enforcement.  No formal filings.  Jim 
  Bill --  Joe Hartsoe (Fed Reg Affairs) got cc: on the demand letter from PJM.  I assume you have the letter.  If not, please let me know - Joe sent me a copy.  Jim 
 I'd say $395 is fair.  Jim 
 No known timeline yet.  I'm still discussing internally.  Jim 
 I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks.  Jim 
 We are pulling this together and will talk with Marcus Nettleson as appropriate.  Jim 
 I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program= for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely track= s the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational = signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load respons= e needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a = DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.  By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We shou= ld make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.  Jim 
 Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??  Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?  Jim 
 I am beginning to agree with Dave on Governance - that a for-profit TransCo may not be in our best interest.  Let's talk about how to change the wording.  Jim 
 Wanda --  Can you break out for me the ISO and PX money due?  I need to make sure that our Settlement is consistent with our FERC Refund issues?  Jim 
 I can attend.  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Ok.  But let's keep the time and $ minimal.  Jim 
 FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.  Not s= ure why this is even in the Settlement except to ensure that IURC won't int= ervene at FERC.  We should not sign based on this information.  Jim 
 Yes 
 We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year (see #2 below).  Let me know if there are any issues.  Jim 
 Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts??  Do they know not to do anything going forward?  Jim 
 Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).  Jim 
 After the PHC today, we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for.  Sue, can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps.  Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 Thanks.  If the May 2002 date starts to slip, pls let me know.  Jim 
 Let's discuss this afternoon.  Jim 
 Rick called Lynne Church to discuss maybe having EPSA put out daily "papers" on market issues.  EPSA did this at the FERC RTO Week and it worked very well.  Jim 
 John --  Thanks for the update.  As long as the FERC is fully in control and the ERO is not a "self-regulating" organization, I assume we'd be ok.  The ERO must be fully under the control of FERC.  Jim 
 I didn't say that was ok.  She was to move on Nov 15.  Jim 
 Help as much as you need to.  Jim 
 Harry, Janine, & Bob --  Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).  He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the Simon Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.  Thanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.  Jim 
 Joe --  I forwarded the call from Phil to Bill Bradford and let Kevin Presto know.  If you hear anything else, pls let me know.  Jim 
 Thanks.  I don't think that I want to travel to Europe right now.  Market opportunities are slowing down.  I think that we'll go to Mom's for some time.  You can always come over through the weekend to see Gracie.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for the update - I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Jim 
 ok. 
 I think that Christi's write up is great.  I've only changed two things.  If anyone has any more changes, please get to Janel ASAP.  Jim 
 Pls let me know.  Jim 
 Sue --  Please work with Diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven= or simply an internal process of SCE.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks for asking.  This is a very strange place.  Our core trading is doing very well.  It appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the Corporate level without any risk management.  I'm doing very well.  Marianna is expecting our 2nd child next May.  Grace continues to grow and become a little person.  Hope you and your family is doing well.  Jim 
 I didn't know that I was all powerful.... 
 Barbara --  Any decision on the payment?  Jim 
 Just to keep you in the loop on SCE negotiations.  Jim 
 Who will attend and present?  Jim 
 Should we work through AReM?  Jim 
 Amr --  Can we use cash as collateral for PJM??  Jim 
 Can you please add this to the general write-up for each ISO?  Thanks 
 Pls print and have for my NARUC phone call.  Jim 
 Can we move it to 3pm?? 
 FYI 
 thanks 
 Mike --  Ashley Brown called to discuss a meeting with the Stakeholders in Columbus, OH on either Dec 4 or Dec 5.  He would like our participation.  Also, he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties.  Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.  Jim 
  Interesting ideas on Reliant and Orion asset transfer.  Jim 
 In our discussion of the Duke model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?  Would the Duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.  Maybe make this point stronger.  Jim 
 Pls print for my NARUC call.  Jim 
 No need to prepare anything.  They'll do most of the talking.  Jim 
 Luiz -  Please get internal comments from Thane Twiggs, Sue Mara, Steve Walton, Dan Staines, and Dave Perrino before letting Doug go public with this document.  I want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis (for example, I think that you may have misinterpreted the FERC in the California discussion).  Jim 
 So the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?  Also, is t= he 50kw right for all markets?  Jim 
 ok 
 thanks. 
 Rogers --  FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.  Thanks. 
 I hope you are having fun at the Nutcracker Market.  Tell Christi and Susan hello. 
 I like it.  Our argument should be that the MISO is not an Indiana public utility.  I'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly.  Jim 
 Tom --  You may want to go to this event and report back to Susan Lindberg.  It could provide a nice overview of the status.  Jim 
 Sue --  Did you ever reach Terrie Wheeler?  Jim 
 We already knew it.  More importantly, I'd extend his thought to every competitive retail market in the US!!!!  Jim 
 The tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single NPV payment (discount rate issues), assuming that is part of the options.  Jim 
 Darran --  Pls submit an RCR for me to discuss at today's meeting.  RCR - EPSA SE RTO Study.  $60k.  Jim 
 Texas gas plan. 
 Thanks. 
 Then let's proceed with that model.  Someone needs to tell Jean B. not to get involved.  Jim 
 Christi --  Let's talk.  We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.  Have you communicated that to Kevin?  Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.  Jim 
 In what forum will this be discussed?  Jim 
 How about 9am tomorrow?  Jim 
 Dave --  I assume you are following this?  Jim 
 Thanks.  Let me know how the desk sees it.  Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (Don Black).  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 I want to go down with you.  Thx, Jim 
 Lisa -  While Wanda and I with the FERC team agreed on a process of moving forward, I want to make sure that the documents properly deal with how the FERC haircut will be handled.  When will you have a new version to read?  Jim 
 thanks 
 Thanks. 
 Is everything ok?? 
 Attached please find Sept's Government Affairs report.  If you would like to discuss, please let me know.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Haven't got anything today.  If I get some, I'll send to EPSA.  Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 How about Tuesday the 20th?  Should be relatively slow.  Jim 
 Rick --  I intend to take off the following days for vacation through the year-end.  Mon Nov 26 - Fri Nov 30 (5 days)  Wed Dec 26 - Fri Dec 30 (3 days)  Thanks,  Jim 
 Elizabeth -  Let's please meet this week to update this web site.  Jim 
 A good summary of current RTO activities.  Jim 
 Gary --  Do you still have a contact at Waste Management?  I hear their financial troubles seem to be under control.  Just wanted to start some inquiries?  Jim 
     --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?  Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie? Do we have any construction in progress? Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?  Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Houston time 
 Sue --  Here is the list of key customers in CA that may support our efforts.  Please work with Tom Riley to coordinate.  Jim 
 We spoke with Roger Yang.  They don't have anything on the shelf.  I started to look at the PG&E web site and figured out that you'd have to have a PhD in Oper Research to re-compute the PX Credit on an hourly basis.  Jim 
 Harry --  FYI. 
  Ok to travel.  Jim 
 Yes.  Have fun.  Jim 
 Chip --  The e-mail I referenced in my voice mail.  Please call if you have any information.  Jim 
 Also, please look at this file. 
 Thanks Chip.  If you hear anything else, please let me know.  Jim 
 Isn't Friday the Potluck?  If not - yes.  Otherwise, how about Thursday? 
 Can I get a copy daily? 
 Thanks. 
 Steve --  If you have not called SCE yet, now may be a good time to do so (given the failure of the Legislature to resolve their problems).  Jim 
 Rick -- Let's discuss bad messaging at NARUC meeting at our Thursday meeting.  Jim 
 Please arrange a call in # for 4pm Thursday. 
 We are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that Enron will either own or control in ERCOT to process the PUCT merger analysis.  If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.  If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).  We continue to try and get a handle on how the FERC Refund case will impact the PX Credit and Negative CTC.  If anyone has any issues or comments, please let me know.  Thanks.  Jim 
 I put it together from notes on the PG&E web site.  I may ask Roger to review.  Jim 
 Gloria --  Before we move forward, please talk with Steve Montovano.  Thanks. 
 Greek --  Here is our current list.  Thanks,  Jim 
 The $$ should come from the business people.  Jim 
 Great.  I briefly looked at your papers - the idea is very promising if you can find the agency/government.  Jim 
 yes. 
 Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.  On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.  All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.  Jim 
 Alan --  The only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Once done, let's have a phone call with the wholesale electricity team to discuss before sending to Ashley.  Jim 
 Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.  Jim 
 Lisa -  Something to think about.  Do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the Settlement?  Jim 
 Rebecca --  Pls work through Gloria and Bevin Hunter (in Austin).  My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.  I assume that you will create the report and Gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing. Gloria, we may need Marianne Carroll to sign??  Jim 
 Bob Frank will be coordinating with Services from Govt Affairs.  JIm 
 FULLY AGREE. 
 Thanks for the tip.  Why don't we try to have lunch in early December - I'm going to try and take off the week after Thanksgiving.  Jim 
 Ray --  Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.  Give me a call to discuss.  Jim 
 I intend to produce this monthly.  We had been doing it before.  If you have any questions about the matters included, please call.  Jim 
 thanks 
 Julie --  Enron would be willing to move forward with the Boston Pacific study (at the $15k) level.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Well.  Haven't they got themselves in a pickle?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?  Jim 
 I am planning on calling in from home.  Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?  If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.  My list -  1.	Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN) 2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale" 3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs 4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.  Many EPSA members (led by Williams) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.  Jim  [Steffes, James D.] 
 Ok.  I agree.  Jim 
 Don't worry.  Appreciate the thought.  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts --  1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature. 2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition. 3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings). 4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption. 5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions. 6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business. 7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.  I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?  Jim 
 Can we talk this week on our response?  Jim 
 Elizabeth --  I'd like to let Bryan take over this project.  Jim 
 Does EPSA agree that FERC should require all Transmission Providers should agree to an RTO of the FERC's choosing or lose MBR for all affiliates?  That's the other message Lynne should put out.  Jim 
 EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.  If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Harry --  I think that we need to talk with EWS Tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page.  I am concerned that some of Gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs.  Please advise.  Jim 
 I'll call Ashley and relay the message.  Jim 
 FYI.  Any thoughts? 
 Janet --  Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.  Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Jim 
 Harry --  Rebecca is ok with pulling the MD license until the issues are corrected.  Also, who is following up on the VA license?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Dan --  I will get with Evan and his team and pull this together.  Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).  Jim 
 Thanks. 
  Ray --  I assume this makes sense and you are incorporating into the case?  Jim 
 I'll ask around floor.  Given my background, this position does not sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term contracting (origination) side or business development.  Thanks for the inquiry.  As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.  I intend to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period.  Have a great Thanksgiving.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Let's do it at 5pm tonight at Teala's.  Jim 
 Janet -  1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter). 2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December. 4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.  Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I would recommend that if we keep Roy Boston we not keep Pat Keene and move Bob Frank to Texas with Roy Boston in the Mid-C.  Jim 
 As with everything else right now, I take no offense.  It was a pleasure meeting with you.  I wish you all of the best.  Jim 
 Gloria --  We need to keep this type of information in our matrix on Recent Contact.  Jim 
 Something to think about --  Topics to be covered in the Texas Intrastate White Paper:   1.   Current state of the Texas Intrastate Market 2.	Areas for improvement 3.	Proposed future state of the Texas Intrastate Market 4.	Strategy for implementation 5.	Actions for implementation 6.	Appendicies: a.	Form of transport contract b.	Gas flows in Texas c.	Basis price history 
 Diann --  I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?  Is this problem just related to residential customers?  Jim 
 Please do.  We could discuss on the regular NERC call at 2:30 Tuesdays.  Jim 
  FYI 
  Check this out.  Jim 
 Ashley --  First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.
