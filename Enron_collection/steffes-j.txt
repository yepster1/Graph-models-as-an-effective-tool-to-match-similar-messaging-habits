 Angela -  The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).  Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.  Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.  Jim 
 For the Monthly Update. 
 On coalitions, I was thinking about other market participants.  Agreed that= Cinergy could be the vehicle.  Also, maybe make an informal presentation t= o FERC before any filing, etc.  Jim 
 FYI.  These bills are currently moving through the California Legislature.  Not sure if the bills will be signed into law.  Please call with any questions.  From my quick glance, only good news is that it appears that the Windfall Profits Tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment.  Jim 
 Bryan -  Pls include on the Monthly update.  Jim 
 ???? 
 Lisa --  Rick Shapiro has offered to present.  I think that we can work up some presentation for 45 minutes.  Let's discuss soon the details. It is on his calendar.  Jim 
 The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.  There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.  Please call with any questions.  Jim 
 Fine.  Jim 
 Michele & Rick --  Please see the note below.  It is critical for you to call your clients (Ja= ck in the Box/Burger King and Wendy's) to try and convince them to push the= ir industry lobbyist to ask for a change in the date.  Call me at 713-853-7673 or 713-851-2499 (cell) to discuss. =20  Thanks,  Jim 
 I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.  Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).  I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.  My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work through AReM.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Christi --  I am comfortable with trying to settle.  I hate that this new Commission has to litigate this case.  It is important, however, that we focus FERC staff on the broader policy changes necessary throughout the industry and not just on Entergy's tariff.  Jim 
 I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?  I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.  Jim 
 Rick --  Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?  I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?  Appreciate your thoughts?  Jim   Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments. ``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the wholesale unit, government affairs. Anything that affects Enron,'' Lay said. 
 Hi Sweetie --  Out here in California.  Trying to rally support for competition.  Hope you and Grace are having a good day.  I love you,  Jim 
 Thanks.  Jim 
 David --  Here is some info the Windfall Profits.  Jennifer can keep you updated.  Jim 
 Please review first section.  Jim 
 thanks. 
 no. =20 
 Please include Becky Cantrell in this meeting.  Jim 
 Your call. 
  FYI 
 I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.  This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key "potential" customer.  Jim 
 FYI 
 When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 12:00 PM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Can you make this phone call?  Susan is on vacation. 
 When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 2:00 PM-3:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  I'll be on the call.  You guys are of course welcome.  My thought is that we need to push EPSA to do something on this.  Jim 
 I will be attending.  I'll cover.  Jim 
 They are active throughout the West - mainly California.  We can use them.  Both are good.  Jim 
 Kevin --  Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.  If Sue or Jeff know of later $ figures, please advise Kevin.  Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.  They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.  Jim 
  Let's set up the meetings.  Don't you think?  Jim 
 thanks for sending this out.  Jim 
 I haven't processed a bill. 
 FYI. 
 Thanks for getting the info to Keeney.  Jim 
 I don't know if we need to do anything.  Seems like they are just acquiring= the MAIN facilities, not market design material.  Have you spoken to anyon= e at ARTO to inquire?  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Linda --  Have you heard anything from DOE on this??  Jim 
 It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.  It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under Bill Bradford) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under Evan Hughes) for retail.  I spoke with Evan Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.  He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr Ibrahim.  Thanks. 
 Marcus N. says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning.  Sam Behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 203 filing and everything else is in place.  Steve Montovano has/is confirming that in PA, OH, and NJ there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters.  We probably want to put in place an update to Clinton's MBR that would allow for A/S trading.  Should we just have Sam do that work??  Jim 
 Tom --  I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).  Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."  The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.  The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).  My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??  Jim 
 =20 
 Fine.  People are shocked.  Jim 
 Linda --  Can you also please process Jose's documents?  Jim 
 FYI.  Do we need to communicate this to the trading / logistics groups?  Jim 
 Gloria --  I wanted to make sure that our License in TX allows us to use e-signatures?  EES is opening a pilot.  Jim 
 Marcus --  I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.  It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a "clean up" filing to be ready to go upon any action.  Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.  Jim 
 Here are some thoughts from me.  Jim 
 Lara --  I would think that Alan Comnes would be good (if he can make it) to go.  Jim 
 FYI.  Who are they hiring as lobbyists?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Scott --  Good to hear you were ok.  Let us know if you need anything.  I'm stuck in DC right now and trying to get home.  Jim 
 Leslie --  It's my understanding that Janine is just reviewing the Eastern US.  If I'm wrong, Janine please correct me.  Thanks 
 Let's sit down at 5pm to discuss.  Jim 
 Maggie --  You may want to attend - Global Markets?  Jim 
 Amr --  Not for us to contact the ISOs about our Material change.  Jim 
 Great job!!!! 
 FYI. 
 Thanks.  Appreciate the quick response.  Jim 
 How about 10am Tuesday?? 
 FYI. 
 ok. 
 Leslie --  Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?  Jim 
 Great. 
 let's discuss at 5pm 
 I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do). 
 I'd say 6 pm at Daily Review or Marks.  What does everyone think?  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Guillermo --  Looks good to me.  I'll discuss with Amr to ensure his agreement.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Having this e-mail on the agenda for the upcoming meeting is very helpful.  Jim 
 Sue --  My thoughts on the filing.  1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate. 2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct? 3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  Thanks,  Jim 
 The PPO - Power Purchase Option - is a unique program based on the IL restructuring law.  Texas has no analogous service.  I agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.  It's important to keep consistent messages.  Jim 
 Thanks for our new model.  Pls let me know how it is going.  Jim 
 Lisa --  I appreciate your note greatly.  While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.  Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.  Best of luck in your future plans.  I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.  Take care,  Jim 
 I agree that we are losing money.  That's not the reason for getting out of this case.  What is the upside?  Even if we win, we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time.  Is this really the best strategy?  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts.  I have to be honest, I'm struggling with the Transco / RTO split.  Jim 
 Luiz --  I don't think that I'll send this given the current direction of the PUC to move forward with TX.  I do think that these points are important and maybe Jean R. can get them in verbally as appropriate.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Janine -  Ok for you to cover the whole country.  I had forgotten our discussions.  Please discuss NM and AZ with Leslie Lawner.  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:  1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.  2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?  3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.  5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.  6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?  Jim 
 I spoke with Ashley yesterday.  Awaiting NG's filing.  No plans right now.  Will keep you in the loop.  Jim 
 FYI 
 I probably shouldn't be so serious, but I think the current situation at Enron has made me less fun.  Jim 
 The $$# is 530MM 
 Yes.  I had called him to set up a meeting.  We talked recently in PA when he told me he was taking the job.  I'll arrange lunch (if everyone wants to) soon.  But don't delay talking with him.  He wants as much help from Enron as possible.  Jim 
 Rick --  We do have an on-going dispute with the PAPUC about our assessment for gas sales.  The charge is $150k.  We are suing with others the PAPUC to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed.  Jim 
 Trying to run down the information.  Jim 
 Howard --  Did we deal with the EES letter from NYISO MMU?  Pls let me know.  Jim 
 FYI.  Not sure if we can afford this, but if you think it's helpful let's talk.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info guys.  Jim 
 Resend 
 Do we need to file on the NOPR on Partial Day Recalls??  Will EPSA file?  What position will they take?  Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position?  Jim 
 Got it.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Was the amendment approved by FERC?  Jim 
 FYI.  Will you attend the meeting at FERC?  Jim 
 Fine.  Why not have this as the first element of EISB Wholesale Quadrant??  Jim 
 Ray --  Have you looked at the testimony?  It appears to be hitting the key points.  Is there anything else that we need to be doing to make sure that our case is as strong as possible?  Give me a call.  Jim 
 Not sure.  Probably won't be ready until end of year.  Jim 
 Attached is a summary of the SCE meeting to discuss our Negative CTC claim.  Call if you would like any additional information.  Jim 
 Marchris --  Pls provide John with any further information.  Jim 
 If we do take over this type of role, what issues and information would the NYISO be entitled to?  We are pushing DG and load curtailment very actively.  Jim 
 Melinda --  Let's talk soon.  I want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision.  Jim 
 Alberto --  Pls ask Sue Mara where these stand.  I thought that the FERC didn't approve.  Jim 
 Pls send asap the information to have me submit to Rick.  Thx,  Jim 
 Good to hear from you!!!!  I hope all of your family is well. I was in DC o= n Tuesday am and drove in last night. =20  Jim 
 Rick --  Andy is looking for about $1500 for tuition reimbursement.  I would, if we can afford it, pay this.  I indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful.  Thoughts?  Jim 
 Sounds good.  Maybe we can employ the Gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a "workable" solution --  let's just decide what that is (maybe some bare minimums on RTOs)?  Jim 
 Look at this web site  www.southerncompany.com  Go to the section "NEWS & ISSUES" section of the web site.  They compute the cost of moving an electron from New Orleans to NYC.  Jim 
 Rick --  Are you going to put out the new org chart by this Friday?  Jim 
 Howard --  How did this mistake happen?  Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices?  Does this cost the desk $$?  Maybe the NYISO shouldn't be doing this?  Jim 
 Harry -  This is the meeting.  Jim 
 The TX MONTHLY story.  Jim 
 We should inform FERC Enforcement.  No formal filings.  Jim 
  Bill --  Joe Hartsoe (Fed Reg Affairs) got cc: on the demand letter from PJM.  I assume you have the letter.  If not, please let me know - Joe sent me a copy.  Jim 
 I'd say $395 is fair.  Jim 
 No known timeline yet.  I'm still discussing internally.  Jim 
 I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks.  Jim 
 We are pulling this together and will talk with Marcus Nettleson as appropriate.  Jim 
 I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program= for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely track= s the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational = signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load respons= e needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a = DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.  By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We shou= ld make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.  Jim 
 Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??  Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?  Jim 
 I am beginning to agree with Dave on Governance - that a for-profit TransCo may not be in our best interest.  Let's talk about how to change the wording.  Jim 
 Wanda --  Can you break out for me the ISO and PX money due?  I need to make sure that our Settlement is consistent with our FERC Refund issues?  Jim 
 I can attend.  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Ok.  But let's keep the time and $ minimal.  Jim 
 FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.  Not s= ure why this is even in the Settlement except to ensure that IURC won't int= ervene at FERC.  We should not sign based on this information.  Jim 
 Yes 
 We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year (see #2 below).  Let me know if there are any issues.  Jim 
 Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts??  Do they know not to do anything going forward?  Jim 
 Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).  Jim 
 After the PHC today, we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for.  Sue, can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps.  Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 Thanks.  If the May 2002 date starts to slip, pls let me know.  Jim 
 Let's discuss this afternoon.  Jim 
 Rick called Lynne Church to discuss maybe having EPSA put out daily "papers" on market issues.  EPSA did this at the FERC RTO Week and it worked very well.  Jim 
 John --  Thanks for the update.  As long as the FERC is fully in control and the ERO is not a "self-regulating" organization, I assume we'd be ok.  The ERO must be fully under the control of FERC.  Jim 
 I didn't say that was ok.  She was to move on Nov 15.  Jim 
 Help as much as you need to.  Jim 
 Harry, Janine, & Bob --  Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).  He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the Simon Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.  Thanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.  Jim 
 Joe --  I forwarded the call from Phil to Bill Bradford and let Kevin Presto know.  If you hear anything else, pls let me know.  Jim 
 Thanks.  I don't think that I want to travel to Europe right now.  Market opportunities are slowing down.  I think that we'll go to Mom's for some time.  You can always come over through the weekend to see Gracie.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for the update - I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Jim 
 ok. 
 I think that Christi's write up is great.  I've only changed two things.  If anyone has any more changes, please get to Janel ASAP.  Jim 
 Pls let me know.  Jim 
 Sue --  Please work with Diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven= or simply an internal process of SCE.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks for asking.  This is a very strange place.  Our core trading is doing very well.  It appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the Corporate level without any risk management.  I'm doing very well.  Marianna is expecting our 2nd child next May.  Grace continues to grow and become a little person.  Hope you and your family is doing well.  Jim 
 I didn't know that I was all powerful.... 
 Barbara --  Any decision on the payment?  Jim 
 Just to keep you in the loop on SCE negotiations.  Jim 
 Who will attend and present?  Jim 
 Should we work through AReM?  Jim 
 Amr --  Can we use cash as collateral for PJM??  Jim 
 Can you please add this to the general write-up for each ISO?  Thanks 
 Pls print and have for my NARUC phone call.  Jim 
 Can we move it to 3pm?? 
 FYI 
 thanks 
 Mike --  Ashley Brown called to discuss a meeting with the Stakeholders in Columbus, OH on either Dec 4 or Dec 5.  He would like our participation.  Also, he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties.  Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.  Jim 
  Interesting ideas on Reliant and Orion asset transfer.  Jim 
 In our discussion of the Duke model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?  Would the Duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.  Maybe make this point stronger.  Jim 
 Pls print for my NARUC call.  Jim 
 No need to prepare anything.  They'll do most of the talking.  Jim 
 Luiz -  Please get internal comments from Thane Twiggs, Sue Mara, Steve Walton, Dan Staines, and Dave Perrino before letting Doug go public with this document.  I want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis (for example, I think that you may have misinterpreted the FERC in the California discussion).  Jim 
 So the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?  Also, is t= he 50kw right for all markets?  Jim 
 ok 
 thanks. 
 Rogers --  FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.  Thanks. 
 I hope you are having fun at the Nutcracker Market.  Tell Christi and Susan hello. 
 I like it.  Our argument should be that the MISO is not an Indiana public utility.  I'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly.  Jim 
 Tom --  You may want to go to this event and report back to Susan Lindberg.  It could provide a nice overview of the status.  Jim 
 Sue --  Did you ever reach Terrie Wheeler?  Jim 
 We already knew it.  More importantly, I'd extend his thought to every competitive retail market in the US!!!!  Jim 
 The tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single NPV payment (discount rate issues), assuming that is part of the options.  Jim 
 Darran --  Pls submit an RCR for me to discuss at today's meeting.  RCR - EPSA SE RTO Study.  $60k.  Jim 
 Texas gas plan. 
 Thanks. 
 Then let's proceed with that model.  Someone needs to tell Jean B. not to get involved.  Jim 
 Christi --  Let's talk.  We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.  Have you communicated that to Kevin?  Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.  Jim 
 In what forum will this be discussed?  Jim 
 How about 9am tomorrow?  Jim 
 Dave --  I assume you are following this?  Jim 
 Thanks.  Let me know how the desk sees it.  Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (Don Black).  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 I want to go down with you.  Thx, Jim 
 Lisa -  While Wanda and I with the FERC team agreed on a process of moving forward, I want to make sure that the documents properly deal with how the FERC haircut will be handled.  When will you have a new version to read?  Jim 
 thanks 
 Thanks. 
 Is everything ok?? 
 Attached please find Sept's Government Affairs report.  If you would like to discuss, please let me know.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Haven't got anything today.  If I get some, I'll send to EPSA.  Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 How about Tuesday the 20th?  Should be relatively slow.  Jim 
 Rick --  I intend to take off the following days for vacation through the year-end.  Mon Nov 26 - Fri Nov 30 (5 days)  Wed Dec 26 - Fri Dec 30 (3 days)  Thanks,  Jim 
 Elizabeth -  Let's please meet this week to update this web site.  Jim 
 A good summary of current RTO activities.  Jim 
 Gary --  Do you still have a contact at Waste Management?  I hear their financial troubles seem to be under control.  Just wanted to start some inquiries?  Jim 
     --------- Inline attachment follows --------- 
 I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?  Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie? Do we have any construction in progress? Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?  Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Houston time 
 Sue --  Here is the list of key customers in CA that may support our efforts.  Please work with Tom Riley to coordinate.  Jim 
 We spoke with Roger Yang.  They don't have anything on the shelf.  I started to look at the PG&E web site and figured out that you'd have to have a PhD in Oper Research to re-compute the PX Credit on an hourly basis.  Jim 
 Harry --  FYI. 
  Ok to travel.  Jim 
 Yes.  Have fun.  Jim 
 Chip --  The e-mail I referenced in my voice mail.  Please call if you have any information.  Jim 
 Also, please look at this file. 
 Thanks Chip.  If you hear anything else, please let me know.  Jim 
 Isn't Friday the Potluck?  If not - yes.  Otherwise, how about Thursday? 
 Can I get a copy daily? 
 Thanks. 
 Steve --  If you have not called SCE yet, now may be a good time to do so (given the failure of the Legislature to resolve their problems).  Jim 
 Rick -- Let's discuss bad messaging at NARUC meeting at our Thursday meeting.  Jim 
 Please arrange a call in # for 4pm Thursday. 
 We are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that Enron will either own or control in ERCOT to process the PUCT merger analysis.  If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.  If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).  We continue to try and get a handle on how the FERC Refund case will impact the PX Credit and Negative CTC.  If anyone has any issues or comments, please let me know.  Thanks.  Jim 
 I put it together from notes on the PG&E web site.  I may ask Roger to review.  Jim 
 Gloria --  Before we move forward, please talk with Steve Montovano.  Thanks. 
 Greek --  Here is our current list.  Thanks,  Jim 
 The $$ should come from the business people.  Jim 
 Great.  I briefly looked at your papers - the idea is very promising if you can find the agency/government.  Jim 
 yes. 
 Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.  On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.  All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.  Jim 
 Alan --  The only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Once done, let's have a phone call with the wholesale electricity team to discuss before sending to Ashley.  Jim 
 Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.  Jim 
 Lisa -  Something to think about.  Do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the Settlement?  Jim 
 Rebecca --  Pls work through Gloria and Bevin Hunter (in Austin).  My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.  I assume that you will create the report and Gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing. Gloria, we may need Marianne Carroll to sign??  Jim 
 Bob Frank will be coordinating with Services from Govt Affairs.  JIm 
 FULLY AGREE. 
 Thanks for the tip.  Why don't we try to have lunch in early December - I'm going to try and take off the week after Thanksgiving.  Jim 
 Ray --  Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.  Give me a call to discuss.  Jim 
 I intend to produce this monthly.  We had been doing it before.  If you have any questions about the matters included, please call.  Jim 
 thanks 
 Julie --  Enron would be willing to move forward with the Boston Pacific study (at the $15k) level.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Well.  Haven't they got themselves in a pickle?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?  Jim 
 I am planning on calling in from home.  Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?  If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.  My list -  1.	Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN) 2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale" 3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs 4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.  Many EPSA members (led by Williams) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.  Jim  [Steffes, James D.] 
 Ok.  I agree.  Jim 
 Don't worry.  Appreciate the thought.  Jim 
 Here are my thoughts --  1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature. 2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition. 3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings). 4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption. 5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions. 6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business. 7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.  I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?  Jim 
 Can we talk this week on our response?  Jim 
 Elizabeth --  I'd like to let Bryan take over this project.  Jim 
 Does EPSA agree that FERC should require all Transmission Providers should agree to an RTO of the FERC's choosing or lose MBR for all affiliates?  That's the other message Lynne should put out.  Jim 
 EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.  If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Harry --  I think that we need to talk with EWS Tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page.  I am concerned that some of Gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs.  Please advise.  Jim 
 I'll call Ashley and relay the message.  Jim 
 FYI.  Any thoughts? 
 Janet --  Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.  Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Jim 
 Harry --  Rebecca is ok with pulling the MD license until the issues are corrected.  Also, who is following up on the VA license?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Dan --  I will get with Evan and his team and pull this together.  Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).  Jim 
 Thanks. 
  Ray --  I assume this makes sense and you are incorporating into the case?  Jim 
 I'll ask around floor.  Given my background, this position does not sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term contracting (origination) side or business development.  Thanks for the inquiry.  As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.  I intend to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period.  Have a great Thanksgiving.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Let's do it at 5pm tonight at Teala's.  Jim 
 Janet -  1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter). 2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December. 4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.  Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I would recommend that if we keep Roy Boston we not keep Pat Keene and move Bob Frank to Texas with Roy Boston in the Mid-C.  Jim 
 As with everything else right now, I take no offense.  It was a pleasure meeting with you.  I wish you all of the best.  Jim 
 Gloria --  We need to keep this type of information in our matrix on Recent Contact.  Jim 
 Something to think about --  Topics to be covered in the Texas Intrastate White Paper:   1.   Current state of the Texas Intrastate Market 2.	Areas for improvement 3.	Proposed future state of the Texas Intrastate Market 4.	Strategy for implementation 5.	Actions for implementation 6.	Appendicies: a.	Form of transport contract b.	Gas flows in Texas c.	Basis price history 
 Diann --  I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?  Is this problem just related to residential customers?  Jim 
 Please do.  We could discuss on the regular NERC call at 2:30 Tuesdays.  Jim 
  FYI 
  Check this out.  Jim 
 Ashley --  First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.  Thanks,  Jim  =============================  1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?    2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?  3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?  4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?  5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?  6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?  7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model]  8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?  9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?  10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?  11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?  12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?  13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models 
 Nice to meet your brother.  Do you have a map of the 25th?  Jim 
 Yes this gets at my issues.  I want to build your matrix and Rebecca's together.  No where do we deal with reporting yet?  Also, we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming "point people".  Jim 
 I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.  Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.  Jim 
 Christi --  I'm out next week.  This is a bit touchy with the changes coming.  Why not have Jose agree to go  (no one else) and if necessary we'll backfill.  Jim 
 My thoughts --  1.	Great job. 2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs. 3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter. 4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.  Thanks. 
 LUIZ --  Attached is a version that I changed.  Mainly formattting the intro.  I think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front. We want a White Paper that reads like an advocacy piece.  Please add to whatever you are doing.  Also, move forward with contacting Larry Ruff for (1) his analysis of your and my combined draft and (2) a simple affadavit on this.  Govt Affairs will pay up to $10k for this work out of our current budget.  We need to have this finished by Tuesday EOB.  CHARLES -- We need to make sure that Monday and Tuesday someone calls everyone on the Committee considering changing these rules on Thursday.  Let's get the list and start lobbying actively.  Call me if you have any questions.  Please talk with Doug Gilbert-Smith about who and where.  Maybe Christi and Jean Ryall can help.  CHRISTI -- Pls make sure that Steve Walton and Sarah Novosel are ok with this statements.  Thanks.  Jim 
 We need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any RTO - unless and until I hear something different from FERC, my going in assumption is that Enron will be one of the only voices on this issue.  We should only give on this issue when real value is being created.  Why not file a "me too" on the issue of seating of the Board w/o agreeing to everything else?  Jim 
 Not sure if there is much to do.  I was just sending this e-mail because I saw Alan working to find a copy as well as John Shelk's team - wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts.  Jim 
 Ginger --  Can you please approve?  Jim 
 It's been amazing.  Jim 
 Pls pay. 
 No. 
 Jaime,  Please add James Steffes, user id is jsteffe, to the App_BlackBerry group for BB usage.  Thank you for your help,  Matthew Campbell 
 PSE&G called yesterday to ask for an LC or cash collateral of $1.0 MM to displace our Corporate Guarantee of $1.3 MM.  They are sending more information in a letter to Bill Bradford copied to me.  THere is a 5 day turnaround - early next week this will be due. 
 Yes.  He is now a big-time headhunter.  I hope you had a great Thanskgiving.  Things are crazy here.  Jim 
 Let's talk early next week. 
 Right now we are trying to develop some info and the right messages.  This is the same everywhere.  Our gameplan right now is to work this next week.  Jim 
 It sounds better on FM - you can pick up the wonderful vocals.  Didn't hear too much from Rush on the drive - he was probably in a bunker worried that the Taliban was after him.  Jim 
 Bob --  We need to pull together the rules, etc. for a change in assignment w/o consent for small commercial in NYC and TX by 3 pm tomorrow (or earlier). Grab me and we can discuss.  Jim 
 We will need to let everyone know early next week - working on msg -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Wade -  Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing Enron put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.  So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.  Jim 
 Password = jinglebells  Jim 
 Christi & Sarah --  Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.  Jim   Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred. 
 Did you hear anything on WM?  Jim 
 Julie --  Given our current situation at Enron, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.  I assume that you were already thinking this.  This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.  As soon as we come up for air, I'll call and fill you in on the developments.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 This is the price tag for COBRA from Enron.  Looks like $600/month.  Jim

 Chantel  --  Please call me at 713-853-7673 to assist with any questions.  Jim 
 Please keep me in the loop on developing opportunities. 
 Pls send to Mike Terraso with Environmental Policy.  Jim 
 I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.  I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.  Critical that our message is consistent and clear.  Rebecca, any thoughts?  Jim 
 Jeff --  Please don't forget to get load #s or de-DASR customers - probably 50+%.  Good info to cover our "remaining" customers.  Jim 
 FYI.  Let's deal with this early tomorrow.  Jim 
 Harry --  EES filed yesterday.  My thought is to focus on keeping our licenses so that we can return customers in an orderly fashion.  Jim 
 Christi --  When is this meeting?  Also, Dave Forester is looking for someone to present (through Rick Shapiro call).  Is this the same meeting?  Call me.  Jim 
 Mike --  Going forward, should all enviro be sent to you? 
 Please send all questions on environment to Mike Terraso.  Thanks. 
 Evan Hughes are we Dual Billing our current ConEd customers? Gloria Ogenyi will we owe more $$ if we don't switch to Dual Bill?  Scott Gahn what are the issues if we do switch?  Thanks. 
 Pls hold for inclusion in CPUC letter today.  Jim 
 Thanks.  I've enjoyed working with you and more importantly, getting to know you.  Best of luck going forward.  If you ever need any thing, please don't hesitate to call me.  Jim 
 Thanks Becky.  I've truly enjoyed getting to know you better as we've worked closer these past few months.  You've taught me alot about natural gas issues and if I can ever do anything for you please let me know.  Jim 
 Thank you -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Appreciate the thoughts.  I especially appreciate your hard work over these last few weeks.  Jim

 Jeff pls call Bryan Gottfredson at 713-942-7307 to discuss possible job openings in CA. 
 No Yeung + Lindberg are gone -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 In speaking to the PUC today, they are under the impression that we are currently physically serving Compaq and JC Penney.  Is this right? If so, don't we want to deDASR them?  Jim 
 In OH I believe that the MSG service continues (transfers with the customers) so it's just any discount we gave above the MSG rate.  Jim 
 Good news.  Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).  Your thoughts - I'll call Drom back tomorrow.  Jim 
 Thanks Ann.  Pls send to me going forward (at least as long as we're here). 
 Jeff --  Pls call. 
 I agree.  In fact, in the conversation with the Chairman of PUCT, I told him that we were sending all of our pilot load back to TXU before Jan 1.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  Jim 
 Ok. 
 Christi --  I want to call Susan tomorrow and let her know about the mess up on her.  But I want her to understand the issues involved.  Let's talk as soon as possible.  Jim 
 Your message was forwarded to me regarding Dan Allegretti and NPCC.   Can you please let me know what Dan's role was in the organization and any other information?  Thanks,  Jim Steffes 713-853-7673 
 Don --  Sempra called today and said we had been nominating but not delivering any gas since Saturday.  Customers are on penalty gas.  What is the story?  Should we just put these customers back to the Utility and let them find another marketer?  Jim 
 Sandy --  Can you please send all letters sent under Dan's name to him tomorrow.  You may want to send to Esmeralda.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Call u later -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron

 I don't know Aldie Warnock.  Thanks for the idea, but I'm going to try and get out of the regulatory world.  Might as well try my hand making $.  I know John Orr and John Meyer.  Not sure about going back to the traveling of RTO world.  Let me think on it.  Let's still do lunch sometime next week.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Thanks -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Anthony & Evan --  Who should process this?  Jim 
 There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.  To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --  1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).  2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =  TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes. Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.  4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.  5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.  6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.  Jim 
 Thanks Marianne.  We've been in contact with the PUC but we will need some help next week.  Are you in Monday?  Jim 
 I don't know of any EES collateral at PJM.  Very small position in PECO territory.  Jim 
 FYI 
 Angela --  To follow up on our discusion about TX customers (e.g., Home Depot), are there any other customers that you are going to include in the sales effort (not including CA)?  I want to make sure that we include these customers in our analysis.  Thanks 
 By "these customers" you mean the non-mass market - ie, Home Depot?  Jim 
 Monday is better -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Great.  Jim 
 Sue -  Lyndon's info is:  (713) 751-3048 (w)  ltaylor@h-s.com  Happy Holidays,  Jim 
 Once again, Enron shows that it has the best damn reg affairs team in the world - maybe universe.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I'm ok with this.  Jennifer will be good for RTO campaign.  Jim 
 Steve --  Christi left you off this list.  Please include your thoughts on this worksheet as well for Eastern gas.  Thanks,  Jim 
 No.  We worked with Paul in the Indianapolis office.  Jim 
 Friday 10am is best with me.  Pls include Christi Nicolay and Susan Lindberg.  Jim 
 Or doing some interviewing -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Christi pls send spreadshet -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 Call Jeff Brown - he use to work there -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 To follow-up on NEPOOL matters --  Last week, the NEPOOL Members Comm did not take any action against Enron.  I received a call today (that I intend to return tomorrow) from Dave Doot - NEPOOL Secretary.  He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.  The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.  I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?  I will call Dave Doot and find a good time for later this week when I can arranage a call with the appropriate people.  Call with any other questions.  Jim 
 Harry --  Let me write-up some things on this and will send to you.  Hope everyone is well.  Jim 
 Maureen --  Thanks for the information on the switching of the "held" customers.  We will process through a standard EDI transaction.  I am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount.  When I find out, I'll e-mail you.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Marcus and Ed can we talk today about this.  Is there a good time?  I need to get back with NEPOOL today.  Also, while our business dropped off, I am guessing that NE-ISO has been arranging energy for our UI load and our payable is growing pretty quickly.  Jim 
 Agreed.  Talk w/ Joe H to confirm that we are consistent with preferred P/L policies.  Jim 
 Didn't know about this.  Have we compared this list to our gas market termination list?  Jane - Can you please send me the list?  Jim 
 Customers we will start to de-DASR probably next week.  VERY CONFIDENTIAL 
 I see that UC/CSU is on this list.  Have any buyers been interested in their load?  Jim 
 Dan, etal --  Someone from CSC was on the call (Allison Hafner).  TXU said the meters were to be read by Dec 13 with final EDI files sent to ERCOT by Dec 14.  ERCOT would process a REP of Record change on Dec 13.  Looks like everything is ok.  Jim 
 I will review the list.  But I need someone from gas team and someone from power team to help.  Let's talk at 9am meeting tomorrow.  Jim 
 Can we get together this afternoon to discuss calling NEPOOL?  How about 3pm?  Jim 
 Let's meet at Christi's desk on ebS5 and find a conference room.  Jim 
 Suzanne --  Becky Cantrell had entered Enron into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).  I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.  Elizabeth Linnell has the papers on 47.  My initial thought is that Enron does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.  We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.  Please let me know if you can take care of this.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Paul --  I have no information as discussed below.  Jim 
 Mary Lynne -- Is this for both EES and EEMC?  Is EPMI in this bill?  Can we pay separately by company?  Jim 
 Doug --  The PUCT called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information.  Have they communicated with you about this?  Jim 
 They would like to talk to you.  Jim 
 FYI 
 Please add so we can get to Fallon on Monday.  Jim 
 Doug --  It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?  Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.  Jim 
 Please comment ASAP.  Want to get to Fallon.  Jim 
 PJM sent a bill for the 2002 Annual Fee (for $5000).  Upon paying the fee, EPMI will be able to access E-Schedules.  PJM is looking for payment on December 20, 2001 along with our November grid payment.  I assume that no Enron company will need the E-Schedule system after January 1 and therefore we will not be making this payment?  Please advise.  Jim 
 Also have we returned our physical PJM customers yet?  Jim 
 With the cancellation of a number of Surety Bonds by our providers, we are faced with a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL.  Also, it is my understanding (although I haven't seen anything) that our Nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on Dec 20, 2001.  Christi and I are trying to work out our payment plans (if any) and other requirements to keep our books afloat.  We need to have support on understanding any payment obligations (and bills if we have them) and issues (e.g., Annual Fees).  Who can we talk with for each market?  Thanks,  Jim 
 When: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 4:30 PM-5:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
 FYI.  Call if you need anything.  Jim 
 Jim --  Here is a quick and dirty overview.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Jim 
 Lisa and Dave --  Are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for EPMI?  The issue with NEPOOL is that our UI/CMP/NSTAR wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we don't pay these guys.  I don't know if we should pay, but I need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached.  I know that John Llodra is trying to sell these positions.  Jim 
 Bob --  Please follow up with Juan so we can ensure coverage.  Jim 
 Mary --  I need to know the other bonds that aren't cancelled.  Are there more?  Jim 
 Come to 9am mtg -------------------------- Jim Steffes Enron 
 FYI.  Thought you'd be interested.  Jim 
 I am trying to pull together a list of the pre-petition and post-petition claims against EES and EEMC (and EPMI where collateral may exist as one entity) as well as any other obligation in the key power and gas markets.  I hope to have this tomorrow.  Jim 
 Let's talk tomorrow.  Jim 
 Alan --  1.	Is Sue Mara going with you?  Who else is going?  Anyone from commercial or scheduling?  My understanding is that Ray Alvarez is attending?  2.	Do we have a list of issues that we want to go through with the CAISO?  Maybe outlining our Top Ten before the meeting and getting internal agreement (maybe even with the other participants) makes sense?  Thanks 
 Wade -  There may also need to be another $100k for EESI.  Jeff is checking.  Jim 
 Chris -  I did discuss Enron's payment issues with PJM with our team.  To make sure that we are on the same page.  1.	No additional collateral is required at this time. 2.	EPMI owes on 12/20/01 = $1,704,182.63 EESI owes on 12/20/01 = $134,456.58 3.	The Annual Fee is also due on 12/20/01 = $5,000 (one fee for all affiliated companies).  I will call you tomorrow.  Jim 
 ISO-NE is seeking the following by December 20, 2001 to continue Enron's presence in the market --  EPMI Amount Due	$2.1 MM Security	$112.1 MM  EES/EEMC Amount Due	$6.2 MM Security	$22.2 MM  1.	We are verifying these figures (ISO-NE may have EES and EPMI Amount Due reversed) 2.	The process post 12/20/01 is unclear - not sure if Enron companies can schedule without posting Security 3.	Surety Bonds have been revoked and Safeco/Fireman's sent notices that Bonds can not be used for post-petition claims EES	#6131506	$12.0 MM EES	#11133420767	$8.0 MM EEMC	#11133420783	$14.4 MM EPMI	#6131468	$12.0 MM EPMI	#6107679	$40.0 MM  I can't imagine that Enron will post collateral in these amounts.  In the CAISO market, Enron has 3 days of projected expenses as Security coupled with a going-forward power supply.  May be an alternative worth considering?  Any other questions, please call me at 3x7673 
 How do I take care of this?  Jim 
 Ed --  Can you please draft a letter (similar to what Paul Darmitzel sent to gas LDCs) to send to PECO Thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled POLR service is not objectionable to EES?  We have a bill due in PJM this Thursday that may not get paid.  If we don't pay PJM on Thursday, our brief analysis of the PA Supplier Tariff is that PECO can pull these customers back.  The customers in PECO are GNO (e.g, Suiza), so not sure what the contract issues would be - maybe Michelle can help here.  My understanding is that the contracts should allow EES to serve using Utility power, so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not.  Please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Troy --  A few questions --  1.	The counterparty "PGE" - is that Pacific Gas & Electric or Portland General Electric? 2.	When do you think that you would have the "Unknown" researched? 3.	I assume that the costs associated with ERCOT or CAISO are captured in the EPMI and ENA payables?  Thanks. 
  Ed is drafting the letter and coordinating with Michelle.  Jim 
 My understanding is that Jim Wood is making the recommendation on Etown. Correct?  Jim 
 Dave --  I wish you and your family all of the best.  May you have a happy and prosperous New Year.  Please keep in touch.  Jim 
 Diann -  Sorry about all of this confusion regarding residential customers.  This guy was listed on the Ken spreadsheet (about T&D bills) as being an EES customer in November.  Is this a residential account?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Guys --  Don't know if we need to do our own study.  Probably want to get with this prof to discuss.  I agree with his analysis that the electricity markets needs a bunch of sellers - means we should push for distributed generation.  Thanks 
 Janet --  FYI.  I intend to take vacation this Friday, all of next week, and Dec 31.  Unfortunately, Harry Kingerski, Bob Frank, Jeff Dasovich,and Christi Nicolay will also be on vacation.  If something urgent comes up, you can call me at home (281-759-8270) or on my cell (713-851-2499).  Thanks,  Jim 
 Thanks.  Diann, I know that the last few months (year?) has been tough on all of us.  I appreciate everything you've done.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Does everyone have access to the O Drive / Public Affairs directory?  I'd like to keep an external contact list (PUCs, Utilities, etc.) and any material we are creating (files, documents, etc.) in this area so the entire team has access in case someone is out for the day.  To get into this, go to MY COMPUTER, find the O Drive and then find the Public Affairs folder.  If you don't have access, please let me know.  Thanks,  Jim  P.S.  If I don't get to speak directly with everyone, I hope that y'all have a safe and happy Holiday Season!  See you in the New Year. 
 Paul --  Why so "unhappy"?  Isn't this the best time of your life?  I know that I am truly looking forward to telling my grandkids that I not only worked at Enron, but I survived the "collapse".  Don't worry about the O drive thing - I'll take care of it.  Jim 
 Wade -  I would recommend that no one pay.  The wire instructions are at the bottom of the earlier e-mail.  The $ are pre-petition.  Thanks. 
  Ed --  I'll put in a call to discuss with them the contact point.  Jim 
 May need to post TX PUC collateral.  Jim 
 Linda --  Yesterday you mentioned I had a small work assignment during the meeting.  Didn't get the exact details.  Any info is appreciated.  Jim 
  Charles --  Please work with Susan Lindberg on this as well.  Jim 
 I only have one question - the NYISO may be replaced by a NERTO as soon as this year in December.  What is the timeframe of the contract?  Also, the NYISO rules may change - what happens to our deal?  Do we have rights to restructure?  What happens if ICAP or UCAP goes away as an obligation?  Jim 
 I'll be on holiday during this time frame.  Don't wait for me.  Jim 
 John, etal --  Not sure if there is any real "issue" we can push.  Maybe something on the P/L side (see Joe Hartsoe).  Clearly this idea that RTOs will be anti-security is mistaken - it just implies that there should be redundancy of systems.  Jim 
 Pls fax to SF office today.  Thanks,  Jim 
  Bryan --  Add this to the report database.  THanks.  Jim 
 Susan --  Muchas gracias.  Thanks.  Jim 
 Does change in law mean the implementation of the NE RTO?  That process is underway and whatever happens with its implementation we should already have a knowledge of?  Jim 
 Call Thane Twiggs.  I'd also be interested in seeing this through - there was a little confusion about Enron's position earlier but we are now ok.  Jim 
 Tammy --  I sent this report to John and Louise last week.  Intend to make it monthly.  Similar to earlier.  I will include you on it going forward.  Sent to John's asst.  Call with any questions.  Jim 
 Is this good or bad for Enron?  My take is that this doesn't help us push f= or ONE RTO. =20 Jim 
 Please add to Reg Orig section.  Jim 
 Don't know where you guys are with the negotiations, but here is another small issue with PG&E that would be nice to work through with them.  Jim 
 Michael -  I've asked the outside consultants to give us a % change for the impact of the refund case.  Try to give these to you asap.  Ray Alvarez will you please follow up with CRA and Jan Acton?  Thanks,  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Leslie --  What would it cost for outside counsel to do the hearing?  Maybe running an RCR through with the biggest $$ allows Shapiro, etal to discuss next Tuesday?  Jim 
 I think that this list is fine.  Any thoughts to including the key Industrial customer and legal rep for the Munis / Coops while in this area?  Jim 
 Sounds good to me.  Any thoughts to have Milnthorp support the Conservative= s and Devries (or someone else) do the Liberals?  Jim 
 Should we try and agree with the other market participants on a list of issue prior to the meeting?  Maybe coordination also with FERC staff prior to the meeting?  Don't want to appear that this is "ganging up" but we do need to be prepared to go in with a clear idea of what is a "good" meeting.  Jim 
 too late. 
 I will be attending.  Jim 
 Christi --  Like we spoke about yesterday, the key play here will be to understand the retail opportunities.  Let me know how your efforts to get a good synopsis goes.  Don't forget to use Jennifer Thome to help in this effort.  Jim 
 thanks for the reply.  we will be reviewing the applications in due course.  probably best to work through the standard process. 
 Becky --  FYI.  Does EGM have any past advocacy on NURF?  Jim 
 I'd let Alan make the call.  As long as we understand the issues well, maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg.  Jim 
 Jennifer --  SBX2 18 and SBX2 85 are important to follow.  Jim 
 A couple of thoughts --  1.	Ashley Brown and Rick have a great relationship.  Don't hesitate to use Rick to find out some details if you need him.  2.	Are we supporting this?  I don't understand why we would agree to make NG the MM with this process / paper?  Thanks. 
 Howard -  Have you and Jeff Brown talked about the MG deal?  I want to make sure that you understand fully and appreciate any issues / concerns.  Thanks. 
 Do we need to have a phone call with you, Harry K., Charles Y., Sarah N., Christi N., John Shelk, Gloria O., Vinio Flores to make sure that Enron is on the same page?  I don't think that we will see much support from the business people, although maybe you and I can sit down with Evan Hughes to get his buy-in.  Let me know.  Jim 
 Do we need to have a meeting to work through this?  What outside counsel is supporting the sale right now?  Jim 
 Dan -  Spoke with Janet Dietrich yesterday.  Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions.  After meeting with Sean Holmes, it was agreed that our policy work would say (1) no retroactive DA suspension (at least not earlier than Sept 1), (2) don't end DA but study how to allow it to continue.  If the CPUC does suspend without retroactive, the fear is that re-starting the CA market will be very difficult.  Please call me when you get some time.  Jim 
 Thanks.  As long as the business guys (and King & Spalding) aren't preventing the appropriate filings, I'll assume this deal is done.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Does Howard understand your deal and the going-forward issues (if any) that he needs to be aware of?  I want to make sure that he knows what is important and unimportant to this (and other load curtailment).  Jim 
 Paul --  Please give me a call (if possible today).   I am taking vacation from tomorrow through next week Friday.  Jim 
 Linda -- Pls put on my calendar.  Thanks,  Jim 
  Bob --  Did we send this?  Jim 
 I'll be going.  You should go if you want to go.  It's a good opportunity to network.  Jim 
 EEI's work is nothing more than the NERC language (but shorter).  Still the key difference - self-regulating versus standard setting.  Given that EEI seems to believe that the Canadian issues are minor, why get rid of the self-regulating nature?  Jim 
 Becky --  Thanks for the updated list.  I will include it in our database.  Please continue to coordinate with Roy Boston on the "info" reporting.  Jim 
 Linda --  Please set up some time (about 1 hour) after I return from my vacation with Dave Duran and Rick Shapiro and myself to discuss Enron's Wholesale & Retail Advocacy Positions.  Thanks.  Jim 
  FYI.  Please try and attend.  Bob, it would be good to have your issue list on the TFG Brief and next steps before the meeting to this group.  Jim 
 Bob --  Any concerns with this language?  Not sure if we are even going to file, but want to be ready.  Sue --  While this draft talks about July 1 retroactive date, I'd guess this would be filed if the CPUC does anything before the Ordering date?  Jim 
 No, but I'm happy to ride with almost anyone.  Jim 
 Bob --  Jeff talked with Fielder.  Your thoughts on next steps?  Jim 
 FYI. 
 Janine --  I would have EPMI be the party of record.  Also, please make sure that Susan Lindberg gets a copy of all filings to pass along to the Midwest desk.  Thanks,  Jim 
 on holiday 
 I am trying to find out if anything went out and if so, will be in touch with the document.  Jim 
 Alan -  Appreciate your thoughts.  Jim 
 yes. 
  FYI 
 Richard  --  FYI. 
 Please add to the database.  Jim 
 Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.  Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.  To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.  1.	December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting  Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???  2.	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers  Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.  3.	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)  a.	Define workable TCR Product b.	End Balanced Schedule requirement c.	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters d.	BENA/OOM/AS e.	Settlement & Billing  4.	Retail Issues  a.	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick) b.	Reliant PTB (Pat Keene) c.	TXU PTB (Pat Keene) d.	Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene) e.	TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene) f.	EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)  5.	Information Flow  All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.  It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels "cut out".  The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.  6.	Wholesale Products  Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.  Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our "home" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.  Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.  Jim 
 Beth --  Who on your team can I get to move forward with this report?  Jim 
 PLEASE INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION. =20 Jim =20 =20 
 Vicki --  I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?  Who should I talk with?  Jim 
 Ok.  Jim 
  Leslie --  Please let me know what you need to get this issue properly defined by EES.  One option, maybe, would be to take the customers back to sales service.  Would there be any problems with this?  Please let me know.  Jim 
 If Reliant is interested in filing, we should seriously consider using EPSA.  Reliant is a member of EPSA.  We could get EPSA to work through Larry Robertson maybe.  Let's discuss next week in Houston.  Jim 
 Mike --  You should contact Lisa M. about the SCE meeting arrangements.  I will be there in spirit only.  Jim 
  Bryan --  Please include the first 3 on the Regulatory Ventures section for next month.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 I would probably not sign on directly, but would support the document with the additional thoughts --  1.	I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation. 2.	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation. 3.	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.  Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide "sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably"?  California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.  The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete? 4.	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO "activity" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete? 5.	What is a "point-to-point" financial hedge?  Does this imply node-to-node?  Can we include some discussion of market "hubs"?  How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?  Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?  How should existing transmission arrangements be managed? 6.	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?  Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?  What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?  Should this be borne by the system or the generator?  My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.  Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.  Jim 
 Sarah --  Please pound EPSA into submission on the NE RTO.  Jim 
 Alan --  I assume that you will lead Enron's response to EPSA's comments?  Should we have a discussion of this filing before the EPSA meeting on Friday?  Pls give me a call.  Jim 
 Interesting.  Seems to me that EPSA needs to help AZ do better by its citiz= ens - it's not just APS that's a "bunch of neanderthals" (to use a Rick Sha= piro phrase). =20  I don't understand something else - Is Mumaw APS' and EES' counsel in AZ?? = How is this possible?  Jim 
  Understand.  When you speak of the gas desk, are you talking to Scott Neal and Frank Vickers or Don Black??  We should make sure that both groups recognize our message.  Jim 
 Sue --  I agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that= they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money. =20  What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates = for 4 years.  All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensatio= n for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, t= his implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs. =20  The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have = kept from consumers through the fixed rate. 
 I think one thing that is good is for every California call you make us go through the key bills in some organized outline.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Becky--  I spoke with Don Black.  Please work with Donna Greif to get this done.  She is responsible according to Don.  Also, if possible so we don't have to rush our IT and pay extra money, what about asking FERC to give us a 15 day delay for filing.  Probably just file to do it and ask for forgiveness.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Can you please resend the fax to Barbara Hueter about the TN legal bill?  Thanks, 
 FYI.  Use as necessary. 
 Linda & Sarah --  Please get with Jean to discuss.  I don't think that Enron needs to send this right now with everything else.  Jim 
 CA supreme court filing.    [Steffes, James D.] 
 Thanks.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Probably also want to talk with Brad Nebergald.  Jim 
 CONFIDENTIAL -- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE OUTSIDE THE COMPANY.  Attached is a spreadsheet of how prices may change with the FERC Refund case.  This is still subject to change.  Hope this helps with the Negative CTC calculation and negotiations.  Jim 
 1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC  Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year.  2.	MISO vs. ARTO  IP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year in Illinois.  3.	CTC Bet in ComEd  My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.  4.	Delivery Service Tariff Litigation  ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.  5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination  ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to "deliver" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?  6.	Relative Size of Current EES Book  ComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010) IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)  Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.  Jim 
 sounds like the right approach to me 
 lower rates first - they still don't get it 
  Does this process conform w/ regulatory reqts? 
 yes.  just info.  may help to have Sue Landwehr on call to hear your thoughts.  JIm 
 Good memo. 
 Sue --  Please follow up with Roskow at the CPUC.  I hope that he can get an answer before EOB Monday next week.  Please keep me in the loop on this.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Keep up the good work.  Jim 
 Please include as appropriate.  Jim 
 Looks good.  I agree that making arguments about merchant generation "stranded costs" is questionable, better to couch this as "structural impact on market participants".  More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.  FERC has the right to make markets work.  Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.  In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.  A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?  If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Becky --  I hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now.  Our budget is again under fire by the business groups and I want to try and do everything we can to create value for the businesses.  I appreciate what you are doing on this.  Thanks for everything.  I understand the bind we are in with timing and the importance of getting this report in to FERC.  Jim 
  This story appears to be about residential.  Do we know if C&I has feared so poorly?  What are the problems with entering the market for those customers?  Have these customers been angry or pleased?  Jim 
 Jean --  Please take the lead working with Mike D Smith to clarify that we don't have any issues.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Sue & Kerry -  Do you know if anyone is going to this?  Should we work with EPSA to publish an EPSA piece that corresponds to this?  Jim 
 HERE IS THE NEW FILE. 
  What do you think that about having Kerry take the lead on all MAPP area RTOs while also supporting Roan in MISO/ARTO?  Not top priority but I think this could be a good opportunity.  Jim 
 Lamar  -  There is alot of noise in the media to find some customers who will state for the public record that they will be harmed by the retroactive suspension of DA.  At one point, you were going to get some customers' names & contact info to pass along to the media.  Any luck?  Karen Denne with PR is getting quite a few phone calls from California media sources.  The strategy has to be to downplay Enron and have the customer pitch "their pain" by this action of the CPUC.  Give me or Karen a call.  Jim 
 Your call.  I'll support you on whatever you decide.  Jim 
 I saw this recently.  It's true AND funny.  This place is amazing.  Jim 
 Thanks.  It was a nice dinner.  Jim 
 I don't think that it is one of our top issues.  I'd recommend that we stay out.  Jim 
 Janet --  Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).  I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.  In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.  I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.  Thanks,  Jim  PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status. 
 Can we talk about this and a number of other issues tomorrow?  I'll try and get Linda Noske to arrange a time.  Jim 
 Thanks.  It makes sense for Gloria and Rebecca to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked Gloria to set something up).  Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).  On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?  Call if anyone has any questions.  Jim 
 Agreed. 
 FYI 
 Please get this to Fundamentals.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Janine --  What does this do to our current book of customers on MSG?  Will our $$ margin evaporate?  Is there some other "solution" on how to restructure the FE retail market?  What wholesale issues does FE need to change to help the EWS desk?  Jim 
 Lisa --  You should also attend.  Jim 
 Ok.  But if this case ends up in Settlement, we should have our priorities outlined before the case.  Jim 
 Attached please find the Nov GA report.  Please call with any questions.  Jim 
 Mike --  I'm guessing that Sue and/or Jeff have responded.  The short answer is that there are going to be a number of legal tests before we are "completely" in the clear.  Jim 
 Thanks.  Let's get together (just you and I) and figure out how we can make sure our teams are working together.  I am sure that you don't want to worry about this stuff any more than I do.  How about for 15 minutes after the EES Op Comm on Monday?  Jim 
 Had a call from Tribolet.  He agrees (as does Lisa M.) that we need to rationalize our California legal support.  Can we outline our key cases?  Also, my opinion is to continue to use Mike Day but have YOU as the only "point of contact" for approval of work.  Let's talk today.  We will need to talk with Vicki.  Jim 
 Documents developed for NARUC by Janel, etal.  Jim 
 Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.  He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.  He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.  I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.  Jim 
 FYI 
 That's good.  Jim 
 Agreed. 
 Did we want to get off the Creditors Comm. 
 Your thoughts??  Jim 
 Here is the note. 
 Any issues for the P/Ls or for Tim Belden in the West?  Jim 
 FYI.  Also, does the same obligation present itself in Illinois?  Are there any restricitions or obligations on EES as a marketer in IP territory?  Jim 
 FYI.  Jim 
 A couple of thoughts --  1.=09NG is trying to schedule a meeting in Columbus either Dec 4 or Dec 5.  2.=09I did speak with Ashley.  He indicated that NG has no specific inclina= tion to avoid LMP in the real-time.  He did not, however, confirm that NG w= as indifferent.  3.=09I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his p= oint #1.  NG may simply have misstated its intentions.  But clearly this po= sition makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would = be giving up too much).  4.=09I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownersh= ip of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.  5.=09Let's try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the Londo= n office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.  Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the= attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meetin= g?  Thanks 
 Jackie --  Pls send me a copy of the report.  Thx. 
 Mike --  EPMI is the QSE.  As long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally, then this should work.  My concern was that our customers would balk at Enron deciding how much of our costs they should pay?  Jim 
  Guys --  I understand the differences.  Becky is going to get on the EPSA call tomorrow and tell them that we are ok with the NOPR (and will file as such) and that EPSA should make sure to not blow up the NOPR (or try).  Becky if EPSA wants complete agreement, then they shouldn't file.  Grab me if you want to talk.  Jim 
 My initial take is to keep engaged through Perrino.  I'll try and make the call this Thursday.  Jim 
 Donna --  I'd say that it is a commercial matter.  Try and push the bill back.  I know that Paul says his RC is closed but someone above him has to have some $$.  Jim 
 Jean --  Why not ask Marianne Carroll to draft a short note on the current status of the docket and likely outcomes/timing?  Thanks. 
 My number is 713-853-7673.  See you Tuesday. 
 Nancy --  1.	Are we able to vote? 2.	If yes to #1, what is your recommendation for our vote?  Thanks,  Jim 
 We need to discuss the economics of this on our book (assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers).  Jim 
 Denise --  Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).  I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to "Financial Guarantees" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.  Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Andy --  I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.  Thanks,  Jim 
 thanks. 
 Why does Edison care about DWR stranded costs?  Are these the costs of the bonds or the above market long-term contracts?  Jim 
 I assume we are happier with this message? 
 Rick --  Please find attached the asset report in Texas.  Enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made (for instance, Indian Mesa won't be active until Dec and may be sold immediately).  Also, there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right.  Andy Edison has the lead from EWS legal.  Jim 
 Rick --  Here is the information on staffing and outside services.  Call if you need anything else.  Jim 
 ok 
 This means that the DST proceeding moves forward - right?  How about a phone call at 3pm HOUSTON TIME to catch up on all matters?  Jim 
 Lunch works.  I thin 11:45 is best.  Jim 
 Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday). Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.  The Utilities continue push for a "hard" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.  Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.  Jim 
 Not sure yet.  We will be talking with AReM and will want your input.  We may have to file but not sure.  Jim 
 Linda & Sarah --  I intend to come to DC tomorrow night and attend the EPMI v. FERC hearing (if I still have a seat).  I'm planning on attending the GENI meeting Wed pm and Thurs.  Thanks,  Jim 
 I know that was the plan and we do intend to work with AReM, but we may have to file if our needs aren't met.  Jim 
 Thanks for the invite but I'll think the DC team should brief Greg on the beltway politics and energy policy.  I'll join you guys at the Supreme Court invitation window.  Jim 
 Gloria --  Where are we on a matrix of Utility agreements?  Jim 
 How about heading off campus - less likely to run into Enron people.  Let's meet in the parking lot entrance (right where the little store is on the way to the Met) at 11:30.  If anything comes up, call me on my cell at 713-851-2499.  Jim 
 I would like to take something to Dan Leff by end of business tomorrow.  Whatever we have.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Jim --  How about breakfast on Wednesday this week?  I'm coming in tomorrow night and could do breakfast on Wed.  Jim 
 Draft. 
 After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.  If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.  Thanks. 
 EES does not sell power except potential if it overschedules to their retail load and "sells" balancing energy to IP.  I'm not even sure if we are delivering any energy to any customers in the market.  I'll send to Rogers Herndon.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Jean --  Is the PUC going to agree on AEP's motion (please see below)?  What are we = doing to stop this movement?  AEP is ready to go in Ohio with the same noti= ce but just haven't done anything in TX.  Jim 
 During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.  If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.  Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.  I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.  Jim 
 Molly --  Please let either Gloria or Harry know if you need our assistance.  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for keeping Wes and Mary Lynne informed.  I give this chance a very low probability right now, but we'll see.  Jim 
 Can we change the project lead on the RTO NOPR on Standards of Conduct to be both Lisa Yoho and Leslie Lawner?  Also, can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities - just a heads up?  In paragraph 2, your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart.  I think that Rick intends to send out to everyone in GA.  Maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Jim --  Just trying to follow-up on the next meeting?  Any news? 
  Alan & Paul --  See John Shelk's e-mail below.  Alan, you may want to coordinate.  Jim 
  Harry & Nancy --  I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  Let's talk.  Jim 
 Jo Ann --  Do you know if Dan Staines has an active Employment Contract?  JIm 
 haven't checked voice mail at home - in DC. have time to talk right now on phone?  Jim 
  Jeff --  How about a call tomorrow to discuss?  Jim 
 FYI.  The first memo. 
 Guys --  We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).  Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.  Thanks 
 Paul --  What happens if BPA doesn't join?  Jim 
 Pls come by at 11am.  Thx. 
 Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.  Jim 
 Dave --  Can you please send to Rick Shapiro the agenda for next Wednesday's meeting?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Steve --  I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --  1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint  We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  2.	California Legislation  SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.  Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.    3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona  Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.  4.	FERC Refund Case  Enron presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.    5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation  Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.  6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive  Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close). 
 HERE ARE THE FINAL SLIDES. 
 Wade --  Home 281-759-8270 Cell 713-851-2499 
 We should also make sure that Paul Kaufman and Pat Keene attend.  Thanks 
 Thanks for the info. I'll leave in your and Leslie's capable hands.  Jim 
 Sarah --  Should we try and lobby any of these witnesses prior to next week?  I was thinking about John Meyer and Peter Cramton specifically.  Jim 
 I'd have Susan Lindberg and Charles take on this.  Jim 
 John --  On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.  Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.  To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.  Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.  Jim 
 I think that Kerry Stroup is handling non-MISO/ARTO midwest matters. 
 John --  I'm heading up tomorrow.  Do we need a call today to make sure that my ducks are still in a row?  I don't have the Barton draft handy.  Jim 
 Shirleen --  Can you please send me the most recent version?  Thanks. 
 Vicki --  FYI.  This bill continues to move.  Jennifer Thome prepared this synopsis.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I'll ask Jennifer to keep you updated on any changes and status.  Jim 
 Pls get with Susan to make sure coverage is appropriate.  Jim 
 Sounds good to me.  I'm out on Wednesday but in the rest of the week.  Jim 
 My comments --  I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12-15-02 date?  Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one "major" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.  Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition. Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.  Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business "easier" for companies like EES.  We should play this up.  We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.  I didn't see that language on consumer benefits.  Jim 
 Thanks for the info.  Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.  Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.  What will be his position?  Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?  Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally?  I think this is Wood trying to ask him how ERCOT works.  What will he say?  Thanks,  Jim 
 Sarah --  Pls coordinate with Kerry Stroup.  He is the Mike Roan of the Upper Midwest.  Jim 
 FYI 
 Is this moving forward?  Jim 
 Sue and Jeff --  I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.  My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?  Thanks. 
 Janine --  I have not yet talked to Kerry about this but the Translink is moving forward.  Will you do it today?  Jim 
 FYI 
 Sounds like flying Sunday night.  Jim 
 Please do.  Jim 
 Howard --  If the ONE RTO doesn't have a day-ahead market, what happens?  Jim 
 Thanks. 
 If you need anything else, please let me know.  Jim 
 Talk with John Shelk in our DC office.  Jim 
 Ban --  Sorry to take so long to reply.  Family is fine post NYC attacks.  Not sure if we have any needs right now.  I'll keep you in mind as the Budget / Staffing moves forward.  Take care,  Jim 
  Looks fine.  Thanks for everything.  Jim 
 Thane --  Pls work with Christi and Sarah to find a time to call John.  Jim 
 Dasovich this is in your court.  Jim 
 I looked at it today on the plane.  I don't see any issues although we are in the middle of budget process and will see if this impacts this request.  Jim 
 Charles --  If the RTO has the Interchange function, what else is needed for "virtual" consolidation?  Jim 
 Need to also include the moneys owed to Enron and its affiliates related to the wholesale power transactions.  We should also seek to clarify the language about us supporting the PE Advice Letter proposal on going-forward.  Jim 
 The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.  It's their $$.  So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the Mike Smith memo) are the "preferred" outcome - I'll reconfirm.  Jim 
 Rick --  This is the spreadsheet.  Jim 
 Louise --  Here is the analysis on how many Govt Affairs' FTEs work on Enron Americas matters.  The bottom line = 67 Professionals in group / 29 FTEs on Enron Americas.  Call if you want additional information.  Also, I am trying to arrange a meeting for this Friday to discuss our next Monthly Update (which I am finishing hopefully tomorrow).  Thanks,  Jim 
 perfect. 
 Pat --  I received your voice mail.  Will be testifying this morning.  I will try and call later today.  Thanks,  Jim 
 Fine.  I still think that any obligation is a mistake.  Just improving a bad market is not going to help.  Make sure that Dan Allegretti is in the loop.  NEPOOL is putting something like this together.  Jim 
 On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.  On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as ju
