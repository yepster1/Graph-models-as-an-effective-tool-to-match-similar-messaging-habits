 Where are you?  I'm leaving today at 4:30, I've got to get some things done. 
 Do you want to go to dinner sometime?  Maybe I'll have you up to the house where I can do some REAL cooking! 
   Bob,  Please note the following picks;  Paul Lucci - Oakland Joey Brewer - Oakland  I know I still owe you $160.00, remind me and I'll write you a check.  Paul 
   Max,  Please look this purchase proposal over and forward it on to the applicable parties.  This proposal is completely open for negotiations, you can reach me at (303) 575-6474 to discuss this proposal further.    Sincerely, Paul Lucci 
 Here is some more bullshit from CIG.  I wish they could get these tie-ins going!  I'll be out of the office Wednesday returning Friday late morning.  I'll be calling you but if you need me call me on my cell (303) 810-5708.  Tell Matt "Broncos all the way!" 
  This is why I like blondes! 
 I'm leaving for Wyoming tomorrow and will be out all week.  Let's try and get together some other time.  How are things with you? 
  Mike,  Here is the proposal we had discussed today.  Please look it over and I will contact you early next week to discuss it further.  Thanks again Paul 
   Mara,  This is updated.  I'll be using this hot list.  Thanks Paul 
 You are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.  Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you. I like to keep everything short and sweet. So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.  You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.  Too bad the car is full.  And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance. 
 I know I whant to find THAT girl! 
 Good morning, I do feel better today.  I think being outside yesterday brought out the worst in my cough.  Good luck in your talks! 
 Hey,  What's up with you?  I have been out all day so I just got in.  What's new? 
 =20 
 Who is telling you that they "Love You?" 
 That's good!  Is that at the Broncos' game? 
 Did I upset you?  I hope I didn't tell you anything you didn't already know. 
 This is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.  Thanks Paul 
 Heidi,  Here is my vacation schedule for the remainder of the year.  I should have 4 days to carry over once you take all these days into account.  Please tell me if this is correct.   Vacation: November 1st December 26th - 28th   Thanks Paul 
   As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."   Paul  PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

 yes, completely crippled.  he had to leave his car and take a taxi! 
 The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations. 
 That was funny!  I laughed my ass off.  Sorry I didn't call you, I left my cell phone at the office.  Have a happy Thanksgiving! 
 Yes I had a good weekend.  What about you?  Mark talked to Heidi today, so....... 
 Call me later tonight at home.  I kinda busy today and I want to get out of here early.  I'll talk to Mark about your start date.  Are you bored? 
 What are you trying to say? 
 Hello,  Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.  Paul 
 Hey what are you guys doing partying without me.  Yes I have been traveling, in fact I have been gone almost all October, up through the 15th.  But I'm finished.   When are you thinking of getting together? 
 Hello,  Thanks for the email.  I would like to talk more, but since I don't know yo= u I haven't a clue as to what to talk about.  I did notice you live in Morr= ison, do you work there also?  I like that area.  What about you and this s= ervice, have you been using it long, and do you like it?  Drop me a line an= d I'll start firing back questions.  Paul 
 I did have a good Thanksgiving, how about you?  Thanks I'll put this number on the deal ticket.  Paul 
 I just went down to the mail room.... I'll call you. 
 Extremely, AND everybody got a flower on Saturday night except me because you weren't there to buy me one!  What's up for this week, my hot tub is still crying out for you.  Oh by the way I figured out why the water is so harsh on your skin.  So, I will need to fix that ASAP.   It's giving me a rash, at least I hope that's what is giving me a rash.  See ya! 
 ME! 
 Oh yeah things are changing every minute!  We are partying!  What about you? 
 Hey call me tonight at home, so we can catch up! 
 Thanks for the email.  I have finally picked out a car, it's the BMW 540i.  I'm looking for a Black car, 2000 or newer.  Thanks for all your help.  Paul 
 Yeah, actually we are throwing a happy hour tonight.  You should meet us for drinks.  I'm going to lunch now, so I'll talk to you later. 
  Now here is fine one! 
 What did this week look like?  I'm out but I bet a lot of people are too.  Shoot me the updated list please.  And what's up for the weekend?  I'm starting early! 
 Carole,  Wow you are really bringing me down!  No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.  I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.  If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to Denver and I'll take you skiing!  Paul   Paul Lucci 4761 Yates CT Broomfield, CO 80020 cell (303) 810-5708 Hm (303) 469-6768 email  I need to get it fixed, I've been receiving everything here at work. 
 That's so weird, I'm been running around the office all day today yelling; we're done, we're done. But only for a different reason.  Do you want your old job   back?  Congrat's on school.  Come down here and buy us a drink! 
 We ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in Houston.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  What did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP? 
 Hey you.  I just came back to my office, the one I'm moving into once all the construction is over.  Only the contractor pulled out and all construction has come to a stop
