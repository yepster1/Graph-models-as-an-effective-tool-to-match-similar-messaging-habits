 Cindy  I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Cindy  I can play on Wed night if you need somebody.  Also would love to hit on Sat but maybe in a proam tournament at the Met (if that falls apart I might call you and see if you need another body).  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

No change.  Enron Power Marketing, Inc. April 1-5	US$374,720.00 April 6-10	US$374,720.00 March receivables unchanged.  Please call if you have any questions. Bill    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

   Hi Vicki Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.  Talk to you soon and thanks again.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Ellen  I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that right?

  Vicki  As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

 My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Cly= de's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the mod= ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were = starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But= in the meanwhile a preview.  The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin= g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve= ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe= rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall= enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will= be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After= hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne= w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me= et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi= ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide= nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be= able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p= ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  = He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h= im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is = something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c= an begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet an= other name for himself.=20   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Limor  The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of t= he DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version = to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written ag= reement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, sta= rting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters toget= her and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairl= y extensive due diligence review. =20  Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w C= Y.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the= WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought= , rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  = How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion,= but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

 I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

 Ellen  We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.

I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.  pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.

  Hi Martin  Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck. 
 no problem

 The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat .... on your trip ...... tomorrow.   It really is cold you know. My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient) 
 oops 
  Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.  Can you send them the CAISO language.  Should we send other language.  Can one of you attend (I will be on out on vacation starting July 20th) Thanks.  Hope all is well. 
 Hi Andy  I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending "adoption" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).  This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.  I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received  into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th.   Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.   Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.

 Hi John  Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate  mom's IRA into 3 accounts.  Can you email me your SS#.  Thanks 
 Hi Chris  1.  We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.  2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).  Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope. 
 thanks for the vm incredible! lunch next week? have a great 4th 
  Is this the book that was helpful  - should we order updates?

I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks   713 853 6349 
  (in my directory 2001/pg&e/extension1.doc) thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Unbelievable - thanks for the call.  How about lunch the week of July 9th? 
   Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).  Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Larry  Thanks for the email and the first draft.  I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon. 
 Hi Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases. ps Boston was great, thanks 
 yes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed 
  fyi 
   I reserved a court for 500.  Let me know in the afternoon if you can make it. See ya. Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi  Any chance we can play this week.  My schedule is surprisingly free.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 hi grant  I mailed the paperwork to the Y (on Bellaire) on Monday last week per the instructions of the Indian Princess leader at the Y.  I also sent the check for 170.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 unbelievable  hope the end is near - I'll try to avoid calling (I do know your number) until I see Lisa and Sheila back in Houston 
 Thought you might find this interesting 
 fyi for the future 
 THANKS 
 Hi Paul   Hope all is well - I'm sorry I've been so out of touch.  My mom passed away this year and .....  I would love to talk to you this week but I'm on my way to Boston tonight and will not be back until Monday.  Lets talk then. 
  fyi 
 Can you open this for me?  thanks 
  Oh boy

  DItto 
    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Can you help me figure out how to get access to this.  I get this message everyday and don't  know what to do. 
 Hi Peter  We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 CY  These contracts are the CDWR deals that got released over the weekend - I'm glad you have them (I was getting copies from Reliant but I'll wait for yours... it will be really interesting to see how the CDWR deals were done). 
  Alice=20  Please RSVP no for me ( I will be out of town at a wedding).  Which reminds= me.  We always need to send an email to Janette (and Mark? - ask Janette f= or exact policy when I am out of the office for a day.   thanks 
 Alice  Can you call Janice and let her know status. Thanks 
  oops - already done 
 Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words. 
 The system won't let me review these requests.  It says that I am not authorized to review the content.    Liz 
    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 did you book? 
 Thanks for the reminder - I have calls into Bill/Michael but .... no thoughts yet.  Lisa seems to think PG&E has lost motivation to do anything.   High and dry in the HEIGHTS DOCTOR SAGER - available for notes  at any time in exchange for timely (read PRC) testimonials  fyi - we have scheduled our wholesale training session for Wed, June 20th at the Doubletree 
 ok w me 
 Thanks for the words - given my week, my month, my year, I need all the reminders I can to refocus and prioritize.  Hope all is well with you.

    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Oh no.  In the meanwhile,  Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.  Sam misses you.  I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?  I miss you.  I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?  Everybody is fine. 
 done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?  In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call. 
 While I'm still making plans, go ahead and reserve room for August 9, 10, 11.  thanks 
 Unbelievable!  Thanks 
 NICE! EAT WELL! SLEEP SOUND!  ps be aware of hidden hotel costs for internet  - christian in san antonio worked on the internet  for several hours only to be billed $3000 for long distance telephone time. 
 My group calendar is Power Group 
 At the request of Ed Sacks, attached is a draft form of agreement pursuant to which EPMI would be able to assign certain power trades to a third party in order to reduce AEP's exposure to EPMI.

    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps. 
 thanks 
 Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.

 HI Pamela  Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.  Elizabeth 
 Hi Andy  I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help. 
 Hi  THought you might get a kick from this.  Hope you made it home smoothly and spent the weekend playing soccer.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to play. 
 Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there  PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs. 
 Hi  Can you can hit on Wed (lunch or afternoon fine for me)?  Talk to you soon. 
 more(same) of prior email request 
 Hi Kathy  Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Can you review? thanks

 Thanks for the feed back - it may not have been the same Greg Johnston (she said that her Greg had an "e" at the end of his name) 
 FYI  Alice's first day at Enron will be this Friday, June1st. She will be in employee training on the following Monday.  Alice will also be supporting Harlan Murphy, a new lawyer that will also start on Friday.  Thanks 
 Greg and Peter  Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input. 
 Hi  Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the sun set, too"

 Hi Paul  I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 57400. 
  Janet and Genia  Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks 
 Hi John  I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY ), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about invoicing. 
 Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.  On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule? 
 Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back. 
 sounds great 
 Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us? 
 Hi  Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us late? 
 Hi  Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything.

 We are half way home - You passed the drug test (excellent).  Still no news on the background check - but HR will call the service this morning and get back to me. 
 some add'l humor 
 Still sore?  Up for tennis?  I can play Wed or Thurs.  Talk to you soon. 
 thanks for the message - Enron definitely pays expenses.  I will call later to confirm time and possible training session (and also HR update) 
  Hi Paul  Mike Smith told me you would be representing EES in the new credit group.  There is a meeting today at 200 in 3872.  Call with any questions. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Martha I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people got the message that you tried to send today.  Thanks 
 This is what happened last time  when I tried to to send it.

 I got tickets! 
 I'll try again - here is TVA confirm with a few minor changes. 
 Hi John   Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St Clair in Houston could help you. Which one will depend in part on how you think the timing will go.  Thanks 
 Here is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation  Call with any questions.  Thanks

 Hi  Can you make sure we sent a copy of the Newport presentation to him.  Thanks 
 CY   Can you call Larry and find out if he received and if not, resend, thanks. Phone no. is on lower email. 
 I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Yuck - The hearing just got cancelled (I was on the way to the airport when notified) and rescheduled for Tuesday. Right now I'm scheduled to come up on Monday instead.  I'll call you when I know more.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 see you on sat   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Don  Ill call you when I get a moment - back to back meetings until noon but some will get cancelled - in meanwhile under "Discount" we will need to add a column for Discount Rate (which I think will generally be  our counteparties cost of funds)   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 article is ok with me 
 Susan Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response 
 David  I read this article and it looks ok to me - can you also read it (for legal issues and general correct information to the extent you know but not grammer, good writing...) and let me know if you see anything, Thanks. 
  here are some sample letters - this one is Mary's start - she did not go all the way through it. It is based on the PG&E letters.    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Scott  Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.  Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page.  This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   Hi Here are Relaint's comments - let me know if there is anything you want me to do on this.  Thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

  Hi Chris  Hope all is well with you, Tracy and the kids.  How is Addy (opps, spelling is bound to be wrong)?  Are you coming to the legal conference?  And now for the real reason of my email - Can you send me Tracy's telephone number.  I've been wanting to call her for months and say hi but the stupor got in my mind and I couldn't shake it free. Its a beautiful day here today - the first for months and I'm committing to a new .... well, at least a call to Tracy.  Hope to see you at the legal conference.  Did you hear I have to speak?  At least it is with Klauberg.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Stacy  October 23rd would be fine with my schedule.  Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 thanks for the update   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Attached is the PG&E schedule.  Call if you have any questions or  I could be of help.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 looks great - thanks everybody.  Alice will you send out to group from me.  I'm so busy you see ....   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Joy  Ella and I will be there on the 20th.  Thanks. Also, sorry for the delay on getting the $7.00 to you - its in the mail today.  Thanks again for everything. 
  This was sent to me by a friend in NY - I thought it was a helpful  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 I think Mary's idea is good - like with Calpine, we can just let them know that the draft is only for consideration.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   hope this helps   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Hi guys  This week doesn't look good for a lunch doubles date but how about next week.  Does Tuesday next week work?  If not, how about Thursday? Talk to you soon.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 no problem   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
   Ugh.  Where were you - things again got ugly on market disruption (brokers or dealers permitted up to 4 each with no requirement of equal numbers).  In the meanwhile, credit annex meeting has been established for Nov.1 at the Marriott on Coronado Island.  Talk to you soon. Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Peter  I am going to be out of the office the rest of this week but lets talk early next week about this .  Thanks Elizabeth 
 HI  So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.  Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Joanne  Thanks for your message - I will not be able to attend but when available would be interested in borrowing the tape. Thanks again.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Vicki  I looked Ed O up in the directory and he was listed as an EES VP in origination. He told me Mark Taylor told him to call me to get information.  Sound OK? Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi talk to you soon   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Ed  As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349. 
 Great - I'll see at 345 on Thursday.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
  Bill  Are you talking to PG&E about post petition power invoice?  I understand the Canadian receivable post petition was paid.  Is that right?  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 fyi in anticipation of some next step   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 OOPs again - I gave you my phone number.  My fax is 713 646 3490.  Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Brenda  please download this document and put in my directory in new file EEI Contract.  After pulling down email copies to Sandra Hrna and Robbi Rossi. thanks 
 Hi  Can you still play today? I could play at 12:30 or in the afternoon, say 3:00 or 3:30. Talk to you soon  Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 how about 330? 
 Instructions per SW.  I assume she is referring to the time submitted by Taffy.  Jeff H is my immediate supervisor. Thanks 
 Chaundra must have accidently forgot to forward to you. 
 Hi How about Tuesday at 1130 ( I'm meeting with all Enron power traders on Tuesday at 400 to explain the EEI contract - oh boy, that will be a blast). If that doesn't work I can also play on Wed. See ya 
 I can meet at 1115 for 30 minutes.  I will be in my office.  Tell him to call me here and if we don't finish we can resume later 
 She'll love it! Talk to you soon. Have a great weekend. 
 Hi Brent  Hope all is well.  I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls, usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all the other general terms and conditions. By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.  Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston  (Thanks Leslie)      Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/04/2000 09:43 AM 
 Lisa Thanks for the notice. Please add Janice Moore and Shari Stack to you list and delete Lou Stoler. Thanks Elizabeth 
 You both have been added to this list 
 Hi Want to play tennis next week? Wed/ Thurs,  lunch or afternoon works fine for me. Let me know. I'll give you more details later but the meeting with the traders went reasonably well. See you soon Elizabeth 
 Mitch  Give me a call when you get a chance, re the Gleason letter (I'm not sure I've left voice messages for you at the right place). Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 That would be great.  I have court 2 for us at 330.  Let me know if we need to change it; otherwise I will see you there. Elizabeth 36349 
 Jim  Friday morning would be great for the Gibbs & Brun lawyers to meet with Tabors.  They have been speaking to him about a meeting in DC next week but if we could do it here it would be fantastic.  Let me know if you can get Tabors to stay over.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Hi  I talked to Grant and we are definitely considering coming up assuming we can make it work with your schedule.  The week you are in BI may work out great. We will get back in touch with you as soon as we check the details.  Thanks for the great offer and encouragement. I'm praying we can make it all work out.  Ella is a size 8.  Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.  Liz 
 Oops. Address for shipping is  822 Columbia Houston TX 77007  Ella will be so excited to get a package/swimsuit - Everyday now she asks if she has gotten any mail (she loves opening things and the idea that the world is sending her things)  Thanks again and hope to see you soon. 
 David  Can you look this over. Thanks 
 Tues at 930 or 200 would be fine. thanks 
 FYI 
 This is the subject of the meeting w Larry for 230 today on 31 in control room 
 Christian I'll fax my comments to you re this in the nest 30 minutes.  After you receive, call with any questions. Thanks 
 Janice  You could help Christi et all on this Thanks Elizabeth 
 David  Could you please look at this? Thanks Elizabeth 
 Hi John  Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call. On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to. Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.  Talk to you soon.  Hope all is well.  Elizabeth 
 Please print attachment and send copies to Richard Sanders, Mark Haedicke and Bob Madden. Thanks 
 tues sounds great 
 Leslie Can you please forward to the appropriate person 
 Can you print this? 
 Brenda  Please turn this into a draft in my TVA letter file.  We will work on later this later today. thanks 
 Please review.  If OK I will send down for signature.  Sager

 At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an "Into Product" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available on the EEI web page).  The only other definition of an "Into" product of which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page or the definition published by NYMEX for its "Into Entergy" product.  If you have any questions about the "Into" energy product that is so commonly traded in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg "Into Entergy", "Into TVA", "Into Cinergy", "Into ComEd"), please don't hesitate to call me.

 Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable    Hi Tim  Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA.  PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).  Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
 Phone is busy so ..... Will have agreement shortly.  Please send fax numbers (no electronic  copy) where you want it sent.  Hope all is well. 
 I can go the 11th  Happy Birthday BG 
 fyi 
 Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable  Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks 
 per my vm 
 CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT  Please review attached memo and provide me comments early Thursday morning. Kevin and Rodgers saw an earlier draft and I do not want to recirculate to them for their final review until we have all legal input. Thanks 
 Attorney Client Work Product Not Discoverable  Dave As explained in Presto's voice mail, attached is a brief memo discussing the proposed offer to TVA and a draft offer letter.  Elizabeth Sager 36349 
 thanks 
 Confidential Attorney Work Product Not Discoverable  Attached is a preliminary draft of the Legal Risk Chart.  You will need to open this in "Read Only mode"  Richard and Jeff -  As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise. Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with your written comments.  Thanks for your help.  Elizabeth 36349 
 Confidential Not Discoverable Attorney work product  I spoke w Richard - he agrees that Stuart should wait until after 5 BD to talk to the City and that it is ok to manage the position as we see fit. 
 FYI  TVA did not send notice of MOPA exercise for the summer 01 period 
 I rec'd notice and will be attending meeting as will David Portz with Enron. See you there. 
 per my voice mail 
 Hi  Charlotte  The week of the 16th looks good for me.  How about Wed. the 18th at 6:00 pm? If this doesn't work, I'm very flexible that week.  Let me know.  Thanks and I look forward to playing.  Elizabeth  ps  I'm out the rest of this week so lets confirm early next week. 
 Hi  Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail. Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.   Looking forward to seeing you Friday. 
 Can you send him a hard copy (He is w Constellation)  thanks 
 Could you also please send a copy to Andy 
 The 17th at 630 works great for me.  See you there. 
 ok w me 
 sounds great - enjoy  ps - Statement of Commitment sure looks interesting - what ever happened to indicative pricing and terms 
 Have a great weekend eating soggy hotdogs in misty, damp weather, dreaming of Genia on her cruise, all the while wondering about the meaning of quality time.  See you Monday am, not sharp.  Bye 
 Here is a draft of the PCA brief prepared by Dewey (head law firm of group effort).  Sam Behrends at Laboeuf is reviewing ( we just got today so he has not done so yet).  Sorry I didn't call you earlier about this. 
 Janice Moore and I have been helping Mitch w a proposal to connect Caledonia to Southern.  There is another project to expand the facility that we are not working on - I think maybe Sheila's group has that one.  Call me or Janice with questions. 
 This request from Shari is fine with me.  Could I also request a flat screen for my new office?  Thanks for your help.  Let me know what else I need to do. 
 Tennis on the 17th at 630 sounds great.  See you there. 
 fyi if you did not receive from shari 
 can you arrange this for after 200 or on friday thanks 
 oops sorry  marks' number 816 527 1314 
 Welcome back - I will call you later this afternoon.  Do you think you or Steve could look at this stuff relating to something in the WSCC 
 Thanks for the update.  So far, we are still trying to schedule meeting s w PCAs lawyers so there is no date certain by which I need the information. When we have one I'll let you know.  Thanks again. 
 Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable  Top Legal Risks  1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak. Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination damages, broad performance outs.  2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as to which entity is liable for which trades.  3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.  4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.  5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on a very tight time schedule.  6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on how to document transactions involving power.  7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure everybody understands risks associated with transactions.  Documentation Projects  1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen reliance on WSPP.  2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual transactions that are not part of a master.  3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power product definitions.  4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all e-trading.  5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  - work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll that into single contract for physical and financial trading 
 Hi John  Thanks for the call.  I'll be in Thursday all day after 10:00 (dentist in the am - yuk).  Lets try to get together then on the agency stuff. 
 Hi Susan  How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.  Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .  Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well (wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think. Sager 
 Per keegan's vm, here is the only thing we handed out.  Let me know if you want to discuss. 
 Just in case Hope all is well 
 See you between 200 and 230 
 Janette  Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you. Thanks for your help.  Elizabeth 36349  PS Mark  At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It seems that there is alot of interest in this idea. 
 Hi Tim  Thanks for your message.  We absolutely will forward to ISDA your message so that you can receive notices of the Energy Product meetings ( I thought you were already getting them).  Look forward to seeing you again soon.  Elizabeth 36349 
 I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.  Just FYI, depending on  the trade we would likely like to  add product definition (eg West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).  John  When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved. 
 Hi Dede Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week? How about Monday (anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya. 
 Welcome back - hope your sojourn was not alarming (NY is not that bad a place to happen upon independence),and the autumn leaves made you smile. Talk to you soon. 
 lets do Mon at lunch.  call you to confirm. 
 Still on for 1200 today?  Court 3.  See ya there unless I hear from you. 
 Hi Alex  THANKS - Ella rec'd the bathing suit and loves it.  She put it on and wouldn't take it off.  Perfect size.  Perfect gift.  WE ARE COMING - hope that's still OK.  We finally booked our flight to NY. We are planning on coming up on Sat. July 22nd and leaving on Sunday the 30th.  Not sure of the plans from there but will call you later.  If this doesn't work for you guys, let me know.  SO EXCITED about coming.  Talk to you soon. 
 $20 gift certificate to Oshmans (I'll start Ella's career with only the finest racquet available).  I wonder what the A PLAYERS get. 
 Hi Stacey  Outside counsel wants to schedule a meeting on the PCA calculations this Wed, the 25th.  Will you be able to have the data retrieved by then? Let me know asap. Thanks for your help. Elizabeth 36349 
 I thought this was to go to Dina. Sorry 
 OK w me thanks 
 Hi Andy  I was hoping when you get a chance, you could give me an update on where things were left at the recent meeting in DC and where we are going from here. Also, are you are anybody else thinking of going to Ontario as they try to work through creating a Master Power form. 
 please print also 
 Hi Charlotte Thanks for your message.  I can't play Tues (Halloween night with the kids - they would never forgive me).  How about Wed, Thurs, Friday, the weekend or a week from this Tues.  Let me know what works for you. 
 Bob  Here is what we sent TVA last year when we were notifying them of the delivery points we would have delivered to.  I'm tied up in meetings the rest of the day and we want to start notifying TVA of the delivery points we would have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver energy under the MOPA,  Could you please revise accordingly and send back to Bill Rust and me this afternoon,  We would like to start sending out tomorrow. As always, thanks for your help. Elizabeth 
 Thanks for your help - the comments were great. The only one I didn't understand was to "D".  Please review my revised draft and let me know if you think this works. Thanks again. 
 sounds like fun 
 Looking forward to playing at 600 on Wed, court 12. 
 good luck.  please acquire food. 
 Hi Carol  Was just wondering if you wanted  to play tennis, maybe sometime next week (I'm trying to get excited about something next week - work has been very busy and I need to fill in it with other things).  Let me know if you want to try and play. Hope all is well. 
 reservations for the 19th 
 Dede, per your vm, here are our draft West definitions.  THESE ARE VERY MUCH IN DRAFT FORM.  I WILL DISCUSS WITH YOU LATER Elizabeth 
 Elizabeth Sager with Enron will be attending 
 any interest 
 any interest 
 Hi Carol  How about Wed, the 8th? 
 Hi Melanie  On PCA, the dates proposed w Richard are generally fine with me, so .....  On the Rockets, thanks very much   ...... my husband and I would love to go to the Hornets game (16th).  Thanks again for lunch and I will talk to you soon. 
 Hi Christian  Is this thing for financial or physical trading  Thanks Elizabeth 
 Mark - for your approval  1.  Trip for me to San Diego to attend WSPP meeting.  2  Trip for Shari to Portland in November while Christian is on Thanksgiving holiday.  Thanks  ps - I will schedule a meeting with you this week to discuss Shari/staffing in Portland office. 
 Meeting on 9th from 10 -12 has been scheduled. Thanks 
 please schedule for me. 
 Genia  Can you please forward this to all lawyers in the power trading group.  Thanks 
 Mark  As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences.  Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
 Janette I'm not sure what you are looking for but here is brief description for power trading  ENA's Legal Power Trading group supports all of Enron's U.S.-based, wholesale trading legal requirements.  Enron is the largest marketer of wholesale power in the U.S.  This group currently has 6 lawyers (one located in Portland). Responsibilities include negotiating master trading agreements and structured power transactions, interfacing with industry trade groups to develop business practices and managing risks associated with the world's most volatile commodity.   Let me know if this is sufficient 
 fyi 
 Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing. 
 THANKS 
 I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely will eventually make the EEI contract the "default" contract if there are no other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.    drusso@reliantenergy.com 10/30/2000 06:07 PM 
 5:30 would be fine - I've changed our court time.  See you then. 
 please send thanks 
 I will be there. 
 I could make 1100.  Janice is out today so we can meet today without her and I will update her.  Let me know when and where. 
 please print 
 There are cheap tickets to DC (160) this weekend and I was wondering if I should go.  My mom says she is just far too busy for me to come.  She is alone and Bob is not coming back until next week.  What do you think. Ugh 
 Jim -  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am not aware that there is a "formal process" for being a board member of a non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks    James D Steffes@ENRON 10/30/2000 08:13 AM 
 Chris  Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous conversations with a Greg Malcolm there and he has said that they are very interested in contracting with EPMI using EEI.  He and Shari have a call scheduled for Nov 20th.  Just curious. 
 Steve and Christian  Could you please review and let me know what you think of this?  There is a call on Thurs at 200 (Central) to discuss.  Do you want to participate? 
 I'm available on the 8th 
 Tickets were still available so I'm going.  Commitment. 
 Regrettably, Enron also can not participate today - Monday does not work for me either but in my absence Shari Stack could participate.  Let me know and I will coordinate schedules with Shari. 
 I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we intended.  More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.  On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to "Canadianize" it, thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.  PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going? 
 As always, thanks for your help.

 Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable  A. PGE  I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the underlying contracts":  1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million  2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million  3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million   II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness  It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):  1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million  2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)  3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000  4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)  5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 million - see contract 2 above)  6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million  7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million  8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)  9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million  10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)  11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)  Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent (PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need to verify actual contract language.  B.  SCE Default  SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland General.
