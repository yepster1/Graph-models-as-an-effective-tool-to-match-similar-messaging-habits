 Cindy  I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks  Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Cindy  I can play on Wed night if you need somebody.  Also would love to hit on Sat but maybe in a proam tournament at the Met (if that falls apart I might call you and see if you need another body).  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

No change.  Enron Power Marketing, Inc. April 1-5	US$374,720.00 April 6-10	US$374,720.00 March receivables unchanged.  Please call if you have any questions. Bill    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

   Hi Vicki Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.  Talk to you soon and thanks again.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Ellen  I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that right?

  Vicki  As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

 My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Cly= de's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the mod= ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were = starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But= in the meanwhile a preview.  The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin= g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve= ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe= rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall= enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will= be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After= hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne= w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me= et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi= ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide= nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be= able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p= ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  = He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h= im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is = something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c= an begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet an= other name for himself.=20   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi Limor  The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of t= he DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version = to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written ag= reement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, sta= rting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters toget= her and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairl= y extensive due diligence review. =20  Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349

 Hi thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w C= Y.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the= WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought= , rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  = How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion,= but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

 I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

 Ellen  We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.

I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.  pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.

  Hi Martin  Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck. 
 no problem

 The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat .... on your trip ...... tomorrow.   It really is cold you know. My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient) 
 oops 
  Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.  Can you send them the CAISO language.  Should we send other language.  Can one of you attend (I will be on out on vacation starting July 20th) Thanks.  Hope all is well. 
 Hi Andy  I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending "adoption" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).  This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.  I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received  into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th.   Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.   Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.

 Hi John  Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate  mom's IRA into 3 accounts.  Can you email me your SS#.  Thanks 
 Hi Chris  1.  We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.  2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).  Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope. 
 thanks for the vm incredible! lunch next week? have a great 4th 
  Is this the book that was helpful  - should we order updates?

I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks   713 853 6349 
  (in my directory 2001/pg&e/extension1.doc) thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Unbelievable - thanks for the call.  How about lunch the week of July 9th? 
   Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).  Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi Larry  Thanks for the email and the first draft.  I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon. 
 Hi Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases. ps Boston was great, thanks 
 yes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed 
  fyi 
   I reserved a court for 500.  Let me know in the afternoon if you can make it. See ya. Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 Hi  Any chance we can play this week.  My schedule is surprisingly free.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 hi grant  I mailed the paperwork to the Y (on Bellaire) on Monday last week per the instructions of the Indian Princess leader at the Y.  I also sent the check for 170.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 unbelievable  hope the end is near - I'll try to avoid calling (I do know your number) until I see Lisa and Sheila back in Houston 
 Thought you might find this interesting 
 fyi for the future 
 THANKS 
 Hi Paul   Hope all is well - I'm sorry I've been so out of touch.  My mom passed away this year and .....  I would love to talk to you this week but I'm on my way to Boston tonight and will not be back until Monday.  Lets talk then. 
  fyi 
 Can you open this for me?  thanks 
  Oh boy

  Can you help me figure out how to get access to this.  I get this message everyday and don't  know what to do. 
 Hi Peter  We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 CY  These contracts are the CDWR deals that got released over the weekend - I'm glad you have them (I was getting copies from Reliant but I'll wait for yours... it will be really interesting to see how the CDWR deals were done). 
  Alice=20  Please RSVP no for me ( I will be out of town at a wedding).  Which reminds= me.  We always need to send an email to Janette (and Mark? - ask Janette f= or exact policy when I am out of the office for a day.   thanks 
 Alice  Can you call Janice and let her know status. Thanks 
  oops - already done 
 Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words. 
 The system won't let me review these requests.  It says that I am not authorized to review the content.    Liz 
    Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 did you book? 
 Thanks for the reminder - I have calls into Bill/Michael but .... no thoughts yet.  Lisa seems to think PG&E has lost motivation to do anything.   High and dry in the HEIGHTS DOCTOR SAGER - available for notes  at any time in exchange for timely (read PRC) testimonials  fyi - we have scheduled our wholesale training session for Wed, June 20th at the Doubletree

  Oh no.  In the meanwhile,  Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.  Sam misses you.  I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?  I miss you.  I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?  Everybody is fine. 
 done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?  In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call. 
 While I'm still making plans, go ahead and reserve room for August 9, 10, 11.  thanks 
 Unbelievable!  Thanks 
 NICE! EAT WELL! SLEEP SOUND!  ps be aware of hidden hotel costs for internet  - christian in san antonio worked on the internet  for several hours only to be billed $3000 for long distance telephone time. 
 My group calendar is Power Group 
 At the request of Ed Sacks, attached is a draft form of agreement pursuant to which EPMI would be able to assign certain power trades to a third party in order to reduce AEP's exposure to EPMI.

 By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps. 
 thanks 
 Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.

 A couple of minor changes - let me know if this is OK with you and then I will discuss with Mark Haedicke.  Thanks  ps blacklining seems to be all messed up but I tried 
 HI Pamela  Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.  Elizabeth 
 Hi Andy  I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help. 
 Hi  THought you might get a kick from this.  Hope you made it home smoothly and spent the weekend playing soccer.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 
 That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to play. 
 Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there  PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs. 
 Hi  Can you can hit on Wed (lunch or afternoon fine for me)?  Talk to you soon. 
 more(same) of prior email request 
 Hi Kathy  Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.   Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349
