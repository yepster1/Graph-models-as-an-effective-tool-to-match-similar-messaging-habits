 You may want to leave some time to general Rockies discussion this afternoon led by Frank and Steve.  Mike wants some order in the meeting it sounds like so you probably should leave some time for that.  Jay

 Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans:  Saturday morning:  70% chance of showers and thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain possible.  Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain likely.  Saturday late afternoon:  Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering showers.  Saturday evening and night:  Clearing skies.  That is the best I can come up with right now.  Front is moving through on Saturday and it is all based on timing.  If the front slows down or speeds up, then of course it will greatly change the forecast.  My guess is that the front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late afternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky.  Hope this helps.  Jay

 That will work just fine.
