 I still haven't caught her.  Supposedly her meetings end at 5, so if I don't get her then I'm leaving.  Have fun at dinner and don't stay too long when you come back.  Bye.

 I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  Talk to ya later. 
 When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have nothing else to do I might as well go. 
 Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm doing this afternoon.   Yippee! 
 About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that you blew him off.  R 
 I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here. 
 Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers that.  I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  Do you have lunch plans? 
 I hate Canada. 
 What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  Hope you're having a good day. Robin

 I'm leaving.  I'll see you Monday.  Hope you have a good weekend.  Te quiero. Robin 
 She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've told.  I think she feels priviledged. 
 I don't think she thinks we kept it a secret very well.  She also didn't think 2 and a half months was very long. 
 Brian,  We have someone new doing the P&L now.  Please include him on all emails. His name is Bradley Jones.  His extension is 713-345-8960.  Thanks, Robin 
 Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date.  Now she knows we've been dating since December. 
 Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down. 
 Jeff said if we were going to spend that much we should go to the Carribean, so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any destination suggestions.  RR 
 Hey,  Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke. Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information.  Talk to ya later, Robin  PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch? 
 I'm just glad you sent it to the right person. 
 Apparently you can't open the link so here's a print screen of the website. 
 Susan,  I'm trying to schedule a time and place for our farewell Happy Hour.  Let me know if this works for you.  http://www.qixo.com/Details.html?uRsltID=LF00  Robin

 I usually am right.  Stop laughing!! 
 Why would they want me at that meeting? 
 Does Mariner sound familiar? 
 Maybe if you had done more to relieve my boredom yesterday I would have been more willing to drive you back downtown.  I'm glad you made it back somewhat safely.  Later RR 
 Hey Lynn,  Thanks for checking up.  Laura and I spoke Tuesday.  She was going to contact HR and get back to me.  That's the last I've heard.  Robin 
 Nancy,  I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.  BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST  IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently used region code.)  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help, Robin 
 So you really were working on something and not just making up stories so I'd think you had a job!!  Authur Andersen has everyone checking up on a certain Enron subsidiary you might have some interest in.  Talk to ya later, Robin

 I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon. If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon. That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when I hear something.  RR 
 Sounds good. 
 I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.  Bye RR 
 There's no need to lie.  If you don't have anything interesting to tell me just admit it.  I'm bored not dillusional. 
 Hey Bags,  It's good to hear from you.  I wish I could make it, but I'm going home for the weekend.  Hope you guys have fun.  Bye, Robin 
 That does not qualify as something interesting.  You need to try harder. 
 Tell me something interesting...I'm bored. 
 Hey,  I haven't eaten yet either.  Give me a call and we can decide where to meet. 
 How's your day going?  Mine's actually been extremely boring!  If only I could have had this kind of day yesterday I could have actually done my GMAT homework...oh well. 
 Nancy,  The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id. This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not contain positions.  Hope that answers your questions. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today? So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you too!  And I'm not antiromantic...I'm just not as romantic as some people.  It could be worse.  I could be like my mom...she's less romantic than me.  Tambien te quiero MUcho.

 What was she sentenced for? 
 It really makes me think something's up since he's this organized... 
 Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better. I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  Hope your day gets better. Robin 
 Burton,  The book INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  is in the AGG-GASlI portfolio, not in the AGG-GAS III and IV portfolios.  Please add this book to both the AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  Thanks, Robin 
 Strong Drugs!!! 
 We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972 Calladic Hurse.  It's white with orange flames on the front fenders!!!  And it has a huge stereo system in the back.  Now what kind of freak owns something like that and why would you announce it at work? 
 Thanks.  You're the best.  Robin 
 Hey Lynn,  Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a decision made by the end of the week.  Thanks, Robin

 Are you going to be able to leave anytime soon?  If you are I'll give you a ride.  Let me know. 
 Nancy,  The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.

 Well I'm not exactly busy, but I do have a couple of things I could do. Could you do 4:30 or is that too early? 
 What did she say? 
 What's going on?  Are you busy?  I'm going to try to get out of here early again today.  If there's any chance you can get away by 5 let me know and I'll hang out.  RR 
 Stacey,  I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader for this book?  Thanks for your help. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey girl,  I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have some definite plans.  Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off. Robin 
 Tom,  It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected.  Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
 Huh? 
 Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago. 
 Thanks for the update.  Robin 
 Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.   Let me know if you change your mind. Robin 
 You need to quit smokin' crack!!! 
 That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess.  I think our emails must have crossed in the server. 
 Irena,  Someone delivered an envelope for you.  I put it in your top right desk drawer.  Robin 
 Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's really scary.  Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.  I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be specific!!  Robin 
 The FT-NEAST-WH books were set up in the Agg-Gas II portfolio, but never added to the AGG-GAS III or AGG-GAS IV portfolios.  Please add these books under the J_Mrha porfolio in AGG-GAS III and AGG-GAS IV.  Thanks, Robin

 Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman. Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only going to get worse!!

 I'm going home...can you believe it?  Give me a call when you get out of here.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Not yet.  But I haven't given up yet. 
 I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  Now get back to work!! 
 Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, Robin 
 Frank,  I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids.  Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. Robin    Enron North America Corp. 
 What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a while.  Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  Te quiero. Robin

 That was funny...in fact it was the funniest thing I've heard all morning.  I'd rather go to lunch. Thanks anyway though. 
 I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as dedicated as you are. 
 Hey,  It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  Enough whining for now.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Wei,  I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.

 You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges. Let me know when you get them back and we'll go to lunch. 
 Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework. 
 Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled. I'll tell you all about it later.  Do you have French tonight? 
 I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!!  I'll let you know what I find out. Robin 
 You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing is that Emily finally finished high school.  I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly. I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find something out.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Hey,  I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 Lynn,  Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something today?  Thanks, Robin 
 Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway. 
 I'm surprised you invited me to the class!! 
 If you wanted to see me for lunch you should have just said so.  There's no need of going to the extreme of having a Spanish class...people are going to get suspicious.  RR

 I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup. Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we left without you.  Talk to ya later, Robin  Ps  Your boss actually has a reason to be stressed today!!  I wouldn't want to be in that meeting.

 Hey,  Several of us are going to lunch today.  It's kind of a combination birthday party and going away party for Crystal.  Oops I shouldn't have told you she's coming...just kidding.  You're invited if you want to come.  But I understand if you are too busy today to take a long lunch.  Let me know if you want to come.  Robin

 Lynn,  I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the necessary arrangements.  Thank you for your help, Robin 713-345-7478 
 Here is the file that Kori prepared Friday.  Let me know if you need anything else. Robin 
 Any hope yet? 
 Hey Becky,  Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your knee doing by the way.  I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong. And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's actually going to happen.  You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview, much less to live up there.  Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  Robin 
 I'm in no hurry. 
 What's he doing now?  Let me know when you can get away for a second and we'll go buy stamps.  I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about Chicago, so my schedule's pretty flexible. 
 So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let me know if you want anything from downstairs.  No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?  Hope everything gets better. Robin 
 I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story.  He was appropriately disgusted. I'm writing procedures for what I do...ya wanna come help me?

 Harry,  A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday. Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.  Robin 
 Are you sure about that email address???  I sent one and it bounced...or was that just another test?

Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while.  Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.

 It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.  Talk to ya later, Robin 
 You sound chipper anyway.   I'm actually bored today.  We haven't had any problems today.  I'm not used to that so I really know what to do with my time.  That and it's Friday and I don't really want to do anything. 
 How did you get back to your desk that fast? 
 How's you day going?  Mine's much better.  Haven't heard from Canada all day.  Did you come in early today? 
 EFF_DT PORTFOLIO_ID DOWN95 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-COAL 2,542. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-CRD 28,844. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-GAS 1,094,625. 1/11/01  MANAGEMENT-PWR 131,193. 1/11/01  AGG-MANAGEMENT 1,202,894. 
 As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to anyone. 
 So what's the verdict? 
 Kathy,  The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.  Robin 
 Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."  And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian p&l and for the originations total.  Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.  I'll whine more later, Robin 
 I can drive.  So what ever you want.  I was thinking Churassco's, but I'm definitely open to suggestions. 
 Shifali,  Please see the attached email.  If anyone else in your group grants Middle Market Nymex Originations please forward them this email.  Thank you, Robin x57478

 You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye. I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have to work Monday.  I'll talk to ya later, Robin 
 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.  Robin 
 Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.    Enron North America Corp. 
 That's fine.  Just let me know when you want to go.  But give me a few minutes, we're working on something.  It shouldn't take but about 10 minutes. 
 Hey,  How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?  Bye. Robin 
 Beginning this week an Origination report will be given to Fred Lagrasta each morning.  The information for this report is taken from the Origination schedule tab of your P&L file.

There is also additional information that is now required for all Middle Market Nymex Originations.

 How funny is that that I was emailing you at exactly the same time you were emailing me! 
 Hey,  What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring. Anything interesting in your world?  It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.

 I'm gonna have to kill Rock.  He managed to screw up 3 days worth of Basis Reports on Friday!!  How I have no idea.  I had already rolled everything.  All he had to do was query and calc it.  Go figure.  Robin 
 Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you can stop by and visit.  RR 
 I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French?  I'll call you later. Robin

 Monica,  Please include Rahmaan Mwongozi and Binh Pham on the distribution for the Basis Report each night.  Thank you, Robin 
 That would be such a shame if you couldn't go.  You might just have to come with me again.  Just don't go and not be able to come back. 
 What website did you find that cruise on? 
 Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off. I'll just have to stay here all by myself.  If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00.  Bye. RR 
 Ohhhhh.  You have a real problem sending messages to the wrong people, don't you? 
 I dropped it off on my way this morning.   It's really no big deal to drive across the street on my way in. 
 No I mean are you awake or are you just sleeping at your desk.  By the way, thanks for taking the movie back last night. 
 Are you awake?

 No I didn't know...oh well I guess there's always next year.  (Do you feel guilty yet?) 
 Are you just hanging around waiting on me? 
 I can't believe you aren't going to be here for New Year's Eve!!! 
 And I thought you were a nice guy!!  Boy was I wrong! 
 Sorry for kind of cutting you off earlier, but Gossett was hoovering.  It's not exactly career enhancing to make your boss wait.  I'll call you later, Robin 
 What???  I'm confused. 
 What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes the day pass much faster.  Good night. Robin 
 Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a "safe driver."  I'll sleep a little extra for you.  How's everything going this morning? 
 Hey Becky,  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be running marathons by now.  I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  Robin

 Accounting Magic.  Am I good or what? 
 Yeah, give me about 10 minutes. 
 You better decide soon.  I'm only waiting on Canada. 
 Read what Kathy wrote...What am I supposed to go tell Lavo he's wrong!!  I know she's the best risk person we have, but give me a break! 
 I'm low on clean clothes...I need to think if I have something to wear! 
 Try this one.    Thanks, Robin 
 Here's the file from Jeff. 
 So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else. 
 I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago office.  He said it was pretty bad there.  I told him you were headed up there and he said he hoped you didn't mind delays.  Glad you made it safely.  You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores.  Try to stay warm. Robin 
 I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch. If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up for whatever you want to do (within reason that is).  Gotta go Canada's calling. Robin 
 I'm headed to become a "safe driver."  Robin 
 I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's just no pleasing some people.  I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Sorry that
