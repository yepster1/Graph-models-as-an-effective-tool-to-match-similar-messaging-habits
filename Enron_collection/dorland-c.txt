 Mike,  What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. I'll call you one night this week.

 Thanks for your attention but I already bought a vehicle.  Chris Dorland 
 Jill,  All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. Better go but keep in touch!  Chris  5151 Edloe #14306 Houston, Texas 77005  H 713-588-5131 W 713-853-1663 C 713-416-6694 
 I'm glad you had a good time. I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.  cd 
 Ryan,  What's up? Reply to this so I can save you e-mail. I'll write more later.  Chris 
 Jennifer,  I am anxious to get set up on the 401K plan. Who do I need to talk to?  Thanx,  Chris 
 George has Oyster Creek coming back Nov. 25. We have it coming back Nov. 17 on our sheet. Let's assume George's info. is the best.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just a note regarding my plans for Thanksgiving. I am going to fly out the afternoon of Nov. 21 and will be back in the office on Monday the Nov.27. I will need PJB to cover my daily trading on Nov.22.  Chris 
 Did you get her address? 
 That guy has a huge pussy!  cd 
 I think that you should make her something. Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache. I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).  Later skater...   cd 
 Rod,  What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.  Chris 
 Did you send Amanda a card? 
 Hey,  What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...  Chris 
 Rod,  When I am in the US can I buy/sell securities in my RRSP?  Chris

 Tych,  I'm looking for 4 tickets for Friday's Astros game. If you stumble upon any let me know.  Thanx  Chris 
 Stock market is exploding. Dow 11133 (up 260). Nasdaq 2150 (up 60). It has to be higher than where you bought now?  Chris 
 You de man! 
 I have 4 tickets for Friday. I don't know if they are good, bad or what but they are free. Talk to you later.  Chris 
 I would like to move to the Enron Center garage.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 713-853-1633

 How was the Polo match? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale? A little disappointing if you ask me. I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms. A little uncomfortable. Bring on the Advil. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 What's going on? Making some $? I having a pretty good month. What do you think of the stock market? I am practically all cash and Enron. Thinking of buying some TD and Royal Bank. Any great ideas?  Chris 
 You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas? Did she get her flowers for Mother's day? Father's day is coming up June 17. Maybe we should give Dad that Arnold Palmer flag for father's day. Later...  Chris 
 Did you see the quote in the Wall Street journal? Check it out.  Chris

 taking off for the day... give me a shout on my cell  Chris 
 I don't know what my user name an password are for the system.  Chris Dorland

 Any interest in playing golf Sunday with Ryan, my Dad and I ?  Chris 
 Dad,  Please don't forget to make tee times for Saturday and Sunday. I was thinking around noon Saturday and around 4pm on Sunday (Ryan can't make it untill then).  Thanx,  Chris 
 I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know. If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back. Let me know...  Chris 
 Thanx!

 POWER IS JUST AS CRAZY  I HAVE TO GO PUT ON MY RAINBOW WIG AND RED SHOES AND GET BACK TO THE CLOWN SHOW!  CD 
 Kim,  Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan. I haven't received anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up. I would like begin contributing as soon as possible.  Thanx,  Chris  (PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is this correct?) 
 I am not using CQG but I think someone in Canada is using my ID  Chris 
 Some of my questions.  What is the difference between the 401K plan and savings plan?  How much does Enron contribute / match for each plan?  What is the max. annual 401k contribution?  Thanx,  Chris 
 Kim,  Thanx for your help with my parking problem. I will contact Louis and hopefully he can take care of it. Can you give me a call sometime Tuesday afternoon. I have some ?'s about the 401K and savings plans.  Thanx  Chris

 Anne,  I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird.  Thanx  Chris Dorland  (P.S. thanx for the PRC info.) 
 Can you please remove me from this distribution list. I am now in East Power Trading in Houston.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 Anne,  I didn't receive my USER ID for PEP. Do you know how I get it?  Chris

 Happy Anniversary! I will deliver the card in person in about 10 days.  Chris

 H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he trades? Getting busy now better hop.  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Patrick,  Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for you and keep in touch.  Chris

I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week works for you.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland

 FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). Things in Houston are good.

 Gaffney told me to ask you about your dance partmer? 
 Mike  I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing. I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it. Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project. So my answer is I don't know.  Chris 
 Tamara,  Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns. As I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to have my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian returns for 2001. Please advise.  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 Peggy  Could you send the location of the file with the descriptions to Anne Koehler in Houston and cc Nella.  Thanx for your help.  Chris

 Hi everyone!  Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/  Thanx  Chris 
 I can't bomard you with witty remarks if you aren't on IM 
 Are we going at 6 or 6:30. I don't care. 
 I don't need to ask. Every party Dave has is BYOC

We are going back to the Deer tonight and I am going to have some people over tommorow pre-whiskey (around 7:30). You should come by tommorow night. My home number is 214-0454 and my cell is 875-6146. Talk to you later.  Chris 
 I actually invited him thinking there was no way he would come. Damn

 Too bad. Going back to calgary on the 26th. 
 I hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so I thought you might tell her about the kid.  Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario)  Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave)  Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98.  Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99. Did that for a year. Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good.  Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power. Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year. Learned a little bit about trading from him.  You know the rest.  What are her measurements again. 26 36 26  Can that be right?

Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.  Chris 
 Ryan,  Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend. Hope all is good with you and I'll talk to you soon. Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend? If so let me know and I will give you a call.  Chris 
 thanx I have the internet too

 Last trade 0.70. Success has worked for me so far. 
 Sorry to freak on you. I'm a little stressed. Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option. It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you. 
 What press? All the news I've read is great. You're on crack. 
 Did I send you this? 
 That picture is going to occupy most of my day. 
 Did you use a market or limit order? You don't need to lift offers in a falling market. 
 $0.50 last 
 John,  How is Dina doing? Be sure to let us know when she has the baby/  Chris 
 Dave,  I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.  Chris 
 Thanx for only sending the bullish reports. They helped me come in from off the ledge.

 Are you on msn messenger? 
 Enron getting worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Sherry,  This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company.  Thanx for all the help!  Chris 
 THANX 
 You need to get set up on msn messenger. I takes 2 seconds. Ask an IT guy. 
 Apparently I have the wrong number. Give me a call when you get out of the meeting.  Chris 
 Ryan,  What's going on? Give me a call at home. 214-0454  Talk to you later.  Chris 
   PLEASE ADVISE ASAP 
 I'll give you a call later to discuss... 
 Maria,  That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns... just snowballs....  How are things going down there? I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty. Hope all is well.  Chris 
 Tych,  Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.  Chris 
 Nice  Are you going to TO? 
 They are wrong.  Chris 
 I'm in and hopefully I can even find a date.  Chris 
 Did you receive the POA?  Chris 
 Grigs,  I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.  Chris 
 The bonus structure was lined out in detail in a couple of HR video conferences we had with Houston. It is about 10X better than enrons.

 Kiron,  I am not that familiar with the corporate finance side of the business but I will ask around as to who would be a good person for you to contact. You might want to start with Kyle Kitagawa who is a VP in our Calgary corporate finance group. You can reach him at kyle.kitagawa@enron.com or 403-974-6700. Let me know if I can be any further help.  Regards,  Chris Dorland  403-974-6910 chris.dorland@enron.com 
 Thank you. 
 Stephanie  My phone number needs to be changed on the web site. My new number is 403-974-6910.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 I think that show is on this weekend on WTN. After Martha Stewart. 
 Thanx 
 Stephane,  Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone. I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanx  Chris 
 Can you please send her this data?  Thanx  Chris 
  Let's get together this week and talk about our winter forecast for the X. I was thinking thursday afternoon around 2:30. I'll touch base with Holst and see if the west guys can join us via conference call. Let me know if that works for you.  Dorland 
 Tricia,  I was wondering how I get set up with shaw cable internet access. Do you have a number I can call?  Chris

 Hi Vicki,  I did receive it and I will fax it over this afternoon. Thanx for all you help.  Chirs Dorland 
 thanx 
 That is weird. Who would take the time to figure that out?  Chris 
 Looks like bullshit to me. How was the Deer this weekend? What are you doing this weekend? I will probably just be moving all weekend but we should go out next weekend.  Chris 
 Get on MSN Messenger 
 Stalker,  I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke's aquisition of Westcoast. I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization. Let me know when you have got a minute.  Chris 
 Keith,  How was Portland? I'm out of the office moving most of Monday but I'll give you a call on Tuesday. Did you get a chance to drop of my keys at the rental office?  Chris 
 Megan,  I haven't bought a car yet but I will let you know when I get one. When do we get the stalls in E&Y?  Chris 
 Tim,  I spoke with Mike Swerzbin earlier today and he suggested that I get access to your web site. If you could set me up that would be great. Also if you could send me the URL.  Thanx  Chris 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you. I have to run some errands tonight. Give me a shout at work tommorow. 974-6910  Chris 
 If one year ago you bought $1000 worth of Nortel today it would be worth $50. If one year ago today you bought $1000 worth of budweiser, drank all of it and returned the cans you would have $80. 
 Vicki  I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May. I never received the check and am wondering what to do next? The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago. I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have. Please contact me if you need any further info. or with any questions.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 John,  Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of Houston. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A new sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than Enron. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.  Take care  Chris  Chris Dorland 401, 3511 14A St. SW Calgary, AB T2T 3Y1 h 403-214-0454 w 403-974-6910 c 403-875-6146

 Nice!  What's going on? I think my stuff is here on Friday so that means moving in this weekend. We should see if Johnny is going to be around on Friday night. My number at work is 974-6910.  Chris 
 Tricia,  I have completed all the forms you need. Let me know when you have a minute and I will drop them off.  Chris 
 Brad,  Any progress on the direct line with the west desk? If we need to use a different circuit or something let me know. I called Mike Grigsby and asked him to look into it on his end. It is important that we get this line working as soon as possible.  Chris 
 I need that receipt and photocopy asap please. 
 Hi Traci,  I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday. The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!  Chris 
 Mike,  Can you light a fire under the phone guys in Houston to look into fixing our line. I'll talk to our guy and get his gas in gear.  Chris 
 I have transferred to Enron Canada (Calgary). Please forward it to me here.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 403-974-6701

 John  My month to date P&L is incorrectly showing (300K) on the P&L report because they haven't transferred all of the deals out of the BC book into Lambie's book. I am told that this won't be done untill next week? because Brian Gillis is out of the office. Just so you know I back of the envelope calc. my P&L at about 225K MTD.  Chris 
 Untill my shit gets here I am a resident of the Westin hotel.

 That's fine. Thanx for trying.  Chris 
 Carlos  These are the trades I did today.  Bought 5000 gj/d Oct Aeco Fin vs. DI 2.915 c/gj EOL Sold 5000 gj/d Oct Aeco Fin vs. DI 2.955	c/gj EOL Bought 5000 Oct Malin Basis (0.23)  EOL Sold 5000 Oct Rocks (0.485) EOL  and Cowan is working an order to buy 20000 mm/d of Oct Aeco basis vs. DI in us/mm at (0.54)  Thanx  Chris 
 Kim  I briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit A (US salary but in CND dollars) which is incorrect. As I will be in Calgary in Monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to Dawn.  Thanx  Chris 
 How about 2002's? I was just thinking there would be incentives on 2001's.  Chris 
 Dwayne,  As you can Imagine things in the US have been a little crazy which is why I haven't gotten back to you untill now. I will hopefully be in Calgary on Monday and will give you a call then. My office number in Calgary is 974-6910. Are the windows on that truck tinted? 
 Thanx 
 Carlos,  If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it. I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday.  Chris 
 Wayne,  I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland. I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back. Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 3-1663 
 Glad to hear that everything is OK. I will give you a call in a couple of d= ays when things settle down. Hopefully air traffic will resume soon because= I am stuck living in the Hyatt in Houston.  Chris 
 I would like an indoor stall in Ernst and Young. Non-reserved.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Chris,  Can you make sure that the guys in Calgary have access to the new fundy's site. I am having problems getting in.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 Ian,  Forget that last message. Apparently my e-mail just updated.  Thanx  Chris 
 Kim,  I will be on 32 all day. Give me a call or stop by.  Chris 
 Ian,  No luck graphing those spreads?  Chris 
 Carlos,  Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Thanx 
 Ian,  I didn't get yesterday's ops package. Can you make sure I get it today.  Thanx  Chris 
 Ian,  When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points. i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65. Sorry if I wasn't clear. Call me with any ?s.  Chris 3-1663 
 Kim,  I will be on 32 all morning. Come down whenever you get a minute.  Chris 
 Getting closer. I want a graph of the spread not of the 2 fixed prices.  Chris 
 Oct Sumas trades  Sold 50000 mm/d to Lambie (0.24) Bought 5000 mm/d from Chad (0.245) EOL  I also bought 15000 mm/d from Chad today on EOL.  Chris 
 Thanx 
 A couple of other quick things. My October Sumas position doesn't look correct. I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d. I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me. Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Carlos  Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.  Thanx,  Chris 
 How is that ops package coming? 
 Kim,  I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule. I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends. If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday. Let me know when you would like to get together. I am sitting at 3208b.  Thanx  Chris 
 Ian,  Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.  Can you put these graphs together for me.  Nov-Mar Sumas vs. Aeco Sumas vs. Rockies Sumas vs. San Juan Sumas vs. Malin Sumas vs. Socal  Apr-Oct Sumas vs. Aeco Sumas vs. Rockies Sumas vs. San Juan Sumas vs. Malin Sumas vs. Socal  Chris 713-853-1663 
 Judi,  Did you receive a quote for Williams yet? When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move.  Chris 
 Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car.  Thanx,  Chris 
 So much for keeping it quiet. Dorland the loudmouth is back in town. 
 Anna,  I am moving back to Canada to trade gas but I would really like to get your daily technical sheet. Could you e-mail it to me or perhaps start posting it on the commodity fundy's site? Thanx  Chris 
 Kim,  Got the envelope yesterday. Thank you very much.  Chris 
 Mikey,  Dan is going to come to town this weekend. I was thinking of going to the deer on friday and then going out in Calgary saturday night.  Let me know what you think.  Chris 
 Russell,  Can you e-mail me the "model" spread sheet. I want the eol technology.  Chris 
 I just want to print this off. 
 This didn't work for some reason. Can you try to send it again and just copy and paste all the values.  Thanx  Chris 
 Next to Keith Holst if that helps.  Thanx  Chris 
 Kim,  I am sitting on the West desk on 32.  Chris 
 When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears. Keep your eyes open. 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary. I can't wait. Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here. I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's. Black I think. What's new? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary. I am really excited to move into my new place. It is going to be sweet. I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow. Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes? Talk to you soon.  Chris 
 Kim,  Any luck getting this info. for me?  Chris 
 My one year closed interest rate on my mortgage is 5.2%. Not bad! 
 I sold my car. $28000 USD but Enron is going to pay me $3000 USD for not having to move it and get it licensed in Canada. So it cost me $5000 to drive that car for a year. Not bad I guess. Have you and mom had any problems with her jeep?  Chris 
 Mike,  I am not coming to Vancouver this weekend after all. The car I really wanted to look at sold so I am postponing my trip. I will probably be coming out in the next month or so and I will let you know. Take it easy. Do you have John Hughes' e-mail address?  Dorland 
 Glad you like the place. Missed the PS on the first message. 
 I am going to Banff for an off site. I will be back in town the following Friday and we'll do it up that night. Late night Johnny is OK. We'll take it easy as it is a school night. 
 I think I'm going to buy a Grand Cherokee Limited instead of the X5 and save myself 30K. Are we on with Johnny next week? 
 That is great. We were just having a discussion about going to other floors to take a shit because our bathroom is such a dump. 
 What if any changes were made to the Grand Cherokee Limited for 2002? 
 Do you have a number for MSN customer service? I want to cancel my MSN account but have no idea how to get in touch with them.  Chris 
 No luck getting your lease calculator to work? Actually, don't worry about it I have change my mind back to buying. 
 Tricia,  I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.  Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND Duty on this amount = 3300 GST on this amount = 3800 Excise tax = 180 Permits = 400  Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500  That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.  Hardly seems like the best option.  Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:  Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD) Flight = $1500 CND Hotel = $1500 CND October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)  The total of the above is $11 800. 
 Confirm # D5TNLC 
 I'm not very excited to hang out with Mikey all the time. See what Johnny is up to and hit the Benson and Hedges menthol's. 
 John,  Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be:  Movers - $7500 CND Flight - $1500 CND Temp. Accomodations - $1500 CND October Rent - $1500 CND  I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.  Chris 
 What doesn't he like about it? 
 What does the Kergan think of his Jeep? I think I am going to get one of those. Unless you have forgotten the Kergan's where an acient people from the steps of Russia who , for entertainment, tossed children in pits with wild dogs to fight for food. 
 I am going to go home an watch the Austin Power's movies over and over tonight... 
 When I am back in Calgary your whole desk is going to have listen to this shit all day over the box... 
 Lady with python on one side , Star wars on the other... 
 Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that would be a killer ride. 
 We were talking about getting matching PT cruisers with CRUISR1 and CRUISR2 personalized plates. 
 Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I (Enron) would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in import duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits. Looks like I am looking for a new car as well. 
 MTV music awards Thursday September 6th - Hopefully we get another Britney strip tease this year. 
 After the pain in the ass selling my current car is giving me I am thinking about leasing. Can you work up some lease rates for 24 and 36 months.  Thanx  Chris 
 Martin,  I left early yesterday. Does tonight work for you? No spoiler and the car was high and dry during Allison.  Chris 
 Great. I will call you on Sept. 6th when I get to town.  Chris 
 I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary. Let me know if you want to see it. I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.

 Nice looking truck. Is this one the same price? About $45,000? I will be working out of my Calgary office on Sept.6/7. Could you bring it downtown to take me for a ride on the afternoon of the 6th?  Chris 
  Mike,  I don't have your work number. Walker flaked on dinner (did I call that or what). I am coming to town Feb 2. I'll give you a call next week with the details.  Chris 
 Picture didn't come through. Sounds nice. Is there somewhere on the web I can see it.  Chris 
 Do you have a black one in stock? If so, what color interior?  Chris 
 Yeh! Sept.6-7 Try to find a sub. This is Johnny we're talking about. 
 The colors that interest me most are black, silver, white, burgundy and champagne. I will be in Calgary on Sept. 6/7 and I will give you a call. Are you going to be in the office on those days?  Chris Dorland 
 I think we should get him a card and tell him his present will be there when my furniture gets there. 
 Finally got it. Thanx. 
 I am in town next Thursday/Friday. We should do a Thursday night playstation session with Johnny.  Chris 
 How was cottage country? 
 I bought a place in Altadore / River Park. Right near where Blair lives. #402 3511 14a st. SW. Great place and great area. I'll be in the office next Thursday and Friday and then I am back in Houston for a week. Start in Calgary Monday the 17th for good. See you next week.  Chris

 I bought a brownstone in the River Park / Altadore area. #402 3511 14a St. SW. A really cool area and a great place. We will have to grab some sushi and catch up when I get back.  Talk to you soon.  Chris 
 Thank you very much. How long would it take to get something like this in? I will be in Calgary on Sept. 6/7 and will come by and see you. Could you e-mail me your work phone number.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 Brad,  I need to top up my RRSP for 2001. My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881. I have contributed about $5500 through Enron and Enron has contributed $3200 to my pension plan. Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000. The part I wasn't sure about was the pension contributions. Let me know and I will send you a check.  Chris  PS I am going to Vancouver next weekend to look at buying a sweet Porsche 
 Kerrie,  Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron. One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town.  Chris 
 Sorry about the producer recommedation. Still a proud RAX shareholder? 
 Thanx 
 Try to stay away from fried and starchy foods. I'm trying to watch my figure. 
 I just signed and faxed the release of conditions. No getting rid of me now. Hope your girlfriend can cook for 3. 
 Thanx Laura. I need to change about 125-150k USD is that OK.  Chris 
 Tricia,  I think I gave you the wrong fax number for Terri O'Laughlin at the Royal Bank. The correct number is 403-292-2182.  Thanx  Chris 
 Kim,  Any word on what happens to my 401k and/or savings plan when I transfer back to Calgary? Let me know.  Thanx,  Chris 
 I didn't know Blair lived up there. Do you think it's too late to flake on the deal? 
 Got the pictures. Thank you very much. Do you stock those wheels and tires or would I have to order them?  Chris Dorland 
 I am going to Vancouver on Saturday Feb. 2. Check it out on the web at the address below.  http://www.theurbangarage.com/cdetails.asp?CID={7DA68100-EFBB-411F-AD2C-ECF30B22DFB5} 
 I get possesion Sept.20 
 Dawn,  I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today. I wasn't sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent. The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement (3.4) and termination before end of term (2.1). If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter. Let me know what you want me to do.  Thanx  Chris 713-853-1663 
 Purchase. No financing necessary.  Thanx  Chris 
 Where is you place? It is pretty close to there isn't it. 
 Laura,  I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know.  Thanx  Chris 
 Dad,  Just though I would let you know I talked to a Royal Bank credit specialist this morning and he will get back to me this afternoon. I also talked to Jordan and he is going to take call Linda and get going on the paper work. I think I am going to come back to Calgary September 6-7 to finalize everything. There is an Enron Canada offsite in Banff that weekend (Sept 7-9) that I should go to. Thanx again for all your help this weekend.  Chris 
 Nathan / Judy  PWC prepared my Canadian and US tax returns for 2000. I was expecting approx. a $1800 return on my US federal income tax that I haven't received yet. Do you have a number / contact that I can direct my inquiry to?  Thanx,  Chris Dorland Enron North America 713-853-1663 
 A lucent phone will be fine. I will only be on the desk for about 7-8 days so don't go to too much trouble. Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept. 7 ? I will be there that weekend as well and want to coordinate my return with theirs.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland Badge # 25565 3-1663 3116c 
 What are the details of this offsite? Make sure to count me in. Bought a house this weekend. No sense wasting any time. I'll call you later.  Chris 
 I like that area. Nice and quiet. 6 blocks to Original Joe's. Didn't have the carrot cake but the soup was excellent. 
 Mike,  I booked a flight to Vancouver Feb. 2 . I get in at 8am and leave at 6:30pm. Send me your work number and I will give you a call or give me a shout at work.  Dorland 403-974-6910 
 I had lunch at bell's cafe yesterday. They are the red brick townhouses on 14a st. Moving back Sept. 15. 
 Hey there neighbor. Bought a house this weekend #401 3511 14a st. That is pretty close to you place isn't it. You'll have to drive by and check it out.  Chris 
 Looking good. Closed at 40.25 
 Just sold half my ENE's. 
 39.40 TRADES ENE 
 What is the symbol on Rio Alto? 
 Anderson looks pretty good. 
 Whatever. Let me look at them. 
 Buy Gas Producers the AGA just came out and it was Crazy bullish gas 
 Holy AGA batman! That number is unbelievable. Tough to be short now. Keving Presto was short the aga swap at 50 for $60 / bcf. 
 Nice! I think you hang on untill just before it fills the gap in the chart at yesterday's low of 42. 
 Did you buy any ? I have the golden touch. 500 at 37 
 Kim,  I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go. In particular I was wondering what happens to my Enron savings plan (401k) when I go back. Let me know if there is anything you need me to do for you.  Chris 
 The market here for tommorow's close is 36 at 38. 
 The patented move is starting to pay. This just in. Skilling resigns for personal reasons. Wow!  cd 
 What is the specific appeal of distressed debt? If you are going to trade debt or equities GS is the place to be. 
 This just in. Skilling resigns for personal reasons. More to follow... 
 Phil is marrying that chick huh. She is pretty hot from what I recall. I am definately into doing something on Sunday. Give me a call. Have fun this weekend say hi to Darren and Rich and send my congrats (and a shot of tequila) to phil.  Chris 
 Jill,  Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week. Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can.  Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31).  Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination. Or is NY home for a while?  No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.  My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.  How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice. Still don't get that one?  I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch.  Chris  (this e-mail is record length for me) 
 I no longer require help with immigration as I am working in Canada now and I am a Canadian citizen. 
 I just heard from a mutual friend that Kerrie Murray got engaged recently. Scratch that one off the list of possibles. 
 Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things with me are great. Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care. 
 For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work. It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.  Cheers  Chris  P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to feel free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to it. 
 I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle. I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter. 
 Lexus IS 300. Not sure if I am going to buy 17" or 16" wheels for the winter. Jackass. 
 If you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of Dunlop Winter Sport M2 tires. Is you tire guy also a wheel guy? I need some winter wheels as well. 
 Have you guys moved over to the wonderful world of boxes with Enron Canada yet? 
 I was confused by your use of 2 spellings. Did you like my Austin Power's reference? "I know. That's how we do it in Belgium. It's called a Belgium dip" You are back in my good graces. Try not to confuse the dumb fat kid. 
 Fuck you. That's how we spell it in Belgium. 
 Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully moving by the middle of September. Spending Friday house shopping. I think I am going to end up in your neck of the woods. Seems like the best values are in that area. Are we going to get some snow this winter? We need to find Dorland a date. I am going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots of single chicas there. I am really looking forward to being back in Cow town. Houston is painfull.  Later  cd 
 All is good. Just waiting around for my UBS business cards. Not much is new. Might be buying a porsche. Got rid of the chika and am looking for a less bitchy model. Say hi to the boys.  Chris

 Thank you.  Chris Dorland 5151 Edloe St. #14306 Houston, TX 77005 
 Tamara,  Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give you a call then.  Chris Dorland 
 Al,  I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find something that would work. Thanx for your time.  Chris Dorland 
 Hopefully I will be able to make it by then. I have to ta
