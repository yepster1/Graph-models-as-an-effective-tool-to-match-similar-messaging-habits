 Mike,  What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. I'll call you one night this week.

 Thanks for your attention but I already bought a vehicle.  Chris Dorland 
 Jill,  All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. Better go but keep in touch!  Chris  5151 Edloe #14306 Houston, Texas 77005  H 713-588-5131 W 713-853-1663 C 713-416-6694 
 I'm glad you had a good time. I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.  cd 
 Ryan,  What's up? Reply to this so I can save you e-mail. I'll write more later.  Chris 
 Jennifer,  I am anxious to get set up on the 401K plan. Who do I need to talk to?  Thanx,  Chris 
 George has Oyster Creek coming back Nov. 25. We have it coming back Nov. 17 on our sheet. Let's assume George's info. is the best.  Thanx,  Chris 
 Just a note regarding my plans for Thanksgiving. I am going to fly out the afternoon of Nov. 21 and will be back in the office on Monday the Nov.27. I will need PJB to cover my daily trading on Nov.22.  Chris 
 Did you get her address? 
 That guy has a huge pussy!  cd 
 I think that you should make her something. Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache. I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).  Later skater...   cd 
 Rod,  What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.  Chris 
 Did you send Amanda a card? 
 Hey,  What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...  Chris 
 Rod,  When I am in the US can I buy/sell securities in my RRSP?  Chris

 Tych,  I'm looking for 4 tickets for Friday's Astros game. If you stumble upon any let me know.  Thanx  Chris 
 Stock market is exploding. Dow 11133 (up 260). Nasdaq 2150 (up 60). It has to be higher than where you bought now?  Chris 
 You de man! 
 I have 4 tickets for Friday. I don't know if they are good, bad or what but they are free. Talk to you later.  Chris 
 I would like to move to the Enron Center garage.  Thank you,  Chris Dorland 713-853-1633

 How was the Polo match? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale? A little disappointing if you ask me. I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms. A little uncomfortable. Bring on the Advil. Talk to you later...  Chris 
 What's going on? Making some $? I having a pretty good month. What do you think of the stock market? I am practically all cash and Enron. Thinking of buying some TD and Royal Bank. Any great ideas?  Chris 
 You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas? Did she get her flowers for Mother's day? Father's day is coming up June 17. Maybe we should give Dad that Arnold Palmer flag for father's day. Later...  Chris 
 Did you see the quote in the Wall Street journal? Check it out.  Chris

 taking off for the day... give me a shout on my cell  Chris 
 I don't know what my user name an password are for the system.  Chris Dorland

 Any interest in playing golf Sunday with Ryan, my Dad and I ?  Chris 
 Dad,  Please don't forget to make tee times for Saturday and Sunday. I was thinking around noon Saturday and around 4pm on Sunday (Ryan can't make it untill then).  Thanx,  Chris 
 I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know. If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back. Let me know...  Chris 
 Thanx!

 POWER IS JUST AS CRAZY  I HAVE TO GO PUT ON MY RAINBOW WIG AND RED SHOES AND GET BACK TO THE CLOWN SHOW!  CD 
 Kim,  Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan. I haven't received anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up. I would like begin contributing as soon as possible.  Thanx,  Chris  (PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is this correct?) 
 I am not using CQG but I think someone in Canada is using my ID  Chris 
 Some of my questions.  What is the difference between the 401K plan and savings plan?  How much does Enron contribute / match for each plan?  What is the max. annual 401k contribution?  Thanx,  Chris 
 Kim,  Thanx for your help with my parking problem. I will contact Louis and hopefully he can take care of it. Can you give me a call sometime Tuesday afternoon. I have some ?'s about the 401K and savings plans.  Thanx  Chris

 Anne,  I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird.  Thanx  Chris Dorland  (P.S. thanx for the PRC info.) 
 Can you please remove me from this distribution list. I am now in East Power Trading in Houston.  Thanx  Chris Dorland 
 Anne,  I didn't receive my USER ID for PEP. Do you know how I get it?  Chris

 Happy Anniversary! I will deliver the card in person in about 10 days.  Chris

 H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he trades? Getting busy now better hop.  Keep in touch,  Chris 
 Patrick,  Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for you and keep in touch.  Chris

I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week works for you.  Thanx,  Chris Dorland

 FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). Things in Houston are good.

 Gaffney told me to ask you about your dance partmer? 
 Mike  I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing. I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it. Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project. So my answer is I don't know.  Chris 
 Tamara,  Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns. As I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to have my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian returns for 2001. Please advise.  Chris Dorland 403-974-6910 
 Peggy  Could you send the location of the file with the descriptions to Anne Koehler in Houston and cc Nella.  Thanx for your help.  Chris

 Hi everyone!  Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/  Thanx  Chris 
 I can't bomard you with witty remarks if you aren't on IM 
 Are we going at 6 or 6:30. I don't care. 
 I don't need to ask. Every party Dave has is BYOC

We are going back to the Deer tonight and I am going to have some people over tommorow pre-whiskey (around 7:30). You should come by tommorow night. My home number is 214-0454 and my cell is 875-6146. Talk to you later.  Chris 
 I actually invited him thinking there was no way he would come. Damn

 Too bad. Going back to calgary on the 26th. 
 I hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so I thought you might tell her about the kid.  Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario)  Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave)  Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98.  Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99. Did that for a year. Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good.  Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power. Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year. Learned a little bit about trading from him.  You know the rest.  What are her measurements again. 26 36 26  Can that be right?

Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.  Chris 
 Ryan,  Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend. Hope all is good with you and I'll talk to you soon. Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend? If so let me know and I will give you a call.  Chris 
 thanx I have the internet too

 Last trade 0.70. Success has worked for me so far. 
 Sorry to freak on you. I'm a little stressed. Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option. It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you. 
 What press? All the news I've read is great. You're on crack. 
 Did I send you this? 
 That picture is going to occupy most of my day. 
 Did you use a market or limit order? You don't need to lift offers in a falling market. 
 $0.50 last 
 John,  How is Dina doing? Be sure to let us know when she has the baby/  Chris 
 Dave,  I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.  Chris 
 Thanx for only sending the bullish reports. They helped me come in from off the ledge.
