 This guy looks pretty qualified. Who is he? 
 Brian Looks like your Harvard team pulled it off! I know you must be excited about the team. What a great season. Hope you have a good thanksgiving. Kate and I going to OKC and to an OU football game. Take care. Matt 
 Spoke with Dylan a while back and said he took a job with you. Sounds great! He is a great guy and will do well there as you already know. I am off to Mexico for a few weeks starting saturday and will call yo when I resurface in a month or so. Hope all is well. Regards Matt 
 I sent this last week but was to the wrong address. Hope all is well.     Brian, Hi. Hope things are well with you. I wanted to drop a line and say hello as well as to thank you for your extreme generosity   with respect to our wedding. I am humbled by what you are doing for us and know Kate feels the same. I am looking forward to September and know that all will have a great time! Kate and I are going to CT and NY next week to find a place to live (hopefully). We are planning on renting initially then look to buy later. Real estate is crazy there. I guess it is not much better where you are though. Take care. Regards, Matt
