 Davette, Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : )   I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.  Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.  I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.  So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.  That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.  God Bless Each of you and Season's Greetings  Love  Marylyn ________________________________________________________________ GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!

 Did you park at the lot where I normally park?  If so, do you want me to meet you there? 
 Well, why aren't you here?  I'm ready to go!  Of course when ever you are. 
 Lola Willis @ ENRON 02/14/2001 01:52 PM 
 Thank you for the valentines email it is the 1st and only one I've gotten.  I guess you felt bad cause you wouldn't come eat lunch with me.  (Probably Not) 
 Do any of you have Co. 72R  December Journal Vouchers?  I am trying to help Brian Dawson locate it.  Thanks for you help.  dd 
 Did you find the Helen Baylor cd? 
 I've been here since 8:30am but my computer was very slow booting up and after it came on I couldn't get a connection to lotus notes.  I put in a call to Jimmy Manguba, our floor tech, while waiting for my computer to reboot.  I don't know what the problem was but this seemed to work.  dd 
 O://Stfin/ACCNTNG/ 
 That's what I needed.  Thanks! : ) 
 Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.  dana 
 I didn't get whatever it was that you were trying to send me. 
 Brad this file is also located in the O: drive.  Stfin/Accounting/.  Thanks.  Dana 
 Rhonna, Attached is a copy of my resume along with a wealth of gratitude if you could keep me in mind for postings of the nature listed above.  Thanks again.  Dana Davis 
 FYI: The managers also have Co.0919 12/31/00 journal voucher packet too. 
 Hey- Looking at your list below tells me that you filed away Co. 0919 journal voucher packet.  Will you help me find it?  I need to add a voucher to it.  Thanks. Dana    Enron North America Corp. 
 Dorothy -  I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.   Dana 
 FYI: Below is a message regarding the last (2) Cypress wires you gave me yesterday.

 Routing is complete and I am taking your wire to A.P. now.  You should have a copy in your chair.  Thanks.  Dana 
 Brian -  Your wire is awaiting Tim Proffitt's signature but as soon as he has signed his assistant will call me and I will let you know where it is next. 
 Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them. FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts. Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Dana 
 I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules. 
 Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.  Thanks.  Dana

 Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee cause if you go, I GO!  Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last Wednesday.  "DON'T QUOTE ME" Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut off  Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll see you tonight at choir rehearsal.  dd 
 See if you can open these up Tony.  They are real funny video clips.

     Positive Living Tip of the Day Monday January 29, 2001  Your Environment  Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?  If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.  For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life.  - CG, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor

 The original message below in a response to the comments I wrote in Candis' agenda in regards to Wendy Koebernick's email that she sent  yesterday morning titled "Detention Notice".

 I just used all the recon folders for the companies that Kristi just gave me.  I'm going to have Nicole order more tomorrow. 
 Girl, get your butt back in the house and don't come again!  Yes we got your message and there is no problem with you being out. Get some rest and feel better soon.  Dana 
 I'm taking a half day vacation Monday but I will be in after lunch; around 1pm. 
 I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.  Thanks, Dana X3-7520

 I'll be looking forward to receiving that report and thank you for the update.  Mrs. Davis 
 So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this due that paper not being turned in? 
 Oh God Carolyn, Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.  You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.  Love your sister,  Dana 
   Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -  Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.  Mrs. Davis 713 853-7520 wk 281 583-1348 hm 
 I tried to add you to my MSN Instant Messenger service but Enron's email firewall has heightened it's security disabling me to log into outside email accounts.  Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service.  That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there? 
 I wondered whose email address this was when I saw it on one of Uncle Joes emails.  Thanks so much for the E postcards that you sent me.  I guess you have talked to Monte?  Email me back so we can talk.  Oh, I need your physical address so I can send you something.  Love you.  Mrs. Dana 
 Please let me know exactly what paper you are speaking of so that I may address this issue with intelligently.  Thanks for the emails.    Dana Davis 713-853-7520 
 What paper? 
 I am stepping out for lunch right now but when return I will give you a call or an email.  What time is your conference time?  Dana Davis 713-853-7520 
 OK. 
 OK, no problem.  Thanks. 
 OK.  Pat how fast do you need it? 
 Dana, This is for you. 
 FYI: 
 Yes Bobbie, I will confirm that but hopefully not for long.  : ) 
 Yes, I have thought about being an Admin.  I just don't see any entry level administrative positions out there. 
 Dana, This is for you. 
 It wasn't "Shackles" silly.  The 1st song is "What A Friend We Have In Jesus". 
 Do you have any of their cd's?  The one with the song "Shackles"?  I was listening to it this morning and I thought about you. 
 Have you heard of Mary Mary? 
 Davette, Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : )   I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.  Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.  I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation sever
