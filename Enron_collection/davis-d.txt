 Davette, Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : )   I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.  Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.  I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.  So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.  That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.  God Bless Each of you and Season's Greetings  Love  Marylyn ________________________________________________________________ GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!

 Did you park at the lot where I normally park?  If so, do you want me to meet you there? 
 Well, why aren't you here?  I'm ready to go!  Of course when ever you are.

 Thank you for the valentines email it is the 1st and only one I've gotten.  I guess you felt bad cause you wouldn't come eat lunch with me.  (Probably Not) 
 Do any of you have Co. 72R  December Journal Vouchers?  I am trying to help Brian Dawson locate it.  Thanks for you help.  dd 
 Did you find the Helen Baylor cd? 
 I've been here since 8:30am but my computer was very slow booting up and after it came on I couldn't get a connection to lotus notes.  I put in a call to Jimmy Manguba, our floor tech, while waiting for my computer to reboot.  I don't know what the problem was but this seemed to work.  dd 
 O://Stfin/ACCNTNG/ 
 That's what I needed.  Thanks! : ) 
 Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.  dana 
 I didn't get whatever it was that you were trying to send me. 
 Brad this file is also located in the O: drive.  Stfin/Accounting/.  Thanks.  Dana 
 Rhonna, Attached is a copy of my resume along with a wealth of gratitude if you could keep me in mind for postings of the nature listed above.  Thanks again.  Dana Davis 
 FYI: The managers also have Co.0919 12/31/00 journal voucher packet too. 
 Hey- Looking at your list below tells me that you filed away Co. 0919 journal voucher packet.  Will you help me find it?  I need to add a voucher to it.  Thanks. Dana    Enron North America Corp. 
 Dorothy -  I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.   Dana 
 FYI: Below is a message regarding the last (2) Cypress wires you gave me yesterday.

 Routing is complete and I am taking your wire to A.P. now.  You should have a copy in your chair.  Thanks.  Dana 
 Brian -  Your wire is awaiting Tim Proffitt's signature but as soon as he has signed his assistant will call me and I will let you know where it is next. 
 Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them. FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts. Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Dana 
 I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules. 
 Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.  Thanks.  Dana
