 I'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me.  I have a ortho. appt. and I get my braces off. On Thursday afternoon I have to back for my retainers. Can we meet sometime in the morning.  DS 
 Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral. We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances. Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers. If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.  Example:  Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000 ID/1                                                                875,000 ID/2                                                                875,000 (we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.) 
 How long will the unit be down 4 hrs,  8hrs, 12hrs, or all day or longer.  DS 
 We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.  Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.  DS 
 I will be on vacation.  DS 
 I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.  Dave can you do this for us. This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.  DS 
 Ken,  We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.  DS 
 What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me some ideas.  Thanks Ds 
 i will be there  ds 
 I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes. We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen. If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.  Thanks DS 
 fyi  ds 
 Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls.  DS 
 Lindy, You are correct they are physical plant receipt points. The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.  Thanks DS 
 FYI We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.  DS 
 FYI  DS

 This is interesting news.  Thought you might want to know. I sent him pressures on TW side for the month of may per his request.  ds 
 This is TW pressure at the inlet of the Griffith I/C. 
 Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map. Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points. Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them. Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the total Transport Receipt and Delivery. If you have questions please call.  Thanks Ds 
  Subject:  Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers. If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance, let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.

 Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes.   DS 
 Projected flows for Griffith.  Ds 
 You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.  DS 
 Projected flows  DS 
 Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  DS 
 These are pictures of the underground tunnel system.  ds 
 Due to the flooding in Houston there will be no representative available to attend from Gas Control.  DS 
 For Gas Day June 10. Flow                         Nom. 17.200                      19,998 
 I would like to attend.  DS 
 This is a new interconnect into the suction side of WT-1.  I think the capacity is going to be approximately 50,000 mmbtu.  This may be able to flow sometime this or next.  DS 
 This is the schedule that was sent to gas control. 
 yes we control the flow into TW.  ds 
 fyi  ds

 good job!  Thanks DS 
 According to the imbalance sheets we continue to over deliver to the two above mentioned I/C's. We need to short them 3000 a day.  Please build this into your plans.  Thanks DS 
 When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions. Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks DS 
 Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 120,000. After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers. Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send any revisions.  Thanks DS 
 I will be on vacation Friday Oct. 19.  I can be reached at home if anyone needs something.  DS 
 Yesssssssssssssssssssssssss! You may call me at home or page if you need to.  DS 
 Ron we will need to be on the first flight out Monday morning in order to attend the PNM meeting Rick wants us to attend.  DS 
 The itinerary looks good to me.  Thanks DS 
 The attached was posted to the Transwestern's Web Site. Kim would you distribute to your group.  Thanks DS 
  Monday Oct. 29 Gas Day. Oasis will be needing to reduce flows in the early morning hours on Tuesday for approximately 12 to 18 hrs.  I will call Oasis on Monday morning to see if they can handle higher deliveries for the first part of the gas day.  DS 
 Beginning November 1, 2001 Transwestern and Lonestar Gas Controls will no longer be able to use both points to balance. We will need to flow the gas where it is scheduled until further notice.  If any questions please call Thanks DS
