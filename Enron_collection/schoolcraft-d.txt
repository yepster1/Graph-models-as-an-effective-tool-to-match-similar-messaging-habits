 I'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me.  I have a ortho. appt. and I get my braces off. On Thursday afternoon I have to back for my retainers. Can we meet sometime in the morning.  DS 
 Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral. We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances. Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers. If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.  Example:  Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000 ID/1                                                                875,000 ID/2                                                                875,000 (we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.) 
 How long will the unit be down 4 hrs,  8hrs, 12hrs, or all day or longer.  DS 
 We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.  Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.  DS 
 I will be on vacation.  DS 
 I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.  Dave can you do this for us. This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.  DS 
 Ken,  We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.  DS 
 What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me some ideas.  Thanks Ds 
 i will be there  ds 
 I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes. We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen. If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.  Thanks DS 
 fyi  ds 
 Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls.  DS 
 Lindy, You are correct they are physical plant receipt points. The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.  Thanks DS 
 FYI We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.  DS 
 FYI  DS

 This is interesting news.  Thought you might want to know. I sent him pressures on TW side for the month of may per his request.  ds 
 This is TW pressure at the inlet of the Griffith I/C. 
 Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map. Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points. Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them. Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the total Transport Receipt and Delivery. If you have questions please call.  Thanks Ds 
  Subject:  Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers. If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance, let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.

 Please see the attached 
 Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes.   DS 
 Projected flows for Griffith.  Ds 
 You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.  DS 
 Projected flows  DS 
 Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  DS 
 These are pictures of the underground tunnel system.  ds 
 Due to the flooding in Houston there will be no representative available to attend from Gas Control.  DS 
 For Gas Day June 10. Flow                         Nom. 17.200                      19,998 
 I would like to attend.  DS 
 This is a new interconnect into the suction side of WT-1.  I think the capacity is going to be approximately 50,000 mmbtu.  This may be able to flow sometime this or next.  DS 
 This is the schedule that was sent to gas control. 
 yes we control the flow into TW.  ds

 According to the imbalance sheets we continue to over deliver to the two above mentioned I/C's. We need to short them 3000 a day.  Please build this into your plans.  Thanks DS 
 When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions. Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks DS 
 Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 120,000. After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers. Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send any revisions.  Thanks DS

 Station 9 will be unavailable until Monday afternoon, July 23rd.  The recycle valve is leaking gas and a new valve is being shipped from Houston.  If you need a station you have to cycle station 8.  DS 
 Station 9 has been repaired and ready for service as of July 20th.  DS 
 Tuesday or Wednesday works for me.  DS 
 Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2. When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than 140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.  1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000. this is on flow control. 2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We will just have to experiment with the best operation. 3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.)  I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review. If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't know which is the best way to operate.  Thanks DS 
 This is the E:mail we received about the Ivanhoe dehy maintenance.  Will you please respond.  Thanks DS 
 I will be there.  Gary Spraggins needs to be invited.  DS

 When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation. . Example :  Allocations are as follows  The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity) I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity) Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity) Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window) Evening:      Same sequence Non-Grid:     Same sequence  ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated. Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously allocated.  The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes. lets try this for a while and see how it is working. 
 I will be here Tuesday only this week.  Tuesday works for me.  ds 
 After talking with Ken and our Gas Control it appears we had and operater error, a setpoint was put in at the TW mainline.  The problem was corrected and the plant pressure came back.  We think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control we hope to minimize the mistakes.  If any other concerns please call.  Thanks DS  713-853-4299 
 We will need to start operating the Griffith plant TW and El Paso points.  Refer to the previous memo that was sent suggesting the operations.  DS 
 When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point or group comment section in CAS. 1.  Socal Window 2.  Low line pack inventory 3.  I/C or plant non performance 4.  High line pack inventory 5.  Compression status 6.  Other  *During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments. *Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS. *When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.  We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update or allocate. If you have any questions please call me or page.  Thanks DS

 We need to make sure that when we have any issues concerning the Griffith plant we put something on the log. It has been brought to our attention that we had a problem on Aug. 6th and Aug. 14th and there is nothing in the logs about anything.  I was here on the 6th and know they almost ran themselves out of gas because they started pulling more than our setpoint and did not call to let us know.  If anyone can recall what took place on the 14th please drop me and e:mail. Citizens is trying to gather information on these days based on complaints from Griffith plant.  Thanks DS

 Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  DS 
 Projected flows  DS 
 You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.  DS 
 Projected flows for Griffith.  Ds 
 Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team to reverify volumes.   DS

 Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers. If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance, let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.

 This is TW pressure at the inlet of the Griffith I/C. 
 This is interesting news.  Thought you might want to know. I sent him pressures on TW side for the month of may per his request.  ds

 We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections. Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady. Ken, Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant went down. If you have any more questions please call.  Thanks DS  713-853-4299 
 Citizens Griffith Az. I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF)  The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline has been reset at 800#. The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#. Reason:  This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.  This is for our protection.  You may need to raise the setpoint. For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible.  If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.  Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ)  We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.  Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer to the call out list for Citizens.  If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me. The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11. There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.  Let me know what you think of setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control. Reason:  TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith has orders from both pipelines.  Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up some guidelines for us to follow.  Thanks DS 
 FYI  DS 
 FYI We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.  DS 
 Lindy, You are correct they are physical plant receipt points. The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.  Thanks DS 
 Please read I'm sure you will be getting some calls.  DS 
 fyi  ds 
 i will be there  ds 
 What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me some ideas.  Thanks Ds 
 Ken,  We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.  DS 
 I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.  Dave can you do this for us. This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.  DS 
  Check with the plant.  ds 
 I will be on vacation.  DS 
 We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.  Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.  DS 
 How long will the unit be down 4 hrs,  8hrs, 12hrs, or all day or longer.  DS 
 Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral. We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances. Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers. If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.  Example:  Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000 ID/1                                                                875,000 ID/2                                                                875,000 (we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.) 
 I'm sorry tomorrow afternoon is not available for me.  I have a ortho. appt. and I get my braces off. On Thursday afternoon I have to back for my retainers. Can we meet sometime in the morning.  DS 
 This is a new interconnect into the suction side of WT-1.  I think the capacity is going to be approximately 50,000 mmbtu.  This may be able to flow sometime this or next.  DS 
 I would like to attend.  DS 
 For Gas Day June 10. Flow                         Nom. 17.200                      19,998 
 Due to the flooding in Houston there will be no representative available to attend from Gas Control.  DS 
 These are pictures of the underground tunnel system.  ds 
 Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map. Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points. Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them. Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the total Transport Receipt and Delivery. If you have questions please call.  Thanks Ds 
 I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes. We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen. If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.  Thanks DS 
 Gary=20 Gary Spaggins and I have a presentation that we have to give to Stan.  We c= annot attend, Steve January is on vac. There is no one else from our group. 
  Beginning today June 14, 2001  We need to operate the Interconnect points between Transwestern and Northern just like we do all others.  We have orders everyday and we need to balance unless both pipes have agreed to work on the imbalances. When Transwestern or Northern get into operational constraints we need to work with all the Interconnect customers.  If customers are not in the position to help and we have to go out of balance on Transwestern or Northern for operational constraints, please leave myself, Gary or Steve and E:mail or telephone message of all volumes, and why's.  We will need to be able to address them in the morning meeting.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask.  DS 
 Right now I can plan on being there.  ds 
 We need to be able to monitor everything there is to see just as we would monitor a TW on NNG interconnect. Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need  All Accums, (previous and current mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf. on all runs, 2" rotary, 4" turbine meter, 10" ultra-sonic. All available History info..  This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site. Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up.  We need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control.  From what TW is hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week. Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to.  I will be glad to help.  DS 
   Thanks DS 
 Gary Spraggins, Steve January or myself will not be able to participate on the call.  We have a presentation to give to Stan Horton from 9:00 to 11:00.  DS and GS 
 I can be available at 2:00 pm.  Let me know.  DS 
 right now I will be available and very glad to help.  Just give me a call when you are ready and I can meet you in the lobby on 42.  Thanks DS  ext. 34299 
 I will be there.  DS 
 1.  On your first request for down time next week.  You may have an opportunity this weekend 23, or 24 depending on the volumes. We can communicate this to your Team Friday afternoon.  We can not committ to next week at this time. 2.  Your best opportunity to pull your ESD is going to be on a weekend or weekday when or flows are down to the border. We can check every day and let you know when this may be possible.  At this time we cannot committ to your outage requests.  Thanks DS We will stay in touch. 
 It looks like we are over delivering 2000 to 3000 mmbtu/d at PG&E Topock everyday.  I will have the Field go out and take a look at the measurement.  We need to set the point approximately 5000 short every day until further notice.  I will visit with PG&E and let them know what we are doing.    DS 
 Talked with PG&E today and they would like to flow rate today and we can talk to them each day.  Our imbalance is 85,000 mmbtu they owe TW.  I will visit with Mike O'Donnell about our imbalance.  For now use the scada point for daily flow rates and not the spread sheet.  DS 
 It really doesn't matter if we have sold firm or not March is still available for maintenance, as we would do it through april, may or june. To answer your firm question.  Jan. 02 1091, Feb. 1071. Mar. 1071, Apr. 1057, May 1057.  This is what I see right now you know how things change.  DS 
 Can you explain why we over delivered to NNG on total order.  Order: 35.397 to NNG  Flow: 57.753 to NNG  Please let us know.  Thanks DS 
 Disregard the below message.  Sorry about that. I've got egg on my face.  TW did not over deliver to NNG.  The previous day accums for Estes did not role in scada until a little after 10:00 am.  I did call Dale to ask if that should take that long to role over. We are just trying to keep a close eye on imbalances.  DS 
 This will have to wait until March timeframe.  They need to do better planning.   DS 
 Thanks  DS 
 This is special from Christine .  ds 
 Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation.  Please note Rob's message. Gary will you and Tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the Citizens site.  The call will include all the above personnel.  After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything TW can or is willing to do, or is it a Citizens design problem. I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday.  I will be on vacation tomorrow.  Thanks DS 
  We need to watch this real close.  We are scheduled for a conference call with Griffith and Citizens and El Paso. They want to discuss operational scenarios.  Jesse I will let you know when and where so you can listen and add your view points from a gas control perspective.  Thanks DS 
 This is an email sent to me after my conversation with Rob last week.  I don't know where he is leading with this.  However will every one please read the below and Jerry in my absense please work with everyone to try and come up with a solution that TW is willing to live with as we go forward as TW and EMAR (operators for Citizens). Sorry I won't be able to any help this week as I will be traveling to New Mexico for my Mom's funeral.  I will try and stay in the loop as best I can.  Thanks for everyone's help in resolving this issue.  DS 
 I don't know if you got the address to send flowers our cards.  1305 West Jackson Lovington, New Mexico, 88260  Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  DS 
 Thanks  ds 
 It worked.  Thanks ds -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 This is the outage for redrock tie-ins and volumes.  ds 
 As of the 6th TW and NNG are balanced, I agree with Gary we need to stay balanced.  ds 
 This is the most current.  ds 
 The gas temp that gas control see's leaving Roswell (station 9) is running between 85 to 95 degrees.  Please if I'm looking at this wrong please correct me.  Thanks DS 
  Would this be something we would consider or do we need to suggest TW host in Houston.  ds 
 you are correct however there are no nominations.  ds 
 Yes I can.  Let me know when this is finalized.  ds 
 looks good to me.  My portion.  ds 
 We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not need to let this keep growing.  Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.  We need to keep the total order in balance. We will work on this next week.  Thanks Ds 
 I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at the TW afternoon marketing meeting.  ds 
 As of the Jan. 11 Amy got them to take their schedule down from .444 to .088 and TW is now receiving make up.  We will continue to watch this point.  ds 
 I called Steve Richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use.  I told him to get started. This is for unit 602 down from 1/16 to 5/31.  We will still have two units available.  ds 
 next week will be fine.  Let me know.  DS 
 Per Robert Baker:  The TW Valero Pecos I/C unavailable until further notice.  Will keep you updated.  Thanks DS 
 Yes we do and I will make copies.  ds 
 Works for me.  ds 
 I would like to know where and how this is going to affect us and all the parameters.  Kim I know Mansoor is working on the project and I will get with him.  I would like to be included in the discussions from the beginning on new I/C ideas and locations.  DS

 Melissa left a message that the volumes should start flowing to make the imbalance for the month.  They cannot split stream flows.  ds 
 As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.  Gas Control Issues: Nominations: Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements between Duke and PPL. You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics Team.  Flows: We may have to batch the El Pa
