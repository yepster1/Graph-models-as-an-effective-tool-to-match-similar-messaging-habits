Congrats on not choosing a shitty PSU :D


Nice build Turn your PC off what the hell are you doing starting it up without a cooler? 

You can seriously damage your CPU, don't do it Bad SSD and PSU choice, the SSD is really slow compared to other brands/models and the PSU is just really cheap, get an EVGA B2 750W it's only like 44 dollars but it's high quality. Not the best performer, but it's cheap, and it's reliable with only top tier capacitors and 5 years of warranty. The CPU is still more than enough, overclock it a little if you want. The GPU is what's holding you back. The powersupply is also really bad, you should replace that to keep your new GPU safe.That looks like a pre-built system, is it? Because no that isn't very good Which fan is it? I bet it's the CPU fan, the stock cooler is shit. I have a 2500K at 4.8ghz, still kicking ass. My friend has a 6600K, and I slapped my GPU into his PC to check if my CPU was holding it back, and it was, by like 5 FPS.. Yeah the new CPUs are a little bit faster but it isn't worth upgrading to if you have a 25/600K :P

I can help you overclock it if you want, I also have an Asus board so I'm familiar with the BIOS. You're just gonna want to get an R9 390 or something, and a better PSU to replace your current one. A new GPU will pull a lot more power, and overclocking will too, so your current PSU may not be able to handle that. It's not a very powerful GPU but it'll do if your budget is 300 dollars. You can build around it and upgrade it later. Yes please do upgrade your PSU, the one you have right now is an off-brand piece of shit and if it fails under the load of your new GPU you're gonna be sad. 600W is good enough but it needs to be high quality on the insane too. How much are you looking to spend on a new PSU? I'm quite knowledgeable when it comes to PSUs, I think.. LolIt's fine, it can handle the heat for a little but don't do it again, transistors in the CPU can start melting around like 110 degrees I think. Don't quote me on that, though. Just some rough guesses, but an overclocked 2600K will probably draw about 200W maximum and an R9 390 will draw 300W maximum so there's 500W, go for 850 if you ever want to add another GPU (granted you go for the R9 390.

As far as I know, Sapphire makes the best AMD GPUs, and they have great customer support too, so consider that. Don't buy from Asus, their AMD cards are pure garbage.

The powersupply here isn't the most impressive unit, but it's reliable above all things. EVGA cut costs where it mattered the least, that's why this unit doesn't perform incredible, but it is very stable, and reliable with 5 years of warranty. Review of the PSU in my other comment;

http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=393Can't really go wrong with Seasonic, they don't have bad units as far as I know. Not even their 30$ plain silver non modular shitty looking units are actually shitty. Reliable components on the inside. You're comparing a 390**X** to the 970, I meant the 390, no X. 


The 390 is about the same as the 970 at 1080p, but the 390 pulls ahead at 1440p, probably because of its massive 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 970's 3.5GB. It also supports DX12 fully, unlike the 970.https://m.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3ar3zw/amd_r9_390_vs_geforce_gtx_970/No, if it's only for gaming the 6700k is better. Also, 1.4V is too high for Skylake, stick to 1.35V if you want it to lastI'm extremely jealous of those 980s, was your 980 older than 3 months? You could've used EVGA's step-up program if it was younger than 3 months. The powersupply is very bad, if you have 45 bucks to spend get an EVGA B2 750W unit, it's cheap but high quality. Reliable and stable, 5 years of warranty, it's a good unit. 

Edit: Maybe I spoke too soon. Can you upload a picture of the PSU? 4.6 is plenty fast, you'll never notice the difference between 4.6 and 4.7 in terms of speed, but 1.4V is slightly uncomfortable in my opinion. It could run fine for 4 years, but at 1.35V it'll run good for much longer "The main problem with this power supply is voltage regulation. Starting at 560 W, voltages got outside their allowed range, what can make your computer behave erratically. We tested two samples, and both presented the same problem. Therefore, we can\u2019t recommend this unit."

Copy pasted from this review;

http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/cougar-cmx-700-w-power-supply-review/10/


I'd replace it if I were you. How much do you want to spend? I'll tell you what some good units are. Physical size? Yeah, they're pretty much all the same. There's exceptions but nothing you should worry about unless you're getting a really big or a really small unit Umm... Just take any measuring tool and measure how long your case is You can get an equally as good, and much cheaper motherboard for less money. Look at the MSI Krait boards, they're also white and pretty.. 

Corsair CX powersupplies are bad, don't buy them, lemme find you something better. Will edit this comment soon.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/rw9s3C) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/rw9s3C/by_merchant/)

Added MSI Krait board, and a much better PSU. Valley benchmark for the GPU That part list you posted is at least 500 dollars so idk how that even close to fits in your budget. Intel isn't going to happen with only 400 bucks unless you buy second hand, a dual core won't really keep up for much longer. Though you'll have upgrade potential to an i5 later on, so the pentium could be a good idea after all. You realise that there is no pricing on the GPU in that list, right? The GPU is 150$ 

I suggest you look around on /r/hardwareswap and /r/buildapcsales for some good deals, you can get a pretty kick ass computer for 450 bucks if you buy second hand. Definitely worth it. i3 &gt; overclocked pentium any day. Use MSI Afterburner for GPU temperature monitoring and overclocking But you could go for a pentium now, and a better GPU, and then upgrade the pentium to an i5 when you have the money. The pentium will do good enough for the coming year or so&gt;Is the performance bump for Skylake worth the expense of replacing my current 16GB DDR3 with DDR4? I know there are a few boards that will use DDR3 with Skylake, but the choice is limited.

No, absolutely not worth it if you already have 16GB of DDR3, get the 4690K and a Z97 board. The performance difference between that and the 6600K is like 5% or something. And some Skylake boards support DDR3**L**, not regular DDR3.Fair enough, but you should definitely consider buying most of your parts second hand then to get the most out of your budget. 400 bucks isn't gonna get you anything impressive if you buy it all new It probably will, and the difference is 5-15%, so really not worth buying 16GB of DDR4 for. 


http://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_core_i5_6600k-521-vs-intel_core_i5_4690k-412


And I'm not sure about the cooler, look it up :PDangerous? No. A good idea? No. It's not essential to replace but it'd be good to do it. Where do you live? PSUs tend to be expensive in the EU. Alright, then wait a month and check /r/hardwareswap a few times per day for a GPU and some RAM, maybe a CPU / motherboard deal. Doesn't it get destroyed by an i3 in CPU intensive games though? 70 is really low for a CPU, I'd push the OC until it reaches 85 under load, it won't reach over 75 in normal usage then which is good. Hmm. Interesting. Paired with what GPU? Uhhh.. No, i dont think there's a temperature limit where it just bluescreens, my 2500K has gone way over that when my cooler failed :/

Anyway, 85 in prime would not mean that it'd run at 85 in normal usage, at all, more like 70 in real usage if not less. Really? That's cool, I didn't know that. I'm gonna have to look at more benchmarks with the pentium, but I think I remember it falling flat on its face when paired with anything stronger than a 960 compared to the i3..Yeah only change the PSU, the rest is good. Granted the motherboard has a PCI-E, at least 2.0 slot.. Big aircoolers perform better and are more reliable than AIO watercoolers, watercooling is for aesthetics mostly unless you get more than a 240mm radiator. There's also new laptops coming out with super low power cherry picked 980s. No, not 980Ms, actual full sized 980s that perform exactly the same or better than desktop 980s. These laptops usually also have a full blown Skylake CPU in them. Just gonna suggest the MSI Krait edition motherboard, because white case, but other than that it looks pretty much perfect. Good job. Every time I read Australia I get sad because you guys get fucked over so hard when it comes to prices.. One thing to note is that the Micro ATX case may not support your full atx motherboard [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PtKCRB) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PtKCRB/by_merchant/)

I cut some costs on non essential parts, for performance anyway. 

-Cheaper CPU cooler, Skylake doesn't kick out a ton of heat and the Hyper 212 Evo will cool it more than enough even when you overclock it. No need to blow money on a huge cooler. 

-Cheaper version of that motherboard, motherboards don't affect performance at all, it's just about looks, features and reliability, which this cheaper board also has plenty of. 

-Cheaper RAM, still 16GB, high speed, good brand. 

-Cheaper SSD, same size, good brand, high speed, no problem. 

Edit: 

/u/NVSM-Lemonhug's idea is good, take a step back to Haswell and get an i7 4790K instead, it costs roughly the same but will perform much better than the i5 6600K in applications that benefit from hyperthreading, aka having more cores. An i7 basically just fakes having 8 cores so programs use it more efficiently, or something something pipelines whatever.

This is what I came up with. 

-An i3 is essentially a quad core, it's much faster than the FX 6300 in almost all applications, and especially games. 

-Cheap but decent motherboard by MSI, they have good service. 

-RAM is pretty much all the same granted it has the same specs.. 

-Cheapest decent SSD and HDD I could find. 

-Much more reliable 80+ Gold Seasonic PSU, don't let its outside appearance fool you. Seasonic makes proper quality stuff, they cut the cost where it matters least, the looks and modularity etc. 

And finally, the GPU. I went with EVGA here in the hopes that you can make use of their step-up program, but I'm not sure if that's available in Australia. If it is, basically, within 90 days of purchase of your GPU you can apply for a step-up, you'll be put in a queue and when your request is processed you will send your GPU back to them, and pay the price difference between your GPU and the step-up GPU, so you can buy a 750Ti now and step up to a GTX 960 or something in 3 months by paying the difference between the two. I suggest you go with a cheap-ish MSI board because of their customer support, and get a dedicated RAID controller. Look into the MSI Krait boards, they look amazing I think. If you like white anyway. 80 is too high, it won't damage your CPU, but Xeons are low power chips so they shouldn't get that hot. I think your failed attempt at pulling the cooler off caused a lot of air bubbles to form in the thermal compound, so pull it off and reapply. The stock heatsink is a little stupid to get off, try twisting and pushing/pulling the pins until it pops off, or breaks. Either one, lol.. 

Edit: Chips, not chops.. Lol.. Chop Chop Chop. EVGA. 

Just because of their amazing customer service, they're known to replace dead cards without any questions and sometimes they even replace your card for a more expensive one. 

How much do you want to spend? And if you're interested in upgrading your card within 3 months EVGA is the obvious choice, their step-up program is awesome. Yeah you can. What powersupply do you have? You really don't want to run an expensive card off a shitty powersupply, it could break it. The specific kit of DDR3 I have in the i7 4790K build is actually faster than the DDR4 kit in the 6600K build. DDR4 runs faster at lower a lower voltage, meaning that it's just more efficient, but DDR4 at 2133mhz is slower than DDR3 at 2400mhz, it's just more expensive because it's new, DDR3 has been around for nearly 10 years I think. You won't notice a difference in RAM speed anyway, only benchmarks and super RAM intensive programs notice a difference. To answer your other comment; don't worry about what hyperthreading is or does. Just take the simple approach and think of it as more cores, or a more efficient way of handling work. The Haswell i7 will be faster than the Skylake i5 in any program that can utilise more than 4 cores, and in programs that use less than that the performance will be the same thanks to the higher clock speed on the i7. Of course this changes slightly when overclocked, but the difference won't be noticeable. The i7 is a better buy overall, and you won't have to upgrade your CPU for at least 5 years. By that time a new socket will be out already, and Skylake will be just as outdated, so there's no real reason to go with Skylake right now. 

Cases, ehh... Pick one that looks nice is all I have to say, just go onto pcpartpicker, select any ATX size motherboard, go to cases and make sure the compatibility filter is enabled, and then start watching reviews. How much do you want to spend on your case? The cheapest one. 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-04gp43975krPretty much, but it should pop off if you twist/pull the pin a certain way without *too* much force.  You can buy a decent cooler for like 15 bucks so if it breaks it's not the end of the world. 

Edit: I need to learn how to read. Yeah you can use it till Saturday, permanent damage doesn't happen instantly until like 110 degrees, but 80 isn't good and running it like that for months could reduce its lifespan. A few days isn't a problem though. You're fine. Just replace that thermal paste soon. Yes, easily, but I suggest getting a NH D14 or 15, they're a little bit more expensive but they're absolutely dead silent, and they even beat the Corsair H110 in cooling performance. i3 or i5 if you can find a deal.

Is much better bang for your buck, but since you don't play demanding games you may as well go for the R9 380 instead and get 16GB of RAM as it sounds like you enjoy doing a bunch of things at the same time. I find myself filling 8GB of RAM up from time to time. Looks like a good board, but sadly I don't know anything about RAID controllers other than the fact that they exist, sorry. You could order the board, update the BIOS to the latest version and check if your RAID setup works okay, and order the controller later if necessary. Maybe contact MSI about it directly, they have great customer service and I'm sure they wouldn't mind talking to you about it if you called them. Liquid cooling really isn't worth it unless you do it for aesthetics. Higher failure rate, more noise, less cooling performance per dollar, and risk of leaking and destroying your components. Take a look at the Fractal Design Define S in white, and the NZXT S340 in white. 

Do you need WiFi? Most motherboards don't support it natively. Get the 390 instead if you can afford it, it's much more powerful, but you don't play hugely demanding games so you can go with the 380 no problem. 16GB of RAM is always a good idea. Awesome :)

http://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/define-series/define-r4-arctic-white-windowThat's a locked CPU, get the K version of the 4790. 4790**K**i3 has 2 cores and hyperthreading, so it's basically 4 cores, and it performs much better than an AMD 6350 6 core in games because games favor strong single core performance, and the i3 performs about 20-30% better in single core applications like games. The i3 won't be far behind in other tasks either, as most programs are limited to using one or two cores, and when you have a program that can actually use all 6 cores of the AMD CPU it will only perform about 20% better than the i3. The graphics card link is dead. Why is there never any love for AMD in extreme budget builds? Please, guys, this isn't a gaming build. It's not going to benefit from the Pentium's 2 strong cores, that thing only has on board graphics capable of handling some youtube videos. It needs a GPU to do basically anything even somewhat graphics intensive. This AMD APU performs much better than the Pentium when it comes to game performance, and the Pentium's strong single core performance isn't necessary here, so I think this is overall a better build..

Feel free to go for a cheaper PSU, but this unit is reliable and you'll be able to add a decent GPU later on as long as it isn't too too power hungry. Definitely upgrade that first, it's pretty much a piece of shit. Can your PSU handle a new GPU? Aesthetics. It's locked, that means it cannot be overclocked. Not saying that you necessarily have to overclock it, but having the option to later on is good. The unlocked chips also come with a higher clock speed out of the box (without having to overclock), so they're a bit faster than their locked versions anyway. 


Be extremely careful with the window on the S340 btw, it scratches very easily. Not that I can think of right now, wanna have a quick chat via Telegram? Go over all your parts, sanity check and all that. My name on there is the same as it is here. Telegram is a messaging app, I think it's available for every platform. Definitely do make another post, or contact me, before buying. And keep an eye on /r/buildapcsales and /r/hardwareswap for good sales or brand new in box with warranty deals I'm off to sleep, cyaYeah your motherboard will do fine They're such low power chips that it's actually not that bad Well powersupplies lose a little bit of their wattage over time, and some really bad units actually can't even deliver their full wattage.. What brand / model is it? Beautiful build, great job, but the PSU makes me sad :( Why would you power such expensive hardware with such an unreliable piece of shit powersupply? It's not very common, but it's even less common on high quality units so why wouldn't you get one? They're not that expensive. What powersupply is in it anyway? If you have a 1000$ budget just go ahead and get an EVGA 980 Ti and a good CPU cooler so you can overclock it a little bit as it's not the best performer around, but it'll do. If you're okay with buying second hand, check /r/hardwareswap for a good ~100$ GPU deal. You can get a pretty powerful GPU for around 100, something like a 7970 (280X/960 performance) goes for that price. CS/CX/VS series are all pretty bad, still a great build though. How much did those custom cables cost you? &gt;I've read that dual-channel 2x4GB can be faster than 1x8GB RAM, so I left that unchanged (or am I wrong about that?

While this is True, the speed difference is so tiny (&lt;5%) that it really doesn't matter, your motherboard only has 2 RAM slots, so filling both will lock you into 8GB and you'll have to sell your kit and buy a new one if you want to upgrade to 16GB, so getting a single 8GB stick now is much easier, as you can just slap another 8GB stick next to it and have 16GB without throwing anything out. 

&gt;I kept the storage the same, as I see no upside to OCZ compared to Sandisk.

Get whatever is cheaper, as long as it isn't Kingston. Their SSDs are shit. 

&gt;I wanted a 500W PSU just in case and I'd also like the PSU to be modular (but semi-modular will do) - at MSY, I couldn't find a SeaSonic like that for the price you listed

The Corsair CX/CS/VS units are really bad, could you send me a link to the store you're buying from? I'll take a look at what the best powersupply is for ~100 AUD. 

You wanna continue this on Telegram? Easier chatting through there. My name is the same so I should be easy to find.That's not too bad, do they ship to the Netherlands? I'm planning to rebuild my PC in a different case, and I'm going for a white/gray color scheme, I'll spray paint my motherboards shroud (Asus Sabertooth "thermal armor") white and get matching cables, I think that'd look good. They are, go watch some reviews :P

As long as you don't game on battery power you're all good. Don't worry too much about motherboard compatibility, a 100$ GPU isn't powerful enough to max out PCI-E 2.0 8x bandwidth, which almost all boards will have. I won't be able to do it for a good while, maybe after Christmas, but when I do do it, I'll post it. Don't you worry :Phttp://www.msy.com.au/nswonline/pc-components/8578-antec-hcg-520-high-current-gamer-gaming-psu.html

This is manufactured by Seasonic, good unit. And you really, really won't notice the difference between 2x8 and 1x8GB of RAM, just don't lock yourself into only 8GB, in case you decide that 8 isn't enough after a month of owning the machine. I find myself running out of 8GB quite often. Modularity is nice, but not necessary. You can tuck all your cables behind the motherboard tray and say goodbye to them, it's a bit more work but in the end I wouldn't even consider sacrificing reliability for modularity. 

Edit: Seasonic and Superflower are the main manufacturers for high quality PSUs, they make units for lots of companies. 

Almost all XFX units are Seasonic. Contact MSI directly with those pictures and see what they say. Just call their customer support. It's all in the manuals, and there are dozens of build guides on YouTube. 8 pin connector on the motherboard is CPU power, and the GPU does indeed need 2 cables coming straight off the PSU, probably labeled VGA or GPU or something. This sub needs a sticky recommending against Corsair CX PSUs. What are some Brazilian online stores? I'll look for a better PSU around the same price. Looks good, but maybe go for an MSI board instead. I like their customer support. The cables should be labeled unless the Corsair RM series is worse than I thought, and it's okay to daisy chain hard drives off a single sata power cord You have to upgrade that to add any GPU at all. How much do you want to spend on a powersupply and how long do you want it to last? You're so thick headed it's unbelievableNo that's a huge budget, I'd say get an EVGA G2 850W, that'll run any quad core CPU + 2 GPUs and it'll last for at least 10 years. (it has 10 years of warranty) 

Get one of these 3, 850W is enough for most builds but with your budget I would say why the hell not to the 1000W. The G2 is better than the GS.

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g11000vr


http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g21000xrThat is beautiful. Why the Corsair PSU though? Whyyyy :(

Love the cable extentions. But the EVGA one performs better :( And the warranty is much longer :(


Nice build anyway, and the RM series is pretty decent. :PReturn it, gigabyte makes shitty AMD cards, and so does ASUS. Get one from Sapphire or MSI instead, they have good performance and good customer support. If only EVGA made AMD cards.. I read that they fucked up the R9 series, they used a subpar power delivery system, only 4+1 phase, while the reference design is 5+1 phase. The XFX R9s really do not like being overclocked at all because of it. My condolences, that's a very sad way to go out. Beautiful build though. You can even have 4 GPUs, but performance scaling is garbage with more than 2 cards. 2 is the furthest you should go. 1. No

2. No 


Lol, make a build ready post here with you parts whenever you're ready to purchase No, if you're willing and able to spend that much you should just get a new motherboard and CPU along with a single 980tiIf you don't want your computer to blow up, don't get a Corsair PSU. Get an EVGA GS or G2 series PSU instead. G2 is better than GS but both are good. 

The external audio thing should work, and any AC WiFi card will do. Wait what...? Upgrading from a 290 to a 390 will give you like 3 more FPS, there's no point at all. Wait for the next generation of GPUs. The 390X beats the 970, and the Corsair PSU is bad. Get an EVGA GS or G2 series instead, G2 is better than GS but both are good Oh, then I guess maybe, but I'd still wait for next gen The 980 Ti owns the Fury X in pretty much all benchmarks I've seen. Benchmarks as in real games tested by reviewers on both cards. 980Ti wrecks the Fury X almost every time. awesome, don't forget to wipe your amd drivers before installing your new GPU. Amd driver is gonna fight the nvidia card and it's just not gonna work. Use a driver wiping program to wipe the amd GPU drivers and then install your nvidia card and install its drivers Yes, processors don't need drivers and aren't dependant on the GPU So let me get this straight.. You got a amazing 2600$ computer, but one of the shittiest and most over priced powersupplies..? Why? Why does everybody go for the shitty Corsair powersupplies without researching.. You could've gotten an 80+ Gold 850W EVGA unit with 10 years of warranty, but instead you got an 80+ Bronze Corsair piece of shit with 3 years of warranty.. 


Nice build, it looks awesome, but you could've gotten better components for that amount of money :(Those tests were flawedThis build really doesn't make a lot of sense, way overpriced motherboard, way overkill CPU cooler, way too shitty PSU and a weak GPU.. 

If you want this to last for as long as possible, you have to get a better PSU. The Corsair one will likely fail after 4-6 years if not sooner. VS/GS are also shit, and RM is only average. Point being, you can get a 
 better PSU for the same price as almost any Corsair PSU. Only their AX/HX units are really worth it if they're on sale. The AX units reign supreme when it comes to performance, as far as I know they're the best you can buy, but you can get a unit that has longer warranty and performs ~1% worse for like 50 bucks less, so what's the point.. See my other comment above yours. 

Corsair's CS/CX/VS series have always been shitty, they still are. Overpriced pieces of garbage with short warranties and average performance, you can get much better for less or equally as much money. Here, this makes a **lot** more sense, I changed the motherboard to a good MSI board, MSI makes high quality stuff and their customer support is great. 

Changed the cooler to a Hyper 212 Evo, if you don't overclock, that'll probably keep your CPU under 60 degrees at all times, which is awesome. Skylake doesn't produce a lot of heat. 


Changed the RAM to a 2x8GB (16GB) kit, I don't think you'll ever use more than that, but if you do you can easily add another 2 sticks and have 32GB.

Added an SSD, this will really help to make your computer a lot faster, and stay fast over time. 

Changed hard drive to a WD Purple, the WD Purple series is meant for 24/7 operation in shitty environments for surveillance cameras and such. It's reliable and fast, exactly what you need. 

Changed the GPU to an MSI R9 390, as I said before, MSI has good products, and good warranty in case something happens. The 390 will last much longer than the 380, and you likely won't have to upgrade it for a looooong time. 

Changed the case to something a bit more elegant looking, Phanteks makes high quality cases with good airflow and well thought out design. 

And last but certainly not least, the most important part of your computer, the powersupply. You really, really do **not** want a cheap powersupply in an expensive rig that's supposed to last long. I couldn't find the EVGA G2 series for a reasonable price on the German pcpartpicker, so if you can find that then get it instead, but this Seasonic Gold unit should last you for 10 years without any problems. Seasonic makes incredibly high quality and reliable stuff.

I got it on sale, so I thought why the heck not, and this was 5 years ago when I wasn't all that knowledgeable. Could I have gotten something better? Yeah, probably.. Was this a good buy with the 40 euro discount? Heck yeah. I also live in the EU, Netherlands to be exact, and the powersupply choice over here is extremely limited. If I want EVGA I have to import it from the UK, and the rest is just extremely over priced..It is actually *bad*, though. Low quality components, and a really short (3 year) warranty. Why do you think that warranty is so low? Because Corsair knows it won't live much longer. That's garbage for 120 bucks.. Uhh... What? It's Skylake and NVIDIA, those are the least power hungry things :P 

Skylake CPUs are the most efficient CPUs yet, overclocked to the absolute max the 6700K + motherboard, RAM and a hard drive only draws 180-ish watts, and a 980Ti uses less lower than an R9 390, which is under 300W, which is insanely low for such a powerful GPU. This rig won't draw more than 500W under full load. Even 500 would be fine, but having a bit extra to add another GPU in the future isn't a bad thing, right? :P Read the comments in this thread and you'll get a lot of information about this build. Make a Build Ready post before buying, we'll have a final look to see if anything is wrong :) That CPU will barely even bottleneck SLI 980Ti's, don't worry. Any Malaysian web stores I could look at? Putting something together on pcpartpicker is probably useless because most of the components won't be available where you live. I have nothing bad to say about this build, solid choices across the board, but I have 2 suggestions anyway. 

A way sexier white/black motherboard by MSI, I think this would look awesome paired with your white/black CPU cooler. MSI customer support is way better than Asus' anyway, so it's overall a better choice in my opinion. And I switched the SSD for a slightly cheaper one, to save a few bucks, but it doesn't really matter. They perform equally in regular usage.

1. Get cheaper RAM, RAM speed really doesn't matter at all. You won't notice a difference in 99% of all programs, money is better spent elsewhere. 

2. i3 &gt; any AMD CPU for gaming 
So? Still less than 200W for an overclocked 6700K + motherboard + RAM + HDD. That's not "very power hungry", have you ever seen the power consumption of AMD CPUs and Intel Extreme CPUs like the 5820K and 5960X 

And anandtech used a 2013, very power hungry overclocked extreme edition 6 core i7, and that link you posted is **total system power draw**, the GPU itself probably only used 250-300-ish watts Will it need WiFi, or is cable okay? http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16811147236&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-PCPartPicker,%20LLC-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566

Much more reliable powersupply, and a better GPU. Listen to /u/djlewt he knows what he's talking about. The server grade support is worth **so much more** than saving a couple hundred/thousand bucks, trust me. You should be able to overclock that CPU to ~4ghz, which will make it fast enough to keep up with nowadays games. The RAM is still good, I'm curious about the powersupply.. What is that? 


Buy a good cooler, overclock your CPU and upgrade your PSU. You can move the multiplier up a little bit, but you can't go to like 4ghz or higher. -Much better CPU, overclock it to 4.5ghz (easy) and it'll kick ass for 5+ years. 

-More value minded motherboard. Still good quality. 

-Better GPU. 

-Much better PSU, beside being higher wattage (850W is enough to Crossfire R9 390s later on) it's also higher quality, and it has longer warranty.

Get something like an R9 390X or a Fury X, that'll play anything at 1080p almost maxed out right now, and it'll continue to get decent FPS for at least 5 years. You'll have to drop the settings as time progresses, but it'll still be a decent GPU in 5 years. Okay.. Why are you telling me? :pAwesome purchase, you'll love it for the next 15 or so years unless you're insane and go for triple 3 cards :pYour RAM is still good, so that's something I guess. You can re-use your case, and probably your Windows licence.. You could put together a much more powerful build than what you have right now for like.. 400 bucks, if not less, but you could also just replace the dead parts, your CPU is still pretty okay so it should be fine for another while. What? No, no no no no.. His motherboard isn't compatible with any even somewhat recent CPUs what are you talking about.. /u/ert1233


Edit: I'm stupid, he asked if it was compatible with general parts, I thought he asked about CPU compatibility. Nevermind.  It was clear enough, I'm just an idiot.

-Cheaper but equal quality motherboard. 

-Little more expensive CPU cooler, but it's a bit smaller and performs a bit better. 

-2x8GB RAM instead of 4x4GB just so that you're not locked into 16GB, and can simply add more sticks to upgrade without having to sell your old kit. 

-Much better cooler design 980 Ti, the FTW edition is awesome, and it has a sexy ass backplate. You can save 10 bucks and go with the SC+ Backplate edition cooler instead, but the FTW is better, so why not. 

-An in my opinion much, much nicer case. It is a bit more expensive, but it's much better build quality. HardwareCanucks has an amazing review on it, and the Window actually passed the nail scratch test. Wow. Great quality. 

-And a much, much better PSU. 750W is enough to run 6600K + SLI 980Ti's and the EVGA G2 series come with 10 years of warranty, very reliable. &gt;reducing life of compomemts by overclocking

lol 



Anyway, umm, I can't really answer this if you don't give me a budget. If you live near a micro center just get everything you can find there, it's so, so much cheaper.

-Changed the CPU, same price but little better performance. 

-Changed the motherboard to a way cheaper Asus (ASRock is owned by Asus) H97 board. 

-Left the RAM. 

-Changed the SSD to a higher capacity one, for less money. Idk how the heck you found that 60GB one for 80 bucks. 

-Upgraded the GPU to a 960

-Upgraded the PSU to a 520W model, this way you'll be able to run much more power hungry GPUs in the future. Your original choice was good, too, thank you for not choosing a freaking Corsair CX piece of shit. Don't bother upgrading to another AMD CPU, if you upgrade, do it properly and get an Intel CPU, wait for a motherboard + i5 cpu bundle deal and pull the trigger. Yes, typo :P The newer cards from AMD are headed in the right direction, the R9 Nano for example. I know they're cherry picked chips, but still, it shows that AMD is in fact capable of producing an efficient GPU. I have high hopes for the next generation of AMD stuff, granted it'll actually be on a new architecture. Huh. I didn't think there was any difference between the 'i' units other than the Corsair link functionality, guess I was wrong. Good to know. Whatever is cheaper, both are great options. You can re-use your RAM on 1150Hmm. I didn't know that about the  Fury. Xeons can overclock? The RAM speed your board says is the max it can support, yeah. 

An i3 is, infinitely worth it, wait a little while longer until you can afford it. It performs much better than the 860K.That's really low, it uses more than that. Somewhere around 150W. Air cooling is far superior to water cooling, unless it's a custom watercooling loop. Air is more reliable, can't leak, performs better, is quieter, is cheaper, the only con is that it looks worse. 

Edit: Why am I being down voted? Do a simple Google search and you'll see that I'm right. One of the rules of this sub is to not down vote based on disagreement. Grow up, kids.. No need to apologise, come on :P 

Replacing the CX for an EVGA GS/PS/G2/P2/T2 series, CoolerMaster's V series, XFX Pro series, Superflower Leadex Gold, Platinum or Titanium series or anything by Seasonic is definitely a good idea. The G2/P2/T2 series are the best units you can currently buy, as they have the longest warranty (10 years) and are therefore the most reliable in my book. Amazing performers as well. 

[jonnyguru's G2 750W review](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=380) (jonnyguru is a hugely respected professional powersupply reviewer) 


[P2 650W review](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=446) 



Aaaand the Titanium line only has a 1600W version, so don't bother, but this one basically got a 10/10 rating, if it wasn't for the soldering screw-up on that particular unit. [T2 1600W review](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=410) Rest in fucking peace, 3-6 hours of down time per month is insane, even per years it'd be more than you can expect from a proper server setup. Must've cost him at least a few thousand bucks every time it went out, assuming 35 people actually do useful work.. The cost of a proper server wouldn't have been more than 10-15,000.. Infinitely worth it. Just stop, man, admit your mistake and do your company a favor, don't build them a server. It's a terrible idea. Sorry to be so blunt, but you seem a little hard headed. It's a bad idea, period. [PCPartPicker part list](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/Vjd6Hx) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/Vjd6Hx/by_merchant/)

Is this too close to \u00a3700? I managed to fit in an R9 390 which is much more powerful than the 380, obviously. You could cut some minor costs on other things, like a cheaper motherboard. Do you need something that the H97 chipset offers or is B81 alright too? You can't compare AMD with Intel, AMD has more weak cores while Intel has fewer but more powerful cores. 

An i3 is 2 cores + hyperthreading so windows will see it and treat it as a quad core, it essentially is kind of a quad core and it destroys the 860K in gaming thanks to its stronger performance per core. Games favor single core performance. That's interesting. Are Xeons that old worth it though? I can't imagine there being anything even somewhat recent available for such an old platform. Everything looks pretty good, but are you sure you want such a childish looking case? Lol. I bought the same one a few years ago and I hate it now, beside that it's not a very good case in my opinion.

The EVGA NEX series is old and doesn't perform very well, go for the GS/G2 series instead Yeah, a 980Ti is way too powerful for 1080p, even at 1440p it can max any game out with 60+ FPS minimum  but it's good to have it anyway so that you can upgrade your monitor later and not have to worry about whether or not your GPU can handle it. What website are you talking about? Pcpartpicker? There's a ton of great cases on there, what're you on about? :P

Edit: whoa, what do you need 32GB of RAM for? What's this PC gonna be used for? [PCPartPicker part list](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/dgVYjX) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/dgVYjX/by_merchant/)

-Changed the RAM to a 4x4GB (16GB) kit, because I can't imagine you ever using 32GB, what would you need 32GB for? 

-Changed the cooler to the H105, somehow it performs better and is cheaper than the 110. Don't ask me why, I know it doesn't make sense. 

-Changed the case, Phanteks makes really high quality stuff, and this case looks nice without being too huge. 

-Changed the powersupply to a 650W G2 unit. Trust me, unless you do some **serious** multitasking and video editing, you will not run out of 16GB of RAM, really. If you ever do, you can easily add another 4x4 set and it'll be the same price as if you buy it outright, but this way you don't waste money on something you probably won't even need. If you have the money, then by all means, go for it. But in my opinion that money is better spent elsewhere. If you end up needing more than 16GB you can just buy another one of the same 4X4GB kit and your total will be \u00a3172 which is lower than you were originally going to pay for the 32GB G.Skill kit. Get the 970, \u20ac270 is an awesome deal and the G1 gaming is an awesome card. Sapphire or XFX for the 280X and EVGA or MSI (preferably EVGA) for the 960.

If you want to upgrade your GPU in the near future (within 3 months of purchase) go for an EVGA 960 and use their step-up program to upgrade to a 970 or 980 or something. you can't overclock a xeon, only the K or X chips can be overclocked. Don't only use mindfactory, use de.pcpartpicker.com. Hold on, I'll have a look. Get either this MSI card (MSI has great customer support)  


http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-gtx9602gd5toc

Or this Powercolor card (I'm not sure about their customer support. Some say good, some say bad.. Idk..) 


http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr9280x3gbd5t2dheoci5 4690K280XASRock H97 anniversary edition is good and cheap. Get another PSU and test it, if it works fine, I have another reason to talk shit about Corsair CX garbage PSUs, if it still doesn't work I'm still going to talk shit about them because they suck.

-Liquid cooler will look much better in a small form factor build like this, and it'll perform great.. 

-Motherboard with WiFi build in

-Nicer looking blue RAM 

-Faster WD Black drive, if you don't want an SSD (I really recommend you do get one), at least get a fast hard drive. 

-FTW edition EVGA 970.

-Much higher quality and in my opinion better looking case. It's available in black, gray and white. Watch some reviews, Hardwarecanucks has a great video about it. It's a beautiful little case. 

-Higher quality and 80+ Gold certified PSU. (Seasonic is the OEM, so it's good quality. You can read jonnyguru's review about it if you want.)Enermax has some decent PSUs That reason is aesthetics. The Noctua NH-D15 performs on par with every 240mm or smaller AIO watercooler. Watercooling only makes sense for aesthetics or if you're going for a bigger than 240mm radiator. I don't need sources because a simple Google search will confirm what I'm saying, big air coolers perform amazingly well, are much more reliable, quieter, and they can never leak. Not that that happens a lot, but hey. 

Edit: sources 

[Oooh, a 4 degree difference. Maybe the reviewer only used 1 of the fans, I don't know.](https://tpucdn.com/reviews/Noctua/NH-D15/images/CPU_OC_typical_a.gif)

[And here's the dual fan NH-D15 within performing the same as more expensive AIO watercoolers.](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/noctua_nh_d15_review,11.html)

Can we not forget that the NH-D15 is going for $95-ish, while the Corsair H105 and H110 cost $100 and $110 respectively? And the NH-D14 performs the same as the NH-D15 and only costs $75 right now. Just look at my edit, and stop down voting me because you disagree with me. It's childish. I provided sources for what I said so hush hush.. The only truly legit reason to go with a closed loop cooler is aesthetics.. That or curiosity about watercooling.. What are the other benefits? &gt;I wanted to go with a Corsair CX because they are the most sold unit here in Germany but well.. reddit teaches you I guess ;)

Thank god it does, lol.. You ended up choosing an awesome powersupply, it'll last you at least 3 times as long as the Corsair one would've :P 

Nice build man. Enjoy. 

Edit:

&gt;currently the front and side are intakte; top and back are exhaust... should I keep it that way?

Buy dust filters for every intake fan that doesn't have one, including the PSU. It's important that the PSU stays dust free. You want to keep dust out as well as possible. Your fan orientation is good, maybe switch the top fan to intake in the front, so you have 2 intake in the front, and then turn your side panel fan to exhaust so that it sucks hot air away from the GPU. The front intake fans provide enough cold air to the GPU already, getting the hot air out of the case as fast as possible through the side panel would be good. Hot air goes up, so the top fan isn't needed, the hot air will rise up and exit on its own. Where do you live? That's definitely not the most cost effective option. What is Google? I second /r/hardwareswap. There are EU, UK, AU and CA versions too.This build really doesn't make a lot of sense, sorry, gaming and AMD CPUs just don't mix, if you actually will use a ton of cores but are on a budget then AMD is the way to go, but Intel wins in single core performance, which is what games need. 

I'll put something together and see if you like it, gimme a minute. Before I post the build I came up with, do you really want to keep that case or can you step down to something cheaper and more cost effective? How about the fan controller? Your motherboard will automatically control your fans, so I don't really see the need for it. Same for the extra fan. That's all stuff you can add later, I think you should focus on getting the best possible parts for your money right now and add silly things like extra fans and a fan controller later.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xPhyCJ) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xPhyCJ/by_merchant/)

-The i5 4690K is awesome, and it will last you for at least 7-8 years. Especially if you overclock it a little bit it will stay more than powerful enough for a long, long time. 

-Good enough Z97 motherboard by MSI, you don't wanna go push any insane overclocks on a board like this, but it's good. 

-Switched the RAM to a cheaper kit 

-Switched the SSD to a much cheaper one, it'll still perform great. You won't notice a difference. 

-Upgraded the GPU to the much more powerful R9 390. The color scheme clash here is real, but you don't have a side panel window, so who cares. 

-Switched the case to an NZXT Source 220, this is a great cheap-ish case, it includes 2 fans, one on the top and one in the back. I'd move the one in the top to the front, and put the fan I included in the build on the side panel, sucking hot air away from the GPU and **out** of the case. You can also mount the PSU with the fan up, or get a cheap dust filter locally and mount the PSU with the fan down. As long as you are only running a single R9 390 the PSU won't be under a ton of load, and it won't have any problem with the hot air from your GPU, but if you add a second R9 390 later then you may want to flip the PSU around since it'll be at high loads and run hotter, you don't want it to suck hot air in under that load. 

-PSU, nothing to say here. Excellent choice. Enough power to add another R9 390 later on, and an extremely high quality and reliable unit in general. You're very welcome, glad I could help. You can contact me on Telegram if you need any help or tips before or during building. I have the same name there as I do here. Looks great, I'm incredibly jealous. Though, you could've spent a lot less money and gotten the exact same performance. That cooler is so much overkill for your CPU, the motherboard is insanely expensive, Windows 10 Pro.. Why? Genuinely curious. I read the comment about the 970 being a burner card, and I get that, so I'm not talking about the GPU, but I'm still wondering why you chose to overspend on the cooler, motherboard, and why you got Windows 10 Pro [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/QWV6Hx) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/QWV6Hx/by_merchant/)

-Much more powerful CPU for video editing, 6 cores of pure power. And you should be able to easily overclock it to 4.5Ghz, no problem. 

-CPU cooler, really quiet and well performing cooler, if you think you can spend a little more money, get the Noctua NH-D15. It will perform better and be even quieter, but it's about 35 dollars more expensive.

-Motherboard to fit the socket 2011-3 CPU. 

-Cheaper quad channel RAM, looks don't matter because the case doesn't have a window, but these sticks are matte black anyway. Good enough. 

-Cheaper SSD. 

-Cheaper GPU (still a 970) by EVGA, if a 970 turns out not to be enough for your needs you can use EVGA's step-up program to upgrade to a better card, you'll send your 970 back, and only pay the difference between what you paid for your 970 and the new card. So if the 970 was 300 dollars and the new card is 550 dollars you send your 970 back, pay 250 dollars and they will send you the better card. 

-Switched the case from the R5 to the R4, it's much cheaper but still a very good case. It's also silence optimised. 

-Switched the PSU to a 650W unit, if you want to run SLI later on you're gonna need 900W or more with this CPU, as it's very powerful but also very power hungry. 

-Switched Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Home, what do you even need Pro for? Do you need the features Pro offers or did you just pick it because you could? 


&gt;Is this enough of an upgrade that I will notice a significant speed improvement?

Yes, you'll see a **huge** performance improvement. 

http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i7-950-vs-Intel-Core-i7-5820KI'm reading everywhere that the newer SSDs have a basically infinite amount of read/write requests before they die, really, likely 10+ years if not longer. 

Please do consider my build, if you want a machine to last long you need high quality parts. You can change a few things of course but stick to good brands, the only thing I really urge you to leave is the powersupply. Powersupplies are tricky, and you can't just look at a brand and go "Yeah, it's a good brand so that PSU is good." (unless that brand is Seasonic or Superflower, neither of them make bad units as far as I know.) That's really strange, a 360 and 240mm rad setup should easily be able to handle your components... What's your CPU core voltage like? 


&gt; I've been thinking I just got a shitty draw in the silicon lottery.

This doesn't really happen with the extreme platform chips, they're cherry picked as far as I know. What is loud? The fans or the pump? And how loud is extremely loud? Extremely loud in my head is a plane engine.. [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/b4q3TW) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/b4q3TW/by_merchant/)

-Much cheaper but still more than good enough CPU cooler. 

-Cheaper motherboard without WiFi. Do you need WiFi? 

-2x8GB kit is cheaper than buying sticks separately. I think getting 16GB is a good idea, I find myself running out of RAM with 8GB quite often, everything is starting to take more and more RAM, having a bit extra isn't bad. 

-Switched storage to a 256GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive. 

-GPU, good pick, but if you're playing at 1080p and don't have plans of buying a 1440p display, get an MSI R9 390X, it gets 60+ FPS in any game at 1080p and it's significantly cheaper than the 980. You can also pick a cheaper motherboard if you go for the 390X. 

-Changed the case to a high quality Phanteks case, they make really good stuff. You're going to be looking at this thing for the coming few years, I think it's a waste to not spend a bit extra on it. Your budget allows it. If you want to cut the cost down, get a NZXT Source 220.

-Changed the PSU to a higher quality G2 unit. The EVGA NEX series is old and doesn't perform very well. 

-Switched to Windows 10. Come on man, move along with your time. Windows 7 is getting out dated, and anyone that's sticking to it because they think it's better than Windows 10 is being ignorant. You just have to get used to the new look for a few weeks, that's all.. 

1.150V is stupidly low, that shouldn't be getting close to the temperatures you're getting.. Really the only thing I can think of is that you got some shit stuck in your CPU block, which is part of the reason why I love the see through blocks.. Did you flush your watercooling parts before using them? When they come from the factory there's usually some trash in the radiators and blocks that you need to wash out.. That's really the only thing I can think of.. Wellll.... Have you seen the 150-ish MSI boards? They're sexy as heck too. :P Well what did you expect? It's a tiny, tiny little pump crammed into a CPU block. That tiny thing has to push water through the entire loop and radiator :/

It shouldn't be loud, but it'll definitely be louder than most decent fans. Okay, that's a legit reason. I see some people on large budgets picking Pro for no reason other than "it's probably better".. If your rig is mostly for editing then the 5820K is very worth it, it's an awesome chip at stock speeds, but when you overclock it to 4.4-ish ghz it becomes a monster. That speed is super easily achievable with a good cooler. [The 5820K at stock speed (3.4ghz) is about 25-10% faster than the 6700K at stock speed (4ghz)](http://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_core_i7_5820k-440-vs-intel_core_i7_6700k-518), so that is already pretty awesome, but when you overclock both the gap becomes even bigger. I don't have numbers on this, but you can use your imagination. 

The 6700K already has a high stock speed, right? You can maybe overclock it by 600 mhz (4.6ghz) before getting into uncomfortable voltage levels. The 5820K on the other hand, can reach about the **same** speed before getting into the uncomfortable voltage level. Yeah. That's a **1.2 ghz overclock** on top of the stock speed. That's **double** the overclock you can expect on the 6700K.EVGA has much, much better customer support, and that feature isn't only on the Asus card. I think most cards do it nowadays. Btw I forgot to say that you have 3 months since purchase to apply for a step-up though, but you'd find out if you need it or not within 3 months anyway.


Edit: Nope, I was wrong about the cooler. It doesn't turn the fans off at idle.. I still don't want to recommend the Asus one though, just because of their customer service.. 

Edit edit: Aaand the MSI one doesn't do it either. God damnit. I know the Gigabyte one does it, but their customer support isn't all there either. If you want it to be silent when idle, then I guess those two are your only options. 


Edit edit edit: I'm making myself look stupid, the Gigabyte one doesn't do it either. Just don't listen to me, I'm an idiot. I assumed that because their 980Ti G1 Gaming card does it, the 970 G1 Gaming would too. Guess not. 


Many, many edits later I have come to the conclusion that the Asus card is the quietest while idle decently quiet under load, but the VRMs get extremely hot under load, the Gigabyte card has one of the best power delivery systems and is the coolest and quietest under load and the EVGA one is shockingly bad. They really fucked up on the 970.I've got nothing, sorry dude. Good luck, let me know when you figure it out, I'm pretty curious. And this just confirms that I'm an idiot even further. 

Get the MSI one if you value customer support. *insert trash talking about Rosewill here*

But really, I'm going to guess the PSU fried your shit, harddrives don't just blow themselves up.. Good pick. It'll last you for at least 10 years. Yup you fucked up. Spend more time watching build guides because you clearly have no idea what you're doing. Do you even have thermal paste? Sorry, but both of these builds aren't very good for gaming. Intel destroys AMD in gaming performance. The second build isn't much better than the first either, hold on. As I commented on your other post, AMD CPU doesn't make sense for gaming. I put something together here and I'll explain all the changes I made so I can hopefully teach you some things :P

-Much more powerful Intel quad core, games favor fewer strong cores rather than more weaker cores. This chip is also overclockable. 

-CPU cooler, you can always add something better later on when you want to push for really high overclocks, but this one is much more cost effective and it will cool your CPU good enough for a moderate 4.4 or so ghz overclock. 

-Motherboard, you could go cheaper here but I like MSI's quality and customer support, and it fits your budget. 

-Left the RAM, it's actually not that overpriced right now. 

-Switched the single 3TB drive for a 240GB SSD, this will **really** help your PC feel fast and responsive. 1TB is good enough for now, you can always add more storage later on. 

-Left GPU, good choice. 

-Changed case to something cheaper, Phanteks makes really high quality cases. This is one of them. 

-Changed powersupply to a *much* better unit, Corsair RM series is really nothing more than average in both the performance and quality departement. This EVGA G2 unit has 10 years of warranty, and a near flawless rating from jonnyguru. It's an incredible unit. 

Maybe you could drop the fan controller for now to save some money. The motherboard should handle your fan speeds just fine. I also removed the thermal paste because the Hyper 212 Evo comes with a tube of it.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-05 03:35 EDT-0400 |EVGA G2 series, as I said in my other comment. Some of the best PSUs you can buy. What cooler do you have anyway? You mentioned pins.. Also how did you clean the thermal paste off your CPU and cooler before reapplying it? Should be done with toilet paper and 90% alcohol. How high? Why? Not really, right now the 390 just makes most sense for 1080p/1440p gaming, and with an 850W PSU you can add another 390 later and run Crossfire. Please have a look at the 2 builds I posted in my other comment. That's way, way too hot... What The heck are you doing? Take the cooler off, clean the thermal paste as well as you can, reapply thermal paste and put the cooler on properly.. Your CPU should always stay below 80 degrees, below 75 is preferable. It's not defective, but you're going to kill your CPU if you keep running it that hot. Above 100 degrees you can cause serious damage. Just reapply your thermal paste and seat your cooler properly. Looks great, nice build.


&gt;I can take the CPU multiplier up to 38 before things get unstable.

That means you're doing it wrong, 3.8ghz is stock speed. You can go way higher, 4.4ghz should be really easy to reach. Want me to help you overclock? Holy shit get your ass over to /r/cablemanagementPost a pcpartpicker list please, follow the template. It's really hard for us to help you like this. 430W is enough for that, but the unit OP picked isn't very good. Your pick is much higher quality. 


Edit: Ehhhhhh... I'm not so sure now after Googling, it may be cutting it close. The i5 4460 + motherboard / RAM and a hard drive uses 150W under full load, and the R9 390 takes 275, soo.... Yeahh.. You're right, better go for the 550W XFX unit. Cases don't make sound, fans do970: definitely. 

But you're right about the 390.NZXT makes good fans, but I know /u/Maleton3 has this case, so he can properly answer your question. He may still be asleep like the little bitch he is, though. Looks good. You can get the exact same performance for a lot less money, you're overspending on the CPU cooler, motherboard, RAM, and you should get your GPU from another company. Great PSU pick though. Why 2 500GB SSDs and not 1 1TB SSD? 


Edit: Actually, your build isn't even close to \u20ac2000, you used the US version of pcpartpicker, you should've used de.pcpartpicker.com because prices are extremely different here. Alright here is the build I came up with. Your original build is 2300 euros if you buy it all in Germany so I edited it to fit in the ~\u20ac2000 budget.

Changes;

-Much less expensive CPU cooler, there is no need for such a huge cooler unless you want to go for insane overclocks that you probably shouldn't run 24/7 anyway. Skylake is really efficient and it doesn't kick out as much heat as previous CPUs, the H75 will cool it without any problems. 

-Much less expensive motherboard, the Asus board doesn't fit into this budget unless you cut down on other stuff. MSI makes high quality stuff and their customer support is great, so this board is a good choice. 

-Switched the RAM to a lower speed kit to save money. You **really** don't need super fast RAM, it doesn't make a difference, at all. Unless you're using an AMD APU with integrated graphics. 

-Changed the SSDs to a single 1TB SSD, this is cheaper and easier to manage. SSDs are so fast, there's almost no point in putting them in RAID 0, and doing RAID 1 on SSDs is just dumb, then go for a pair of 2TB hard drives for mass safe storage. 

-Changed the GPU to the Gigabyte G1 Gaming 980Ti, this is one of the best cooler designs ever and you really won't notice any difference between it and the Asus STRIX version, beside the money in your wallet that will still be there. The Asus card is almost \u20ac100 more expensive. 

-Changed the case to the Phanteks Enthoo Pro M, Phanteks makes really high quality cases. It's cheaper than the H440, and in my opinion it looks better. Watch some reviews, I think you'll like it. If not, there's many other options. 

-Changed the PSU to a \u20ac15 cheaper XFX Pro Black Edition unit, it's made by Seasonic and it's an excellent performer. Also very reliable and stable. If you want the EVGA G2 unit anyway I wouldn't blame you, it's only 15 euros.. Here's a review of the XFX unit http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/xfx-pro-850-w-black-edition-full-modular-power-supply-review/13/

I just posted a full build that should answer all your questions :) You're welcome :D Glad I could help. What does your current build look like? And what are you going to do with it? Light it on fire and dance around it to worship your new build? Cool :)  

Glad I could teach you something about powersupplies. They matter, a lot, and not all expensive units are good. Not all gold certified units are good, and not even all platinum certified units are good. You have to look at the OEM when it comes to PSUs, not the company that sells it. Always read a review about the PSU you're going to buy before buying it, especially if that review is by jonnyguru. 

And about the SSD thing, fine, I'm not gonna try to convince you, but at least get a fast WD Black drive :PNah. As far as I know, Skylake chips aren't nearly as random as previous generation chips. Just about all of them can do the same overclock +-200mhz or so. Depends. Do you need WiFi (internally, not via a USB thingy)? Because most Mini-ITX boards have built in WiFi, while most Micro-ATX boards don't. Are you planning to crossfire / SLI in the future? Because Mini ITX boards only have one PCI-E slot. Oh! I forgot about this, but the case only comes with one fan, in the back. There's no front fans included, so you may want to pick up one or two of these;


http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/arctic-cooling-case-fan-afaco12000gba01

They're the same color as the pre-installed 140mm fan in the back so they'll fit with the rest of your build nicely. Lol, sounds like what I did. My build is about 5 years old now, i5 2500K, a 7970 and 8GB of RAM. So what're you gonna do with the old build? Sell it? I bet some people on /r/HardwareSwapUK would be interested in at least some of the parts. I know I'd want the CPU and motherboard for a second hand scrap build I'm doing for fun, but I don't have money so that's a no go xD 

Right now the status of the scrap build is;

-Old HP case with a motherboard and a dead CPU installed that I found by the garbage

-Motherboard that was in the case

-CPU, AMD Athlon II X4 635 / 2.9 Ghz that I found for \u20ac10 on eBay. 

-RAM 8GB mix &amp; match. 4 GB from a friend's old computer and 4GB from a box full of tech shit in my neighbors garage. He didn't know what it was and said I could take it, lol. 

-GPU Nvidia GTX 660, a friend had it laying around and sent it to me for \u20ac20 

-PSU, scared that it's going to explode, so I don't dare to install the GPU. I'm going to wait until I find a better PSU xD

Edit: Oh yeah, total cost so far is only \u20ac30 Then go Mini ITX, they have high speed AC WiFi built in with antennas on the back. The case isn't small enough if it fits a Hyper 212 Evo :PDo you live in the US? Check out Sager laptops. They're decently priced and have a lot of customisation options. Ayy haha, I'm enjoying it. It's taking a long time, but it'll be worth it because I'm going to give it away to my best friend's girlfriend. She's never had a computer in her life, and she always plays games on my friend's rig so I'm going to give this to her. Right now she's using a second hand (160 euros new) chromebook that can barely play youtube videos. If OP is willing to spend a premium on a truly tiny case, the Ncase M1 is beautiful. You know you need to increase the voltage to run higher clock speeds right? Try 1.35V for 4.5ghz that should easily be stable. So are you gonna answer the question or what The lazy and easy way is set your core voltage to 1.350, and your multiplier to 47 and see if it's stable. If it's not stable, change multiplier to 46, if it's still not stable you have a shit chip and you should lower it to 45.. That's the really quick and lazy way not the proper way but you can find that on the Internet. Yes that's a decent video, but the thermal limits and voltage limits he says are too high. I wouldn't let my CPU go over 75-80 degrees under load and I wouldn't put over 1.35V into it either. I know Intel says 1.42 is the "safe" maximum voltage for 24/7 usage, but that's bullcrap. Your CPU won't last longer than a few years or even less at that voltage. Never leave voltage on auto, most boards will put it WAY too high. What you're experiencing is pretty common, to stop your VCore from moving around so much you can enable Load Line Calibration (LLC) and set it to normal/high/extreme. Whatever works best for you. Also try CPU-Z and AIDA64's monitoring feature (in the statistics tab) to check if they all report the same. I don't have any experience with hwinfo so I don't know how accurate it is, I've always used CPU-Z and AIDA64. &gt;Next time I'll use something to protect my hands like rubber gloves...

Just learn to handle your expensive hardware more carefully, you shouldn't need to protect yourself if you're careful. Though, rubber cloves would prevent any static discharge so it's good to wear them anyway I guess.  

And yeah, you need cable management. Jesus christ. LolI'm also curious, since this is a really powerful CPU and it kicks out a shit ton of heat even on only a moderate overclock. ...why?loserwhat.... I'd return that chip in the blink of an eye.. No, it's really not. They're significantly more expensive, and they get really, and I mean *really* hot because of their insane speed which makes them throttle their speed down unless you have good airflow going over them. But, if you do a ton of small reads/writes or if you move huuuge files from one place to another on that same disk then it could be worth it. I think you should wait for the technology to mature and prices to come down. 

RAM: No, it doesn't matter. Speed doesn't matter either, and CAS latency doesn't either. Not for filthy casuals like us that don't miss out on thousands of dollars every split second their machine stands still. Aesthetics is what it's about with RAM for us. I would've returned it within the return period straight away... :(/r/hardwareswap 

Just make a post asking for the absolute cheapest components people have, and then keep asking until you have all the (compatible) parts. How the what the fuck 

Why did nvidia give a Titan X to a 10 year old?  (genuine question, I'm curious.)You don't need the extra PCI lanes the 5930K offers since you're only using a single GPU and no other PCI devices. HUUUUUGELY overpriced motherboard, apparently unreliable hard drive. I'd spend the  money you saved on your motherboard and CPU on a 4TB WD Black drive for fast and reliable mass storage. And here's my build.. 

-Cheaper 5820K, /u/sk9592 and me explained why it's a better pick here. 

-Better and quieter cooler to cool a nice overclock. 

-Much cheaper but still really high quality motherboard. 

-Cheaper same spec RAM. 

-Changed the HDD to a WD Black 4TB drive. 5 years of warranty and high speed is worth the premium price tag. 

Other than that your choices are excellent, MSI makes great GPUs, EVGA sells great PSUs, Crucial sells good value SSDs, and the R5 is a great case. But I do have a suggestion for another case, take a look at what Phanteks offers around (and below) that price range, they've been killing it in the case market lately with some really high quality and competitively priced cases. 

Edit: I should actually post the build, shouldn't I?

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-05 16:30 EDT-0400 |Your explanation about why you chose your parts makes sense, so I won't comment on the motherboard, but the CPU cooler is hugely overkill. You should go with something less expensive like a Corsair H75 or H105, unless you upgrade to the 5820K, then you should go for at least the H105, which brings me to your CPU choice. You can get a 5820K for about the same price as a 6700K, so that may be worth considering. It's a much more powerful CPU, especially when you overclock it. 


And Mindfactory sells your PSU for about 10 euros cheaper, idk about shipping though. http://m.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/750-Watt-Corsair-RMi-Series-Modular-80--Gold_1005946.html

The Asus 970 gets destroyed by the Gigabyte G1 Gaming 970 cooling wise, so definitely consider that. The G1 Gaming card stays under 60 degrees everywhere, while the Asus one doesn't properly cool the VRMs which get up to like 87 or something degrees.

Do you actually need a feature of Windows 10 Pro or are you just buying the Pro version because you can? 

And check out the cases Phanteks offers around that price point, they make beautiful and really high quality stuff. 34 degrees hot? Are you mad? 34 degrees is nothing man.. A H100i is way overkill for the 6600K unless you want to pump 1.4+V into it which is a terrible idea. Save some money and get a H75 instead. More than good enough. If it manages to survive your overclocking madness would you send it to me for my &lt;$50 scrap build? I'll pay shipping :DThere is a really in depth Haswell overclocking guide featuring the 4770k/Z87 (pretty much the same idea though) by a forum member on the anandtech forums, it shouldn't be hard to find. 


Edit: http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2326390*sigh*

Watercooling is nothing more than an aesthetics thing, it doesn't actually perform better at the same price range. The 75 dollar NH-D14 performs on par with the 100 dollar Corsair H100, and it's only a few degrees behind the 110 and up. And air coolers cool the area around the CPU as well, unlike watercoolers. Stop fanboying over watercooling. *sigh*

Watercooling is nothing more than an aesthetics thing, it doesn't actually perform better at the same price range.

Stop fanboying over watercooling. Use AIDA64 and its temperature/voltage monitoring ability in the statistics tab. Or CoreTemp, but AIDA is nice because it has everything you need to know in one place. I agree with you, but to be honest, 90% of the people that use watercooling (including myself) do it for the aesthetics. I mean, be real, any air cooler doesn't look nearly as good as most decently designed water coolers, let alone a custom loop. Air cooling is much more cost effective, that's True. Even at a slight overclock the 5820K beats the 6700K overclocked to the max, I don't have numbers on that but I'm pretty sure that I'm right.. 

Edit: Yup, 5820K at 3.9ghz matches a 6700K at 4.8ghz, both score 1000-ish in cinebench. Now imagine that 5820K at 4.6ghz, which it can easily do with a good cooler like the Noctua NH-D14 ($75)I know that, obviously. I'm not talking about FPS, if we were talking about FPS you shouldn't even be touching i7s, stick to an easy to cool i5 with a cheap cooler like the Hyper 212 evo and get a hugely better GPU. You're missing my point I think :pNvidia fucked themselves so hard there.. Okay, cool, but if silence is the goal you shouldn't even be considering an all in one watercooler :P Good points. :) Considering the 980Ti is like 300 euros cheaper where I live... Ehhhhhh  :PLol, poor little chip. Good luck with the 5ghz journey. How do you know? If your motherboard got swapped your cooler got reapplied too right? LolAnd then there's my Corsair M60, has one of those actually died yet since they were released? I doubt it, because I'm not be ry careful with my mouse, I'm careful with all my stuff but the mouse gets the gamer rage smash on the table quite often, and I have a laptop so it always travels with me, falls, hits things, etc.. Great mouse :PVery sexy. To be completely honest, you probably shouldn't be building a custom loop if you can't figure the sizes out by Googling a bit. umm... That's a very low budget you got there. Yeah it's possible, but not if you have to buy Windows. Do you have a copy already? Your computer is going to break real soon if you keep using that PSU, just saying.. 

And yeah your thermal paste has bubbles in it because of what you did so it won't cool as well anymore. If temperatures are okay under load you can leave it, but I'd replace it. No need to upgrade the  CPU, just overclock it a bit and you're good. Add new GPUs and call it a day. 


I recommend upgrading your PSU too, I can't imagine that thing being too good. Try /r/watercooling I don't think there's too many people here all that knowledgeable about custom loops. I can't find anything about that PSU other than the product page, so it could be great but it could also be terrible.. I wouldn't trust it since it's already pretty old. Are PSUs expensive in Denmark? Don't get a Corsair PSU, only their AX/AXi/HX/HXi/RMi series are good (not RM, the i matters.) and there are much cheaper great options. ...Because deepcool makes ticking time bombs instead of real PSUs 


I'm not even joking is the best (worst?) part. 


Edit; oh and your PSU isn't even capable of delivering 500W, it can only do 408W.. Lol.. That should give you a good idea about how shit it is. Quality of the components inside make a huge difference in performance, stability, reliability, safety and longevity. 

You can take a look at the [PSU tier list](http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html), that list isn't 100% accurate but it should give you a pretty good idea. Seasonic and Superflower make most of the tier 1 and 2 PSUs. Nah, new motherboards aren't compatible with your CPU. Upgrade your board along with your CPU whenever you do, but right now it's kind of a waste of money Refer to this list when buying your next PSU, it isn't 100% accurate, but it should give you a good idea. As you can see, Seasonic and Superflower make most of the tier 1 and 2 PSUs, they're among the best PSU manufacturers. 

http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.htmlThe never ending maintenance and increased risk you take if you do not properly maintain your loop is the most overlooked part of custom watercooling by newcomers, not that I am experienced by any means. I've never done a custom loop before, and I'm not planning to any time soon, because I just don't have the time and especially money to maintain it right now, or in the near future. I'm busy with school, and spending money on something I don't have to spend money on is the last thing I need. I plan on doing it for my next rig after I graduate, when I completely re-do my build that's currently 5 years old but still kicking ass. I saw your comment on another thread saying your post didn't get a lot of attention and you still had questions do you still need help? Are these parts bought yet? I also recommend going Mini ITX In the smallest case possible if you don't plan on expanding.

Lemme put something together for you Best performance build here, overclockable CPU, Z97 board, 16GB of RAM, same GPU, good PSU. It checks all boxes I think.

http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.htmlReally? That's not too bad... As i said I've never actually built a custom loop, I've only read about it (a lot) and everybody always says that it's super time consuming and expensive to maintain custom loops, like, over 100 euros per year.. And suddenly I'm interested in doing a custom loop again... RIP my money. My only comments are to get a cheaper motherboard, Windows 10 Home licence instead, and not an OEM licence. Consider a cheaper wifi card, maybe the Enthoo Pro M instead, to save some space on his desk, full towers are huge.. Maybe switch the 970 to a 390, but if he does that he should consider a bigger PSU as well to be able to go crossfire in the future. You know PSUs run most efficiently between 50-60% load, right? 750W is near perfect for this system. It will consume around 450-500W under load which is like 60% of what a 750W unit can do. (I didn't do math, but it's something around there) Crucial also has excellent customer support in my experience. I bought 2 M4 128GB SSDs like 5 years ago, and a lot of those M4's failed after a certain amount of read/writes, they replaced both of them with newer, faster, and higher capacity models for me after a single call and 3 emails with their support. Happy customer here, would buy again and recommend Crucial any time.Just don't use anything other than extremely high percentage alcohol. (90+)

If you can't find that, use dry toilet paper, a lot of it, until the cpu and heatsink stop staining the paper. Asus' 970 doesn't actively cool the VRMs, which isn't a huge deal, but it's something to consider. The Gigabyte G1 Gaming model has the best cooler, and nothing on that whole card gets hot. 

Corsair CX line is shit, you could get a cheaper motherboard too. The VRMs only get up to like 90 degrees on the Asus STRIX so it isn't that bad, hold on, let me have a look if I can cut some costs somewhere. Here's a temperature comparison between the two cards, both of them are well within safe limits, so it's all up to you. http://m.imgur.com/a/gnOyY source = guru3d's reviews 

Onto the build;

Cheaper board, cheaper RAM, cheaper SSD, cheaper case and a slightly more expensive but much higher quality and more reliable powersupply.

-Cheaper motherboard that includes WiFi 

-Cheaper RAM, single stick to leave upgradeability to 16GB open. 

-Cheaper PSU of equal (read; not very high) quality. If you can spend a bit more on your PSU it would last much longer and be more reliable. 

Edit: Added better PSU. Whoops, I overlooked this unit. 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii520bronze


This one is very goodFairly sure you can turn the BIOS splash screen off somewhere.. Alright good :DIf your stuff is all 6 years old I think you're best off heading over to /r/hardwareswap to either sell it whole, or part it out. The PSU is probably just about at the end of its life, what exact model is it? It's probably not worth reusing the CPU cooler, the tiny pumps in those all in one coolers don't last all that long but you can use it until it dies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Good SSDs are at least 3 times faster than even the WD Black drives, which are some of the fastest hard drives on the market, but SSDs are also a lot more expensive. Are you willing to give up storage capacity for speed? If yes, then get the SSD. 

And what do you mean with waiting for USB 3.1? It's already out, and plenty of higher end motherboards have USB 3.1 ports. USB 3.0 has pretty much become the standard, there's at least 6 USB 3.0 ports on most boards, and like 2 USB 2.0 ports. Terrible advice. There's so many more awesome units available by companies like Superflower and Seasonic. Could you maybe add me on Skype or Telegram and send me all the links to the parts you're getting? I can look on those websites to see if there's any better options. I'd use pricerunner but their sorting system is terrible, it doesn't have a lot of options. Then by all means, keep using it :p

The weird SSD things on motherboards are M.2 drives and there way too expensive to make sense right now. Beautiful build man, looks good. Good component choices as well. 

&gt;Not wanting to go out and get isopropyl alcohol and redo the whole cooler install

Quick newbie tip, you don't actually need anything but toilet paper to clean thermal paste off the CPU and heatsink. The alcohol is just recommended because it dissolves the thermal paste, easing the removal process, but it will come off just fine without alcohol too with a lot of rubbing. It takes a little bit longer, and it takes more paper, but if you keep using clean paper until it doesn't get stained anymore it's exactly the same as if you used alcohol. For next time :P1.5V? Are you mad? Holy god... What kind of cooler do you have to even handle that? And how long have you been running it like that? 

Well RIP soon, it did a fine job.

I'm new here and here and the sidebar doesn't seem to contain any info on how to get a flair.. Could you enlighten me? What the fuck. Is that support rep high? 

Good luck, lol.. Hm. I would probably just run it at 4.8ghz in that case, but then again, I wouldn't take my 2500K near 1.5V in the first place so our priorities are clearly different :P 

Aren't the extreme chips supposed to be higher quality silicon, and better overclockers than the regular non extreme chips? Because my 2500K doesn't need anywhere near 1.5V to run 5ghz, I think last time I tried pushing it I got it to 5.1Ghz @ 1.46V... But I also only have 1600mhz RAM, that could be why.. I don't know all that much about overclocking to be honest :P

And yea, I saw that edit button but it doesn't do anything for me. I'm gonna guess that it just doesn't work on mobile and I should use my computer to edit it. Thank you. 

Edit: There we go. Flair is up :)
Yes. Doesn't change anything about what I said, because Superflower also makes their own PSUs, and PSUs for a few other companies. As does Seasonic. As far as I'm concerned it's always better to get one powerful GPU rather than 2 less powerful ones. A 980**Ti** easily fits into a $2000 budget, so you're massively over-spending on something if you can't get that GPU. Could you post your build so I can take a look?Nah, stick with the 6700**K**, but hold off on the overkill cooler. Get the Hyper 212 Evo (maybe second hand?) and save some money. You still haven't replied to my other comment, by the way.

The 980 Ti is the "4K this, 4K that, 4K max settings" monster, a regular ol' 980 will do great at 1440p as well.Looks good, only overspending on the RAM, RAM speed doesn't matter. CAS latency does, a little bit, the lower the better, but speed really doesn't. The files you're editing are on your storage drives, the speed at which those drives can move it into and out of RAM will always be slower than what the RAM can handle.

And the FTW edition 980Ti seems to cost the same as the Superclocked + one, so.. here;

Read that, and then ask yourself if you need any of the features, because Home is significantly cheaper than Pro....That doesnt make any sense, what features are you talking about? X99 has more features than Z170, it's the extreme platform for a reason. Haswell-E is currently the best choice for future proofing because the lowest end X99 CPU beats the highest end Z170 CPU, by the time you'll want to upgrade a 5820K, Skylake and socket 1151 will be outdated already. Getting a cheaper cooler isn't skimping, it's saving money, Skylake just doesn't put out that much heat, it's not hard to cool a 6700K at anything under 1.4V, you really don't need a $150 cooler. Oh and since the case is still undecided, have a look at Phanteks cases. The Gigabyte cooler is seriously insanely quiet, I dont know what's up with their tests but from first hand experience I can tell you that their cooler design is fucking incredible. One of my friend has a 970 Windforce (not G1 gaming, but that shouldn't matter) and it is pretty much inaudible with the side panel closed under full GTA V load. Another friend has the 980 Ti G1 Gaming and that is also pretty much inaudible while running Valley (100% load), soo... MSI and EVGA have the best customer service, while Gigabyte and Asus are both lacking quite a bit when it comes to that, so if you value after sales support then definitely consider EVGA and MSI. Also look into EVGA's step-up program, for if it turns out that the 970 isn't fast enough.

The specific models of EVGA's cards you want to be looking at are the FTW edition and the Classified edition.Umm...The 5820K has significantly more PCI-E lanes than the 6700K, and a lot of X99 boards have 3.1 ports too, soo.... You may want to reconsider :P No, if there are no visit particles you're all good. Decent quality toilet paper or kitchen roll is good, if there's no visible particles left after wiping you're good to go. Auto overclock... noo... :(

Auto overclocking tools always set the voltage much higher than it needs to be from my experience, I bet you can drop it down quite a bitIt will always heat your room up more than an nvidia counterpart no matter how good the cooler is. I really doubt you'll notice much of a difference, really, the 390 uses 60-80 watts more than the 970 right? That really isn't that much more especially in terms of heat. If you wanna chat about your future build and have some questions and doubts answered you can message me on Telegram, I have the same name there as I do here. It's available for all platforms. I think the 290 used significantly more power than the 390 does, but I may be wrong. The fuck is your problem? You come here to ask for advice, /u/Arthmost gives you advice, and you say shit like this? Piss off man. Don't remind me of such weather... I'm still in denial.. Yes. You could use your PSU as an exhaust fan as well, to draw hot air away from the GPU. 

Asus and Gigabyte also have terrible customer support afaik and people still buy from them, soo... I'm just saying you could flip it around and have it intake from the case and exhaust from the read from some extra cooling in case you don't have enough airflow in your case. Why do you want such a huge tower? Do you have 4 GPUs to actually fill it up? Lol. 

 Don't use prime95 it throws an unrealistic load at your CPU and can easily damage it. Use AIDA 64 it has built in voltage and temperature monitoring, send a screenshot of the statistics tab after having stress tested for about a minute or two with AIDA 64 Since you haven't overclocked it your voltage is too high. You should be able to do stock speed at 1.310V, and you're at almost 1.380V. 

Start by resetting your BIOS settings to default, that should fix it. If it doesn't, manually set your voltage to offset mode on - 0.060V, which should put you around 1.310/20V.Good to hear. I want to like Gigabyte, but I heard some bad stories. You don't want to do this if you're using a shitty powersupply, but your unit is very very good and it's nowhere near full load with a single 390, so it won't get too hot. Well most mid tower cases can also house a lot of shit. Take a look at Phanteks' cases, they are very high quality and good looking in my opinion. 

Edit: http://phanteks.com/Enthoo-EVOLV-ATX.html

And  http://phanteks.com/Enthoo-Pro.html

Are very good cases. 


How much are you willing to spend anyway? 


Edit edit: CoolerMaster's Master Case Pro 5 is modular and expandable so that could be a good option. Get an Asus Sabertooth board and paint the thermal armor cover thingyI'd just replace all the cables, don't be lazy. I'm not sure if the cables are compatible -No need for thermal paste, it's included. 

-Get a cheaper motherboard, unless you actually need features on that board. 

-Get another PSU, the NEX series isn't very good at all. A 770 should still be plenty powerful for all games at 1080p so idk why you're upgrading.. A 390X would be a good upgrade though. The EVOLV ATX is beautiful, I love the full aluminium and tool less design. Run Memtest86, if it fails, your RAM is faulty. You're welcome, definitely check out hardwarecanucks on YouTube, some of the best case reviews ever. And he has over 100 of them. They're all in a playlist. Run AIDA64 again and look at the Core Voltage in the statistics tab. You see it in your previous screenshot? 1.380V. That's close to the "Safe limit" Intel specifies for 24/7 usage. Want to chat on Telegram instead? That's way faster and easier. My name on there is the same, and it's available on all platforms. Android/iOS/Windows/OSX

Edit: it's the CPU Core number in AIDAI think it can take a long time, so sit back and watch a movie or something. It checks each and every tiny little **bit** of RAM for errors or straight up dead blocks. A good quality 500W PSU will do and he'll be able to upgrade to a more powerful GPU later if he wants to. What's his budget? Lol that's a huge budget, he can get a way higher wattage unit for that much which will last for 10+ years and handle any upgrade he ever wants, or he can save money and get a 500W unit. From lowest to highest price, the lowest price will do just fine for his current PC, and the 850W unit will be good for any Intel quad core + 2 GPUs.

-Cheaper motherboard 

-Added CPU cooler 

-Cheaper RAM 

-Cheaper SSD

-Cheaper and much better PSU
The build I have on pcpartpicker here is better than that build you linked. The Seasonic Gold PSU is also better than the bequiet one. You have mental problems, go see a doctor. http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=323

It passed gold on jonnyguru's tests, and it has amazing performance and build quality for the price. My friend has a Seasonic G 650 and it is extremely quiet, so I don't think the 550W unit will be any different. I'd much rather have a Seasonic unit than an FSP unit. Get a way cheaper motherboard, SSD, case and PSU and upgrade the GPU to a 980Ti, that's the only single GPU that will give you acceptable framerates at 4K with max settings. That's really nice to hear. I'm back to liking Gigabyte. Cool.Don't use that PSU. And I can't find any reviews or any info at all about the damn thing, that's a big nope in my book. Fuck that. Dude, a 390X can barely max GTA V out at 1440p and maintain 60FPS how do you expect it to handle 4K? 

What do you NEED a 180 dollar case for? What do you need an M.2 SSD for? The motherboard CAN use M.2 drives but it doesn't have to Why the shitty PSU? :(

Why didn't you post a build ready before purchasing? 

Edit: Looks beautiful though. Nice pictures. It's an old design and it's kind of unstable, it's made by FSP which doesn't have an awesome track record either. Well, it's an okay PSU, but considering the highest tier 1500W version has issues, I think the lower wattage and much cheaper version is much worse. The NEX series is old, and it isn't very stable. If you plan on overclocking at all then this unit isn't ideal, it has some serious voltage ripple suppression issues. If you're willing to get another one, get the GS or G2 series instead. G2 preferably. Those units tick all the boxes, excellent performance, good value, awesome stability, good reliability, etc. The deal on that XFX unit is crazy good. Wow. I heard rebates are shit though.. (I'm not American) Fair points, though if you're dropping that much on a case I recommend you take a look at the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX, it's a full, thick aluminium build, completely tool-less design, overall extremely high quality. 

https://youtu.be/fQfRDSGlNqIVery, very sexy. I love the build quality and the tool less design most, I think I'll buy it soon. I already have a build, so this would just be an upgrade, my current case is garbage :PI think you're underestimating how how big mid towers are :P 

Unless you want to do a full custom loop with 600 radiators and 90 GPUs a full tower isn't gonna be nearly full. I'm fairly sure the Evolv ATX could hold 3 GPUs no problem. Going for more than 3 GPUs is just dumb anyway, soo.... YeahMeh, it's not that big of a deal in my opinion. With a bit of effort you can hide all the cables well enough. Antec has some incredibly sexy cases, but, they're also incredibly expensive. Same goes for Lian Li. Silverstone has nothing interesting as far as I know, neither does CoolerMaster, other than the Master Case 5. Corsair has some decent cases, but they aren't my thing. 

Caselabs? Heard of them? Caselabs is expensive, but pretty much the highest quality around. Full aluminium and tempered glass side panels. 

Edit: In my opinion, Phanteks is making the most awesome cases that are actually affordable. That's why you shouldn't buy shitty cases :PLaat time I OCed a 5820K I quick and dirty just set the multiplier to 44, voltage to 1.26V and it was stable.. Told my friend to fine tune it himself, but he said he hasn't and it's been stable, so try that.1.375V for 4.5ghz? Damn... RIP your luck in the silicon lottery.. I have nothing bad to say, that's pretty much what I would build -  the case :) Newer SSDs pretty much live infinitely so I wouldn't really worry Stop defending the piece of shit Corsair CX thingy.. It's a bad unit, period. You can get much better units for around the same price. You're spending waaaaayyyyyyy too much money on your motherboard, and SSD, and not enough on your PSU and Case. 

What I mean by that is that there are great quality motherboards for around 100 bucks, and the difference between the Samsung Pro drive and a significantly cheaper Crucial drive won't be noticeable in normal usage, unless you're planning to do some serious video editing off of your SSD, it might speed render times up by a few minutes, but I really don't think it's worth it. The PSU and the case are the longest lasting components of any build if you pick high quality ones, which you haven't done with the PSU, and I don't know much about the case but I know Antec isn't famous for their budget-mid end cases. Yeah, and he also said [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/3jlm2l/do_you_trust_hardware_review_sites_do_you_think/cuqqal6), now look how old the reviews you posted are. 

Now take a look at [this](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=438) review from a few months ago. You know what that unit costs? [Only 8 dollars more.](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0550v1). There is absolutely no reason to get a 2 year old PSU with 3 years of warranty, 80+ Bronze rating, and lower quality components over a similarly priced, few month old PSU with 5 years of warranty, 80+ Gold rating, and high quality components. Your argument is invalid, the Corsair CX series is shit for what they cost and they have no place in any high end system. Fair enough. No, old design and bad stability That's what I thought.. Weird shit :P 

Good on you for fighting it out, now enjoy wondering where the fuck that shit came from Meh, a 970 doesn't quite cut it for 1440p, and the 980Ti is overkill for 1440p.. The 980 fits in between. Sounds like a nightmare.. Good luck with that 4GB and chill said nvidia... :D 

Any 2.5" drive should work unless Dell used some stupid proprietary connector... &gt;my POS CX 750 Psu

Why doesn't that surprise me? 


That image looks horrible, it's most certainly dead. Time to contact Corsair and see what they'll do about it... Good luck :(Who told you it would be okay? I hope it wasn't anyone on this sub... They might, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it..  I hope they do [PCPartPicker part list](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/sNn8NG) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/sNn8NG/by_merchant/)

-Much cheaper motherboard 

-Cheaper RAM

-Much better PSU, you *really* [don't](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3nxv42/do_you_think_my_gtx_960_is_fried/) want a cheap PSU like the CX series. Do you even know what your voltage and temperatures are? Or did you do it all auto? Anything close to 1.4V really isn't good unless you want to buy a new CPU in ~3-4 years You're fine It's super simple, download AIDA64, open it, press the little graph icon in the top bar, a new window will open with a bunch of info and tabs. Go to the Statistics tab, and press start bottom left. Let it run for 1 or 2 minutes or so and then take a screenshot. Post it here, and I'll see if you're good or if something is off. Sound good? Does it matter? The powersupply isn't strong enough to support SLI anyway, so there's no point in getting a motherboard that does. 


OP wanted to lower expenses, not get better performance, right? He also chose a Z97 board, so it's safe to assume his knowledge about motherboards is limited. (no offence, OP, it's good that you're here to learn) Your case is quite extreme and not all that common, but that doesn't make the CX line any less shitty. I really hope Corsair will live up to their "legendary customer support" claim, and replace your shit. Club 3D 7970, coil whine under load regardless of the FPS. it gets worse at high framerates, but it's always pretty bad. I can't hear it with headphones on, though, so it's not that big of a deal. Does it disappear when you overclock the core and memory by like 20/50mhz? I've heard that that works for some people. Lol, yeah, don't get the CX series, those units have no place in any expensive system. -Much better CPU for gaming 

-Motherboard with WiFi built in. Do you want the ability to Crossfire later on? Because then you need an 850W PSU and a bigger motherboard than what I have in this build. 

-8GB of RAM that your build was straight up missing for some reason

-Cheaper SSD

-Much better GPU 

-Much better PSU

Overclocking stops it on some cards. 

Edit: oh loading screens, nvm. All cards coil whine at insanely high FPS like what you get in loading screens. Nvidia control panel bruh (I think. I don't have an nvidia card) Really all of the boards in the link you send are good enough, even the cheapest one. Get a better version of the 970, maybe the [Gigabyte version](http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-video-card-gvn970wf3oc4gd), it has a much better cooler and it'll be a lot quieter and overclock much better, which means it'll perform better. 

You can't get a 390 on a 400W PSU. The PSU is fine if you get the GTX 970 but if you get the R9 390 you need a bigger PSU. 

The R9 390 uses a lot more power than the GTX 970.It depends on your other components but 750W should be plenty if it's a good quality unit. 

What exact PSU do you have? Give us a model number or a picture. You're wasting so much money by not re-using parts from your old computer :/

You should really consider just upgrading the GPU in your old one.. 


Edit: And you bought one of the worst PSUs available, nice. Can you return it? Yes? Return it. There's also much better options for that price, and the fact that there was a post a few hours ago of a CX 750 blowing up and killing a whole PC doesn't help. It's a shitty PSU. Big downgrade in RAM and CPU for OP :/ He should really just re-use those parts and sell the rest of his parts on /r/hardwareswapuk

Edit: that sub is really active, his stuff would sell quickly. What PSU do you have exactly to begin with? 750Ti / 950 / 280X are probably your best bets, and the Hyper 212 Evo is more than enough. 

PSU: anything Seasonic or xfx (Seasonic makes xfx PSUs). There's a great deal going on with xfx PSUs right now, like a 30 dollar mail in rebate. Step down to the 4460, the tiny clock speed difference isn't worth the added cost of the 4690. Ditch the CPU cooler, the stock one is good enough for a locked chip, try to find the ASRock Anniversary board, it's much cheaper. Get a single 8GB stick of RAM to leave the upgrade window to 16GB open. 


With the money you saved you can either upgrade the GPU, or add an SSD for **dat speed**. 970 or **3**90 are both good choices. I recommend you get the Seasonic Gold PSU listed in the build above. It's an excellent unit. That's a pretty good unit idk why the hell it doesn't have two 8 pins.. I think he's better off just not spending money on parts worse than the parts he already has, and parting the left over stuff out on /r/hardwareswapuk, I guarantee you that he can sell all his stuff there separately within a week. Anything under 80 degrees is perfectly fine. If you're gonna overclock later you're gonna need a better cooler. Yes.

That will actually run all games in 4K so it will do great in 1440p for a long time coming. Upgrade the GPU and the powersupply, the PSU isn't good and it's really old so I wouldn't risk it going pop and killing your brand new GPU. A good PSU costs only about 40-70 dollars so then he could still get a 350 dollar GPU which will max out most games at 1080p[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WwqBVn) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WwqBVn/by_merchant/)

Boom. CPUs haven't really evolved much in the raw performance aspect, the real benefits of upgrading would be features and lower power consumption. 

The i7 940 was launched in the end of **2008**, that is *seven* years ago, and CPU performance has only [doubled since then](http://i.imgur.com/JsHLUzv.jpg), which is an incredibly slow development compared to GPUs, their performance went up and keeps going really, really fast.

But, just because there was a 50% improvement in CPU power since then, doesn't mean you'll get 50% more FPS. The 940 is only a tiny bit behind the FX 8350 which is one of AMD's high end chips, and plenty of people have those in gaming rigs nowadays, sooo... Yeahh... It's still perfectly fine, and it can be overclocked, so you could even get some more performance out of it. I put that together really quickly, I'm sure there's some better options. It depends on your needs, but it's a solid build all around. The only thing I'd consider is maybe getting a slightly more expensive motherboard and a cheaper powersupply, but this is good as well. Do you have an i7 2600K, or an i5 2500K? Or a non K chip? Your post doesn't really make that clear. You're welcome, one of my friends and I are also still running CPUs from 2011, that's a little bit more recent but still. Mine is overclocked by a lot, his isn't, mine is an i5, his is an i7.. It doesn't really make much of a difference in gaming at all, I recently built a computer for someone with a GTX 980/i5 4690K in it and I got to spend a few days with it, when I put his GPU in my computer with the 4 year old 2500K performance in GTA V improved, by like... 4 FPS.. :l

In conclusion; unless something drastically changes in the way CPUs work, you should buy a top of the line CPU and then use it for at least 6 years before even starting to think about replacing it because CPU performance develops so slowly.. Ayy, that's cool. Enjoy. Lol alright, well, what was said before still stands. Your CPU is fast enough to not bottleneck any current GPU. Yes, for that price it's one of the highest quality and most well thought out designs available. Phanteks makes some amazing cases, check out Hardwarecanucks' videos featuring the Enthoo Pro M and I think you'll quickly see why I like it so much. For 350 it's pretty expensive, you can get that GPU for like 80 pounds second hand and you can get a better cpu/motherboard deal for like 150 second hand.. I don't think it's worth it.. I also still have a 7970, I bought it at launch and on one hand it's been painful to see my monster card getting pushed further and further down the line, but on the other hand I think it's still a great card since it lasted me this long, I haven't felt the need to upgrade since I bought it so that counts as an awesome purchase in my book. Your CPU will barely even bottleneck SLI 980Ti's, overclock it a bit and you'll be fine for at least 4 more years. If you want some help with it feel free to PM me or contact me on Telegram, my name is the same on there. You absolute should touch your voltage, auto voltage is almost guaranteed to put voltage way higher than it needs to be. Doing it properly is much better, lower temps, longer lifespan, etc :) You can't really get anything great for 200 bucks but if that's all you have then I think you should consider getting a second hand CPU + motherboard (maybe RAM?) deal on /r/hardwareswap. Just make sure you send the money through PayPal, and not as a gift. If you send it as payment / services (I think it's called) you'll be covered by PayPal buyers protection. 

Edit: If you don't want to buy second hand you can get this. The motherboard is "overkill", because you don't need the Z97 chipset since you can't overclock an i3, but since the cheapest i5 puts you over budget, and even with this motherboard you're still under budget I thought why not. You can upgrade to a 4690K later if you can/want and this motherboard will be able to overclock it and all that.

Don't confuse the G1 units with the GS units. 

G1 = NEX Series made by FPS (Old and unstable design compared to the GS&amp;G2 units) 


GS = made by Seasonic (Really good) 


G2 = made by Superflower (Best) Used or new? 

New: 750Ti 

Used: 7970 / R9 280X / R9 290 / GTX 950 / GTX 960 etc. Just head on over to /r/hardwareswap and make a post "[H] $150 [W] GPU" A 500W Corsair CX unit powering an R9 390? Living on the edge I see.. Only upgrade your GPU, your CPU is still good. Overclock it a bit for some extra performance. Do you have a decent cooler? maybe pick up a cheap Hyper 212 Evo and overclock your CPU to 4.5-ish ghz, that should be really easy and completely safe. I can help you do it if you don't know how, I have a 2500K at 4.8ghz, also on an Asus board, so I know exactly how.You're welcome. Just stay under 1.4V and you'll be fine :PGet the 6600K and overclock it in 5 years when you start needing the extra performance. Where in the Netherlands do you live? And if airflow is important to you you should get another case, I don't think the S340 has front intake. Consider the Fractal Design Define S or the Phanteks Enthoo Pro M, they're great build quality and have good airflow.

-Stepped back to Haswell to save some money. The price of Skylake chips, Z170 motherboards and DDR4 RAM are a lot higher than what I have in this build, and you will notice pretty much no difference in performance at all. 

-Switched the GPU to an MSI R9 390, the 390 is a bit faster than the  970 and it has a ton more VRAM, making it slightly more "futureproof". 

-Switched the case to a Fractal Design Define S, much better airflow. 

-Switched the powersupply to a 1000W unit in the name of "futureproofing", the CM V series are excellent quality units made by Seasonic, and you won't have to replace this one for at least like 10 years. The 650W unit you had selected isn't enough to power a second 390 for if you ever want to add another one. Before anyone tells me that there are better options, no, powersupply choices are extremely limited in the Netherlands. They're the exact same card really, just get the one that's cheaper. You can find 7970s for like 120 bucks second hand nowadays so those are great deals. Do you already have these parts? Nah they're literally the same, there is no point in trading :PThen you also need a case right? It should be the other way around :P

Do you want a tiny case, a small case, a normal size case or a huge case? Do you want a side panel window? And how much do you want to spend on it? What's the budget for this build anyway Yeah I figured it was a video rendering rig when I saw the Xeon, it's just a cheaper and locked i7. Makes sense. Since you don't need a window, I'm going to recommenda silence optimised case.

And finally, here's what I came up with.

Now let me explain some of these choices. 

-Z97 board? Why? It's a Xeon, you can't overclock it! I know. But, maybe in 3 years you find yourself a sweet deal on a second hand i7 4790K for really cheap from someone that is upgrading his rig to whatever the fuck the new CPUs then will be called, and you're gonna be thinking "Well shit, I have an overclockable CPU now but I can't overclock it.", so I don't see the harm in going with a Z97 board anyway. It's not a lot more expensive, we're talking like 10 dollars or so of difference between the cheapest H97 board and the cheapest Z97 board (ATX size) 

-The case, Fractal Design did a great job on this one. At $100 it's a little pricey, but it's really **really** good at noise isolation. Watch [this review](http://youtu.be/SRZIdbdcIiUand) you'll see what I mean, he demonstrates the noise isolation towards the end. It's also available in Titanium and White colors. 

-An 850W powersupply? Are you insane? Yes, a little, but it fits in your budget and this thing is *really* good. 10 years of warranty, excellent stability and reliability, and enough wattage to house **2** of the most power hungry single GPU cards on the market (that's why the 2 R9 390Xs are in the build, check the wattage on pcpartpicker) for future upgradability. Yeah, it's a pricey investment now, but you'll be able to rely on it for at least 10, and probably many more years. It's expensive now, but it will power this, and your next, and possibly your next computer. You can afford it, so I'd go for it if I were you. 

Edit: changed the RAM. Lower CAS latency is beneficial for video rendering, RAM speed doesn't make any difference because the speed at which the RAM runs is way faster than your SSD/HDD regardless of the RAM's speed, but lower latency allows the RAM to respond faster, and in turn give you a little bit faster rendering times. Or something like that. I'm not sure. Possible, because Seasonic makes it and they're good, but I don't know. Never heard it before. Or you could just not go through all that hassle and use /r/hardwareswap instead.. Is your CPU voltage on auto, or have you manually found how much you need for 4ghz? If it's on auto you can almost certainly lower it manually by quite a lot because auto mode almost always applies more voltage than it actually needs. I bet you could run 4.5ghz with less voltage than auto mode is giving it at 4.0ghz. Beautiful build, Shingeki No Kyojin is awesome, I can't wait to see the second season animated, I'm not gonna spoil, but some really crazy shit is gonna go down and Mikasa is gonna kick ass as always. If you don't know how and what to do exactly with the voltage, feel free to contact me and I'll help you do it. :) Windows Education is essentially Windows Professional, I believe it even has some more features. I also use it. 

If you need some tips help during your build you can PM me or contact me on Telegram, my name is the same on there as it is here, I'd like to help out on your first build so you don't accidentally break anything :P (not saying that you would, but it could be nice to get some tips) 


Edit: Windows Education = Windows Enterprise. 

http://cdn.liliputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/w10-features.jpgI'm sorry, but this build is just a waste of money, there is no place for AMD processors in 800+ dollar builds, they just don't keep up with current GPUs.

-Much better CPU 

-Z97 motherboard, why? The 4460 can't even overclock.. I know, but you might pick up an unlocked chip later and then you'll be fucked with a H97 board. 

-Cheaper but still great SSD

-Changed the drive to a WD Green drive, 3TB Seagates are unreliable. 

-Cheaper and lower wattage PSU, 750W is a waste of money in this build, either go 650 or 850, because 750 is that awkward middle ground that can easily power this setup, but won't be able to power a second 390, just like 650, but 850 can actually power a second 390.

Such an expensive motherboard is a waste of money regardless of the chipset in my opinion, better save the money. As for H97 vs Z97, I think you should always pick Z97 unless you're on an extreme budget, then get H81, but the price difference between H97 and Z97 is pretty much none existent, so I'd much rather keep the upgrade window to an unlocked chip open than possibly saving 5 or 10 bucks. I know voltage goes down when it's not under load, that's good, but when it IS under load your board probably applies more voltage than necessary. My board on auto mode gives my i5 2500K (Old, I know.) 1.290V-ish at stock speed, that's 3.8ghz, but guess what? I can manually get it to do 4.5ghz at 1.275V completely stable. 


&gt;Do you think it will help lower the temp a bit if I manually set the voltage?


That completely depends on how well you did in the silicon lottery, I won't be able to tell you until you provide some numbers like what voltage it's currently getting under load at auto mode, but if you got even an average chip you can lower your voltage (and temps) by a lot more than just a bit. 


Edit: If you want an easier way to chat, you can contact me on Telegram. I have the same name on there as I do on here. My opinion still stands, get an i3 and a cheap H81 board if you want to be cost effective, but amd just doesn't work for gaming, it will bottleneck the 390 almost certainly in most games. 

3TB drives in general are unreliable from what I've heard, would you be okay with stepping down to 2TB?Here's an updated build with a budget board and an i3, also stepped down to a 2TB drive because I keep hearing that the 3TB drives are unreliable.

Good quality small PSUs, but I wouldn't bother with the regular size ones from Silverstone. There are better options in that field. Telegram is free, so if you change your mind, go ahead :P 

It's just much easier to use instant messaging than refreshing a website every minute to check for new messages, but I have to go to sleep now, so if you message me I won't reply for a good while. It's 5:18 AM here at the moment... That PSU really isn't good, and the SSD isn't either, switch those 2 out. 

The GPU won't be getting 60FPS on ultra settings, what's your budget anyway? What's the price of this build? Where are you buying from? You realise that 3 of your prices are zeros, yeah? Do you already have those components? No, I meant switch the SSD for another one, Kingston's SSDs aren't very good. The PSU should be switched to anything by Seasonic or Superflower, XFX, EVGA's GS/PS/G2/P2/B2 powersupplies (not nex), CoolerMaster's V series.. 

An i7 6700 is way overkill for a gaming build, better get the i5 4460 you were getting originally and putting more money into your GPU. Add me on Telegram and we can talk about your computer more easily. My name is the same there as it is here. USB type A is the rectangle shaped USB port, USB type C is the new oval shaped USB port.

2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 are the verisons, A and C are the shapes. Get a single 8GB stick of RAM instead so that you can upgrade to 16GB later, that board only has 2 RAM slots. The shape has absolutely nothing to do with which generation of USB it is, the Oneplus 2 (phone) for example has a USB 2.0 Type C port, while another phone I forgot the name of has a USB 3.0 Type C port, and a lot of motherboards now have USB 3.1 and 3.0 Type A ports, and 3.0 / 3.1 Type C ports are starting to show up on boards too. The type is nothing other than the shape, the version and the shape have nothing to do with each other. In case one fails.. Or something.. Idk RAM speed and latency are 100% irrelevant for day to day usage, quantity above all. If you're rendering videos then CAS latency could be important, but not hugely. 

Edit: Oh I missed the part where you said APU. RAM speed actually does matter a lot for APUs, and performance improvements are seen until like 2133/2400mhz, so get that. Your motherboard and CPU will be able to handle it no problem, but since that PSU is already so old I would definitely replace it. It isn't a good unit to begin with, and it only had 3 years of warranty when you bought it, so I'd guess that it's near the end of its life.. 

Take a measuring tool and check how much space there is in your case, easy. 1. DVI is much better than VGA. 

2. It doesn't matter what you plug your computer into, really. 

3. Wired will almost always be faster and more reliable than wireless. 

Do you already have all your parts purchased, or would you like me to take a look if they're all good?What is this PC for? Gaming? 

That Kingston SSD is really slow, get a Crucial or SanDisk instead, and that's a VERY expensive case. Have you looked at other, cheaper options? There are a lot better cases for that price, and below that price. 

And the EVGA NEX series is old, and unstable compared to the newer GS and G2 series. I don't think the Hyper 212 Evo is going to do all that well with the powerful and hot 5820K, I'd get a cheaper motherboard and a better cooler. Only a 960 in a build this expensive? Is it a placeholder for a future upgrade to next gen GPUs? Nice PSU choice, but I'd get a 650W unit instead, I think you're underestimating how much power an overclocked 5820K is going to use.

Consider this. 

-MSI has awesome customer support, and they make high quality motherboards. This is a sexy one as well. 

-Much better cooler that nicely fits your color scheme

-Higher wattage PSU so you won't have to upgrade it in the future if you want to upgrade to a power hungry GPU. Do you want to chat on Telegram or WhatsApp or Skype or something? I can help you select the right things if you'd like. Did you select a white case because you want a white case, or is black better? It isn't about needing more power, it's about being a low quality powersupply that could blow itself up since it's so old. You can just go to search and type in my name, I should pop up right there What makes you want the Asus board over the MSI board? You can get a 980 if you want it, but the 960 will do just fine at 1080p, it won't max every single game out, but it'll do great regardless. Superflower Leadex Gold sells for 20 euros cheaper than a Corsair RMi equivalent wattage PSU, so I think that's an easy choice. 

The RMi is the cheapest good PSU series corsair offers. I also have an Asus laptop, and an Asus motherboard, but if getting the MSI board saves you enough money to upgrade something else then it's a good deal. MSI is a good company, they make high quality products and stand behind them with good customer support, there's no real difference between the Asus or MSI board, but I think the MSI one looks better. It's already been said but I'll say it again to confirm;

It's likely to fail relatively soon so don't store anything important on it, but it will work just fine. Go to the seller's website that always has a picture Powercolor is pretty good but their customer support isn't that great Really now? They treat their customers based on the price of the product they bought? That's low. Boils down to the same thing in my opinion Alright, fair enough... Still kinda lame though Is your monitor plugged into the motherboard or into the GPU? Yeah it can still twist, that's fine. A heatsink needs to make proper contact with your CPUs heatspreader, it doesn't need to crush it :P

Don't use Prime95, it became bad a while ago and it can damage your CPU. Stick to AIDA 64, OCCT and IBT. [PCPartPicker part list](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/LV9yCJ) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/LV9yCJ/by_merchant/)

-Cheaper SSD 

-**Much** more powerful GPU, look at that beautiful 980

-Cheaper case

-Cheaper (but still great quality) PSUThe PCI E slot can provide up to 75W of power, so low power GPUs like the R7 250 don't need an extra power connector. That's upsetting :(Lol what is this post about? Bottlenecking or a whiney cousin? mock him about it, live up to your name.

-Much more cost effective cooler, this will do a great job and you can upgrade it later if you have to. 

-Cheaper motherboard 

-Cheaper RAM 

-Much, much more powerful B-Stock 980

-Cheaper and in my opinion better case

-**Much** higher quality PSU 

Order the GPU as fast as possible, it will be sold out again in no time. I've seen it. 

EVGA's B-stock sells out *really* fast, so if you want it, buy it. You can always sell your 960 if Corsair ends up replacing it. What you paid for your PSU, motherboard and that strange box case makes me sad :(

Nice build though, I'm jealous of that power. That powersupply makes me sad :(

Did you really get it for free or did you actually buy it? It's not Raidmax, that's True. It'll do :P[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Kp9F23) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Kp9F23/by_merchant/)

-Slightly faster CPU

-Cheaper SSD

-Better GPU 

-Much better PSUThe cheapest one that looks good. 

Consider a 1x8GB stick if your motherboard only has 2 RAM slots. [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/M7WPrH) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/M7WPrH/by_merchant/)

-I added a similar looking CPU cooler since the price on yours is a 0

-Great motherboard, weigh its features against [this one](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-z170extreme4#viewImages) and see which one is better for you. The ASRock board also fits your color scheme nicely. 

-Changed the RAM to a kit, but then realised that your separate modules cost the same and are faster, but I'm too lazy to change it back. 

-Changed the SSD to a 10GB more Crucial model, I don't know anything about Silicon Power so I'd rather not recommend them, I know that Crucial is good though. 

-Changed your GPU to a 980Ti, get messed up. 

-Changed the PSU to a cheaper 1000W unit, also made by Seasonic. I think you're overestimating how much a Fury uses, it's actually quite efficient, even if you add another fury the system won't use 800W, so you have 200W of overclocking headroom. That's more than enough I'd say. 

Don't listen to that guy saying that you only need 8GB of RAM, I regularly use 6-ish GB and every time I want to play a game I have to close all my shit. Fuck that, if 16GB fits into your budget, go for it. Just take the two components to /r/hardwareswap and be done with it I agree. Always get a single more powerful card over a dual weaker card setup, this way you don't lock yourself in. If you get a single card you can add another one later. A single 980Ti will get 40+ FPS on almost every game at 4K max settings (minus AA, but you don't need AA at 4K)

Do the applications you use actually benefit from hyperthreading? If not, get a 6600K instead and save yourself some money, or put it towards a more expensive motherboard / case. 

I don't think you'll actually use 32GB of RAM, but then again, I don't know the programs you're using. I'd say buy 16GB of RAM now, and if it turns out not to be enough, buy another one of the same 16GB kit and just add it.

Changes;

-Cheaper motherboard 

-Less RAM 

-Changed the 390 SLI to a single 980Ti 

-Changed the powersupply to a much, much more reliable and better performing unit. [Review here](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=377) /r/hardwareswapuk then? It wouldn't outperform it by a lot, but as I said, getting a single more powerful card is better than getting 2 weaker cards Yeah, via USB. You download the ISO, and then you use Rufus to put it on a USB stick. Alright, cool :) If you want some help with the building then you can contact me on Telegram or WhatsApp or something if you want. My name on Telegram is the same as it is on here. CPUs with an X after them are also unlocked. Like the i7 5960XIt's shocking to me that people still don't know about ninite, it's been around for so long and it's so awesome. Intel build. 

If you want to shave 4 dollars off, ditch the WiFi card and get this board instead. 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-h81mitxwifiThere is absolutely zero need to upgrade your CPU, I'd pick up a cheap cooler like the Hyper 212 Evo and overclock it a little bit, and I'd replace the powersupply. Put the rest into a new GPU, maybe add a second 780 Ti? 

Edit: Nevermind on adding another 780Ti, it only has 3GB of VRAM, that's not gonna cut it anymore. Sell it on /r/hardwareswapuk 

I think this would be the best way to spend your money;

-Added a good but cheap CPU cooler. 

-Added a 980Ti, you could go for a more expensive model if you wanted to. Sell your 780Ti on /r/hardwareswapuk. 

-Added a **really** good powersupply that you won't have to upgrade or replace in at least 10 years, because that's how long its warranty is. Your Corsair CX unit isn't very good, and it's not even really a 750W unit as it doesn't handle heat well at all and can't output 750W when it gets hot, think about high load situations in summer. It uses mediocre capacitors which reduce its lifespan, that's the reason it only has 3 years of warranty. Corsair doesn't expect this thing to last all that long. There are other ways of getting Windows that cannot be mentioned on this sub :lI've bought 3 of those "illegitimate" keys and they all work, so..The only thing I think was a bad choice was the 2x4GB RAM kit, now you've locked yourself into 8GB of RAM which you'll find isn't all that much if you're even somewhat of a multi tasker. If you want to upgrade to 16GB you're gonna have to pull these sticks out, sell them, and buy a whole new 2x8GB kit :( 

If you would've gone with a single 8GB stick you could've just added another one later, way easier. Anyway, I like all the other choices. I think spending more money on an "overkill" CPU was a good shot, it will be powerful enough for at least 6 years if you overclock it a little bit. The CPU, PSU and case (granted you like the case) are the longest lasting components in most builds if you pick high quality stuff like you have, nice job :) If you need a bit of help with overclocking, let me know. That's my ceiling, not space. Why does everybody dance around what the actual issue is? Every time I ask someone what the problem with those keys is I just get some dumb answer like "They aren't legit". Well, I have news for you, they're perfectly legit as far as I'm concerned because *they work*, if that isn't legit enough for you then I don't know what is. Giving a billion dollar company 100 more dollars for their overpriced software is ridiculous and I'd rather save my money, I don't give a shit if Microsoft doesn't like it. They should drop the price of Windows if they want people on a budget to buy "legit" copies, until they do, I'll gladly spend the 70 dollars I save by buying an "illegitimate" key on more powerful hardware. Your CPU wouldn't even really bottleneck SLI 980Ti's, people always underestimate how powerful i5s are.Is this build already purchased or what? Your title and post are contradicting each other. 

What does your dad need a 960 for? What is this build gonna be used for?Kingston isn't a bad brand, their SSDs are just garbage.What is "He likes to game"?

He likes to play Battlefield 4 on max settings, or he likes to play casual games at around 45FPS on whatever settings give him a fun experience?

Is the RAM DDR3? If the parts are 10 years old it may be DDR2 RAM, and the HDD could be an IDE drive. Is it a SATA drive?Come on now, Kingston makes good RAM.. And... Yeah, nvm, they make good RAM, that's it.I edited that comment, what about the RAM and HDD?

Does your dad use a 1080p or a 720p monitor?But is the RAM DDR2 or DDR3? And is the HDD an IDE or a SATA drive? If the stuff is 10 years old like you said it's likely incompatible by now.I disagree. I am using 3.7GB of RAM right now with 10-ish tabs open in Chrome, Skype and Hangouts running and Steam in the background. If I wanted to play a game I would have to close some stuff, and I'm not even using as much RAM as I normally am.. Add a Skype call, a few more Chrome tabs, a Telegram chat and boom I'd be around 5GB of usage.Does he have a case with decent airflow?That could be a problem with overheating.I am an idiot, nevermind.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/fDDfbv) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/fDDfbv/by_merchant/)

-Cheaper and equally as good CPU, games don't benefit from 6 cores.

-Better and higher capacity SSD

-**Much** better PSU


Edit: Are you okay with buying second hand? You could get a really good computer if you purchase certain parts second hand.Well suggest a browser that isn't broken then? I want plugins and I want a bookmarks bar that's all I'm asking. I haven't been able to find a replacement. 

10 tabs isn't even that much, I regularly have 20 open and none of them are open just because I forgot to close them. I close the tabs that I don't use. [Could have gotten a 980 with that budget without making any sacrifices in reliability at all :/](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WpghHx)

Build looks great though, enjoy.I'm not sure, I've heard that they are but I can't confirm.You should be fine for a few more years, but if you want to play it safe you can replace it. No harm in replacing it if you have the money to do so. Powersupplies aren't that expensive in the US. Wait for an EVGA G2 or P2 unit to go on sale again, a few weeks ago there was an [EVGA P2 650W](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=446) on sale for 90 dollars, that thing scores a 10/10 if you disregard the Value category and the complaining about a second 4 pin CPU connector.. 

Keep an eye on /r/buildapcsales EVGA's B - Stock isn't second hand, well, technically it is. It's products that people returned, they were factory reconditioned and they come with a year of warranty. If a GPU is going to fail, it would do it within a year. Probably within a few weeks. 

It's completely safe to buy those cards, and EVGA's customer support is awesome, so I'd you'd have issues with your card you'd be in good hands. Oh, alright.. I'll try closing it at least once a day then. Thanks for the tip.  I've tried Firefox but I can't get used to it :/Nvidia cards age like 580 = 670 = 760 = 950 so yeah, a 950 is about as powerful as a 580. It is still more than powerful enough. CPUs haven't evolved much in terms of raw horse power, the only reason to really upgrade would be for features or less power consumption. I also highly recommend /r/hardwareswap, you can get a pretty awesome PC for 300 dollars. You can use the Windows licence that's on the hard drive of his current computer, and you can probably re-use the hard drive too. Could you give me some detailed information (model number?) of the computer he's using so I can see what's in it and if anything is reusable? I'd imagine the hard drive is, and the optical drive, maybe the case if it has even halfway decent airflow? 

If you buy from /r/hardwareswap make sure you use PayPal to pay, and only send money as goods &amp; services, never as a gift or something because you don't get buyers protection with anything other than the goods &amp; services payment option. Also ask the seller to provide a picture of whatever you're buying with a little note beside it spelling out your and/or his name. 

If you want some help in picking / hunting for parts I'd like to help, I'm also currently building an ultra low budget PC for a friend so I think it'd be fun to help you and chat about it. I also have a 2500K, mine is sitting at 4.8ghz, I can help you overclock yours if you want. You'll definitely notice a performance improvement by overclocking, especially in CPU intensive games, and Sandy Bridge chips are generally great overclockers so it is really simple, and really safe (depending on how far you want to go) with a decent cooler. What cooler do you have? Contact me on Telegram if you want, I can help you with it. My name there is the same as it is on here. It's a bot and it gets triggered by some stupid bullshit, this thing is all over reddit and it replies to messages instantly. I posted a comment and immediately got a reply by that bot, like, within 5 seconds of posting. It's a rough estimate to compare older cards to newer ones without having to google, it's not completely accurate. Ah alright cool so you've tried before. 2 hours in is pretty close to figuring out how to get it perfectly stable, so you're off to a good start. It could've bluescreened because it tried to go to sleep while running a stress test, who knows.. We'll find out I guess. 

That cooler is pretty good so you should be able to get a decent overclock with that. 

Edit: dug up this comment from a few days ago, might be interesting for you to read. 


https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3nyiny/build_help_put_together_an_new_rig_thanks_to_you/cvsd5gvNah, overclocking is really easy and safe if you do it properly. I also have a 2500K with a 1.1ghz overclock (3.7 to 4.8ghz), that's a pretty huge increase :P 

If you'd like me to help you overclock yours, feel free to contact me on Telegram and I'll help. My name there is the same as it is here. GTA V sucks a lot of VRAM but high settings should be doable as long as you don't exceed your 2GB of VRAM. Overclock the core and RAM as far as they'll go for max performance, there's no risk as long as you don't touch the voltage, and even if you slide the voltage all the way to +100mV, it isn't that much, and it won't kill your card to do so, but once you touch the voltage you lose the safety guarantee. It has only grown by [about 50%](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3nyiny/build_help_put_together_an_new_rig_thanks_to_you/cvsd5gv) since Bloomfield according to my quick research a few days ago :pPlanetary Annihilation for example has no problem using over 8GB of RAM in large systems with lots of units spread across several planets. 40C under load? I find that hard to believe, sounds almost impossible, what kind of godly cooler do you have? Telegram is free, by the way, and it shares nothing other than your username. Be extremely careful with powersupplies, especially second hand ones. A low quality PSU can fail and take your components out with it. Make sure whatever PSU you end up buying has a good review from jonnyguru or some other reputable powersupply reviewer.Powersupplies can last **very** long, but you just need to make sure that the unit you buy is actually good and not all that old. I wouldn't buy a 6 year old PSU for example, but I'd be okay with a 2-3 year old one granted its a high quality one by Seasonic or Superflower for example. 50C on the stock cooler sounds literally impossible, but alright.. If you say so.. Do you live on the north pole perhaps? I have a 2500K at 4.8ghz so trust me when I say that I know how far SB can overclock :P 

It's insane, I can get my chip to 5ghz stable and still have okay temps with a Corsair H60, but the voltage is too high for comfort. 4.8ghz only needs 1.330V. I am shocked. What program are you using to stress test and what are you using to check temperatures? You should be able to get a really nice overclock if your temperatures are so low. Second hand everything based on an overclocked i5 2500k or newer should run you about 300 dollars without the GPU, add a new (or used?) 980Ti and you're at 800-1000 dollarsThe CPU will be fine for a few years, upgrade the GPU. Stick to NVIDIA, your powersupply can't handle anything all that power-hungry. I think you should wait. Keep an eye out on /r/buildapcsales for a CPU+Mobo combo deal (there's a 5820K + MSI Krait deal for $500 right now but that goes over your budget.) and a good deal on a GPU, also keep an eye on [EVGA B stock](http://www.evga.com/Products/ProductList.aspx?type=8) for if that gets restocked, $250 for a 970 is pretty damn good. Holy fuck the prices... This is worse than Australia, RIP :(Is the 950 not the "m" version? That called coil whine, it comes from the GPU when it's under load and it's extremely annoying, but not dangerous. You could return your GPU and get another one, most of them don't have it, some do. 

Edit: sometimes it stops when you overclock slightly, put +20 or something mhz on the core and the memory and see if it stops. Or you could just not use anything other than toilet paper, you don't actually need alcohol, that just makes it easier. If you take your time and keep rubbing the CPU with a clean piece of toilet paper until the CPU and heatsink stop staining it it is just as clean as it would be with alcohol. 


I would rather clean it without any alcohol than with 70%, that's really low and I'd be worried about residue from the leftover 30%.Really? Buying? Man... Why? 

Build one instead, it'll be much better than a pre-built piece of shit like that. Gotta factor in the cost of Windows which the pre-built pc companies don't pay the full price for, so the low budget pre-builts are harder to beat than the higher priced ones, but nonetheless I'm almost done putting a build together and it's better than this one. If OP is a student or has an old computer that he can pull the license off of he can ditch the 100 dollars for Windows, and get a waaay better computer than this thing.

-Same price. 

-Quad core CPU, you don't need 6 cores, and this chip is known to be a decent overclocker so you'll get a nice and easy performance boost there. 

-**Much** faster GPU 

-Windows, mouse and keyboard included. If you can get Windows from Dreamspark (student program) or if you can get a key from an old computer, then you can get an even better systemIf it doesn't help, you can just return your GPU for a new one. They'll both be about the same, both are probably 2GB versions and the generational jump from 8xx to 9xx probably closed the gap.. Let me check 

Edit: nvm the 860m is faster. 

I have a laptop with an 860m and it's a pretty capable little GPU. No problem playing any of the recent games including GTA V and Dying Light at 1080p, recently played those. Can you get Windows for free from your school, or from an old computer? If you can, I can configure an even better PC than the one posted below for the same amount of money. If you can get Windows from Dreamspark, look what you can get. This would be an awesome 1080p high/ultra gaming rig.

-Much better CPU. 

-Much better GPU 

-Super reliable powersupply, unlike the pre-built/included with case pieces of shit on the other 2 builds. If I were you I'd invest 25 bucks in a Hyper 212 Evo (or something smaller if that doesn't fit in your case), that will keep your CPU super cool, and quiet. The stock cooler can't be keeping it under 40C, that has to be a mistake. Download [Core Temp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) and leave that open in the background while playing your game, or running a stress test or something. The max temperature will be monitored in the background. 1. How old is the PSU?

2. No, just format it and reinstall Windows all clean and fresh, it will have no problems then. You could use the money you save with re-using the drive and (maybe) the PSU? To upgrade to an i5 4460, or to get a 120-256GB SSDIt isn't the greatest PSU, uses cheap Teapo capacitors and those don't have the longest lifespan. I'd just buy the Thermaltake PSU, it's a good unit and it has that really nice discount right now so it's a good deal. What's the other specs of your computer? If it has something like an i5 2500K you won't have to upgrade that, it's still a really fast CPU. That leads me to a blank page :P Yeah an external drive would be the easiest way. I'm not sure about the RAM actually, that's weird. Pick another kit instead to be safe. 

The PSU comes with all the cables you could possibly need.Ah okay, there we go. You can re-use the RAM too, unless you need more than 8GB :D

Edit: I can't read. I thought it was 2x4GB but it's 2x2GB, never mind :PIt doesn't matter really, the difference in speed is only a few percentages. I just think that a 1x8GB stick is better because the motherboard you're getting only has 2 slots, if you fill them both now you won't have space to expand later on if you want to/need to.

Look at them discounts! All of those deals are from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/new/) If you want yeah you can do that, for a total of 10GB, should run fine. I'm not entirely sure though, I've heard you shouldn't mix and match RAM because they have different timings.. You're gonna have to Google that one.

-Cheaper APU with integrated graphics 

-Faster single 8GB stick 

-250GB SSD on discount, this will give her a much faster computer and a better experience, I don't think your mother in law will ever use 200GB worth of pictures. 

-Nicer caseThe 500GB version is also on sale, an SSD will just hugely improve the speed of the computer, and it's more reliable. 

The AMD intergrated graphics on the A6/8/10 are actually really powerful, and capable of playing real games if she ever wants to, on low setting and depending on what game maybe 720p, but still. Much more powerful than Intel integrated graphics. 


Edit: link to the daily deals page 

http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=lp_10095090011_gbps_tit_s-3_0382_c04950d2_GB-SUPPL?rh=i%3Aelectronics%2Cn%3A10095090011%2Cn%3A10095090011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;node=10095090011Shitty SSD and PSU, the EVGA NEX (G1) series is old and unstable compared to the GS and G2 series, better not get it. All higher end stuff by Seasonic, XFX high end units, EVGA GS and G2, Cooler masters V series, Superflower Leadex units (EVGA G2 and P2 units are literally rebranded Superflower Leadex units)Do note that the intergrated graphics in the Pentium are extremely weak, your mom doesn't need the powerful cores the Pentium has, and would benefit more from stronger graphics I think. It's not a high quality PSU but it will do I guess. I'd never run such expensive components off a PSU like that, but it will do. You're kidding right? A 760K bottlenecking an R7 265? Nah dude. 

It's a pretty decent budget CPU, it'll do nicely paired with a 750Ti or 950 or something of that calibre. That's a pretty good deal. Nice. I suggest going with the 7950 that /u/mrcooliest linked, it's a pretty good deal, unless you're okay with buying second hand. You can pick up a 7970 or a 280X for around 100-120 bucks on /r/hardwareswap, quite a lot of people are selling them. 

Overclocking your CPU should give you a decent performance boost in CPU bound games but it won't make a huge difference. Hmm you're right about the R7 265, but the CPU is pretty decent, especially when overclocked, it's not horrible like you're saying. No upgradeability though, that's True. Should've gone with the unlocked Pentium instead. What's that powersupply? I know high end Rosewill stuff is good, but I haven't read anything about the Hive ones yet. I think there's better options for 60 dollars. It will increase the lifetime if your parts, the overall stability of your system and it will give you peace of mind that it will never fail. 550W will be enough, but cutting it close if you overclock your CPU far. Go for 650W to be safe and to help efficiency.  

Quality of a PSU isn't determined by its efficiency rating, so if you want to buy a new one, let me know and I'll help you pick one out. http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0550v1

Only 10 dollars more expensive, and a lot better, right? Don't get the powersupply, the NEX series is old and unstable compared to the GS and G2 series. Also look at /r/hardwareswapuk to sell your stuff. Nice build, but the NEX series from EVGA is an old design by FSP (I think) and it isn't nearly as stable as the GS (Seasonic) and G2 (Superflower) series, there are much better units for that price. Just letting you know so you can factor that into the next build you configure.  The EVGA GS units are made by Seasonic, but yeah, the Seasonic G series perform better, and are slightly more expensive. Both units are really good, though, and I think the G2 series beats the Seasonic G, and they're the same price last time I checked, right? 

Edit: wrong, the G2 650W is 20 dollars more expensive than the Seasonic G 550W, and the G2 series doesn't have a 550W model. Yes you will be fine. This whole build is pretty much perfect, the only thing I disagree with is the damn optical drive. Who uses those? Pull one out of an old trash computer if you have to but don't waste money on it, you could buy a nice game with 18 dollars :P

The PSU and case are the longest lasting parts of a build, usually, so you don't want to skimp on those. You haven't on the PSU, that's an excellent unit, don't change it, but the case is a bit meh in my opinion, maybe go with something like a Phanteks Enthoo Pro M, or a Fractal Design Define S, or something a little more expensive if you can afford it. What is this build for? Gaming? If yes, there's absolutely no increase in performance if you buy an i7. Overclocking stability is also directly influenced by how stable the voltage your PSU provides is. If your PSU has a lot of voltage ripple your CPU voltage won't be as stable either. 

Your CPU will be good for at least 4 more years in gaming, even longer if you overclock it. 

[This PSU](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20650y1) is really, really good. Amazing ripple suppression and voltage regulation, and awesome quality components. 7 years of warranty as well, beat that.. .....what? What's a PSU cooler? You mean a CPU cooler? If you want to overclock yes you do, but if you don't then the stock fan that comes with your CPU is good enough, it's just a bit noisy. You probably should, the stock one is loud. Get a Hyper 212 Evo if it fits in your case. Flickering lights makes me think your card isn't being powered properly. 

Turn your computer off, flip the PSU switch off, and push the GPU into the PCI E slot, and push on the PCI E power connectors from your PSU. Graphics card. This is so massively hugely insanely overkill for CS:GO, you can build a PC that runs CS:GO maxed out at 100 FPS for like 300 dollars, make it 450 for 300  FPS... Why do you need so many frames anyway? 

Edit: Australia, okay, make it 600, but still... lol what? 160W.... Alright... A low power Skylake i3 and a GTX 750Ti

Skylake i3 should take about 50W and the 750Ti takes under 75W so that should be okay.. Get a single 8GB stick instead, that way you don't fill both slots on your motherboard and you keep the expandability window to 16GB open. 

Buy Windows 10 instead, the price difference is very small and it's much better than Windows 8.1

Aaand you really should consider a Z97 board and an unlocked CPU, you don't necessarily have to overclock now, but you'll have the option to do it later. Your budget allows it, so I don't see why you wouldn't. You'll be able to squeeze every last bit of life out of your CPU before it becomes too weak by overclocking it in a few years when you need the extra power. Buy a halfway decent CPU cooler like the Hyper 212 Evo and overclock your CPU a bit, and upgrade your GPU. The GPU is the limiting factor in your build, the CPU is fine. Whatever works for you, the pentium is pretty strong but mostly loved because it can overclock, it doesn't do amazingly well at stock speed. The i3 will do great at stock speed, though, but the price is still really high. You could wait for it to drop :/

Maybe find a board that takes DDR3 RAM? Do those exist in Mini ITX form factor? True. "PICK THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOTHERBOARD I CAN FIND!" isn't a good way to pick a motherboard :P 

Can Cinema 4D utilise **all** of those 14 cores? If yes, then it's a good choice. 

Watercooling your GPUs is pointless, get a card with a good cooler... OH wait, no, Titans don't have custom coolers. How about that. If you're going for the watercooling approach, get an EVGA card, they won't void your warranty when you take the cooler off as long as you send the card back to them with the original cooler on it if you ever need their customer support, which is awesome, their support is great. 


About the case, nah, you don't need an EATX case, regular ATX cases are already pretty big and unless you need MOAR GPUs (more than 3) you'll be okay. Most ATX cases can hold 3 GPUs.

-Quieter and more reliable CPU cooler, pumps in those tiny all in one watercoolers tend to fail after a few years, big air coolers like this never fail. Maybe one of the fans will die after a few years, but you'll notice that and you can replace it no problem. If the pump on your watercooler fails while your machine is rendering overnight I can't imagine the outcome being very good. 

-Changed the motherboard to a cheaper ATX board by gigabyte, look it up and read about its features. I think you'll like it. 

-Switched the GPU to an EVGA one for reasons mentioned in my other comment, but custom watercooling is expensive. You need a waterblock, a pump, fittings, tubing, a radiator, a reservoir, and a lot of time and effort to put the loop together and test it. It's probably a little more expensive, but completely maintenance free and a lot easier to buy [this](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-12gp41999kr) and be done with it. 

-Switched the case for an in my opinion much nicer one. 

-Switched the PSU for a more powerful one, 3 Titans (your plan) will use more than 1000W. A 980 has one **thousand** CUDA cores less than a Titan X, that's a ton. Always better to do a clean install than an upgrade. Such an expensive rig shouldn't be paired with such a 'meh' PSU. 1. Yes, an Intel i5 2500K and an AMD HD 7970 

2. Nothing 

3. Yes

4. I dont buy consoles anyway

5. Drop their damn prices a little bit and stop using shitty TIM between the die and the heatspreader, they should go back to soldering on the consumer chips like they're doing on the Haswell-E chips and like they did on the Sandy Bridge chips.[PCPartPicker part list](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/Y2vkMp) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/Y2vkMp/by_merchant/)

-Much better CPU for rendering and multi core purposes like streaming and video recording. 

-Slightly cheaper but good enough CPU cooler, feel free to step up to the 110i again if you want. 

-Different motherboard to fit the CPU, MSI makes really good stuff. 

-Changed the GPUs to the cheaper but equally as good if not better G1 Gaming cards by Gigabyte. 

-Cheaper case, watch some reviews about it, I think you'll like it. 

-Waaaayyyyy better PSU, the 5820K is really power hungry when overclocked, you're gonna need a 1000W PSU, but it fits in your budget so get it. EVGA's G2 series have 10 years of warranty and they are incredible performers. 
You can also overclock the 5820K to around 4.7 Ghz with a little bit of luck, but even at 4.4 Ghz which is achievable on almost every 5820K it will wreck the 6700K, 2 more cores and 4 more threads, dude, an overclocked 6700K can't beat that. Why are you going for the 5960X? It's not as powerful as the 14 core Xeon as far as I know, and it produces a lot more heat.

The 980Ti hybrids are a good idea, but that case is just ridiculously expensive. You can put the radiators from the GPUs where ever you want, in the front, in the bottom, in the back or on the top. Where ever they fit. 

You're also gonna need a way bigger PSU if you plan on having 4 980Ti's and a 5960X, take what pcpartpicker.com says with a grain of salt, I always add 50W to it, and then you have to factor in the extra power consumption that comes from overclocking, so a 5960X and quad 980Ti's is probably gonna end up drawing like 1450W.

Here's what I suggest, if you want to keep the 5960X anyway. 

-Cheaper case 

-Much larger Titanium efficiency powersupply to reduce the insane power bill you will get by the end of every month. Can the wall sockets in the UK even power this thing? Lol. 

Edit: want to chat about this on Telegram? That'll be a lot faster and easier. Go for it :PYou always have the off chance of getting a component dead on arrival, but that also applies to pre built machines, including Macs. 

Something can always die, but if you get high quality components, nothing will die if it isn't already dead when you bought it. You'll only encounter issues with your computer if you mistreat it, or use it wrongly. I built my computer 5 years ago and I haven't done a thing to it other than dusting it out every few months, but even that is easy with the cases we have nowadays, magnetic dust filters and stuff are great. 

It took me 8 hours and it wasn't my first build, but I was taking my sweet time with cable management and I ran into some issues. I banged his mom and he threatened to kill me, don't do it, it's a trap! You can be my friend *without* banging my mom. How about that? :) &gt;now all i want in a mobo is 6ish usb ports 1 gpu slot 2 dimm slots preferably 3 pin fan headers and preferably a ATX form factor for around about 70-100 AUD (1 usd = 1.38 aud)

There you go, you answered your own question. Get a motherboard that has exactly that, or more, for that price, and you're good. MSI, Gigabyte, Asus, ASRock, and EVGA all make good motherboards. EK has some really good fans for not too much money, I think they're static pressure fans only though. Corsair Airflow series are supposed to be good, and they look really good. I don't know too much about fans, though. OP's build in reddit format.

Are you looking to cut the cost down with a minimal performance decrease? Because that's possible. All boards are good, really, even the absolute cheapest board you can find is good enough. The smaller you go the more time consuming it becomes :P 

Works the same the other way around, though, it'd take a long time to build an insanely huge dual CPU and quad GPU monster. Lol what? Like literally every case on the market is compatible with your build. A bit of advice though, don't buy that powersupply. It's bad.

-Removed the cooler. 

-Cheaper motherboard (Z97 is a plus, for if you ever want to pick up an unlocked chip second hand or something). 

-Cheaper SSD. 

-Cheaper and 4GB version of the 960.

-Much more awesome powersupply. 

-Standard optical drive. 2 hours is just plain unrealistic even for an experienced builder. You have to set aside a whole day, you could be done in a few hours or it could take the whole day if you run into issues, and you have to account for any possible DOA parts so don't expect to have it up and running at all until it turns on :P The 4790K is a pretty good overclocker in my opinion, its stock speed is 4 Ghz, you can get it to 4.6/4.7 Ghz without going into the uncomfortable voltage levels.. The i5 4690K is even better at overclocking, its stock speed is only 3.5 Ghz, and it can also reach 4.6/4.7, that's like 1.1 Ghz of overclocking, pretty huge performance increase if you ask me. 

Edit: Yes, I know overclocking used to be better. I have a 2500K (3.3 Ghz stock) at 4.8 Ghz, I know that's a 1.5 Ghz overclock, but I don't think it makes the more recent CPUs bad overclockers. All Corsair PSUs are pretty trash other than the RMi/AX/AXi/HX/HXi units. Lol that list is pretty bullshit it even contradicts itself by listing the Corsair RM series in 2 different categories, and by placing the GS series in decent (they are discontinued for one, and were rebranded CS units afaik.) Exactly. I always say don't even bother with Corsair PSUs at all unless they're on a discount and cheaper than the competition. I disagree strongly. There are some incredibly sexy looking units out there by Superflower, EVGA, XFX and Seasonic. Corsair also only makes black PSUs, Seasonic and Superflower have really nice white units. What the hell are those? I've never heard of any 'x' suffixed series from Corsair...

Disregard all prices, I used links from the stores with the best pictures. Not the lowest prices. 


&gt;Seasonic ones look like sketchy prebuilt ones, even though they are always top quality.

Lol yeah that's True for their cheaper stuff, they spend no money at all on the looks, which is good in my opinion. Budget units don't need to look good, every single bit of money should go into reliability and stability. Do you care about speed on your hard drive or does it just need to be as reliable as possible? [The cheapest and slowest option, WD Green drives are power saving drives, they aren't very fast but they are reliable because of their low RPM.](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd30ezrx) 



[The more expensive 4TB WD Red drive, these drives aren't really fast either. Faster than the Greens, though. They're meant for use in servers, 24/7/365 operation and they come with a 3 year warranty.](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd40efrx)

[And the most expensive, but also fastest WD Black drive. These are meant for speed, they're the fastest hard drives available as far as I know, and their reliability is also incredibly good. They aren't meant for 24/7 operation, though, but for regular desktop computers. They come with 5 years of warranty.](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd3003fzex) Huh. Nice. Will look into it tomorrow, gonna sleep now :pBecause there is no answer to your question I'm not evading anything. 

I know the ASRock Anniversary boards are good, but all boards in that price range are good. I'm telling you, they're all the same. You just need to pick the one with the features you want. Fallout is full of shit. If it actually required an i7 it wouldn't be able to run on any AMD processors at all, because they just don't keep up with i7s, an i5 will do just fine. I'm saying it now and I'll tell you I told you so when Fallout 4 comes out :PIf you're serious about backups of your irreplaceable data like pictures you may want to consider either Cloud storage, or a RAID 1 setup. A hard drive can be as reliable as you want, but failures can **always** happen, to any drive, from any company, without warning, at any time. The only way to protect your data is to have multiple copies. Even a Raidmax PSU can power a 50W system I'd think :PI'll break my own neck if it isn't Naaaaahhhhhhh it isn't worth it to upgrade for you man, your Ivy Bridge CPU is still powerful enough, you'd be wasting money by upgrading to Skylake, wait until the next socket. Overclock your Ivy Bridge chip if you need to. It's about more than raw speed, SSDs don't have any moving parts so they're faster from the start. It may not copy and paste large files as fast, but it will find everything much faster without any delay. You could've gotten a 980Ti in a budget like this :/


Overkill cooler, overkill motherboard, overpriced RAM, overpriced PSU.. The i7 is questionable but I guess it is helpful when streaming/gaming so that's good. Nice build anyway, enjoy. &gt;No, I don't overclock. I buy the performance I need (or, really, want). Even before my computer was more than a gaming machine, I saw little point in overclocking (and I date back to building my own 386s out of scavenged parts, mind). I do use my rig for more nowadays, however, and reliability is more important than raw performance.

You seem to believe the common misconception that overclocking causes instability and shortened lifespan of your components, this is absolutely not True, this is as False as False can be. If you overclock properly, and test your overclock properly before going back to regular usage you won't have any issues at all. The reason we run several dozen hours of stress tests after overclocking is to **ensure** stability. If your overclock lives through 12+ hours of 3 different stress testing programs it is just as stable as the stock speed would be, and if your voltage isn't too high you won't see any degradation over time that can make your overclock unstable. The thing that causes the shortening of the lifespan of your CPU is voltage, **not** clockspeed. Each chip is made differently, and some are better than others (I mean within the same processor, every i5 2500K for example is different.). My 2500K at completely default BIOS settings gets 1.310V from my motherboard, that's at default 3.5 Ghz, I know for a fact that it doesn't need that much voltage, in fact, I know that my chip can do **4.5 Ghz** at 1.290V. That's *less* voltage than it was getting at default settings for 3.5 Ghz, and I've been running it like that since I got it in 2011, I recently bumped it up to 4.8 Ghz @ 1.330V and it's running like a dream. 



&gt;Oh, and because my computer is used for business purposes as well as gaming these days, I can write off a fair amount of my upgrades. It's a little tough to pass off a video card as an IT consulting expense but the other components certainly count. :)

Oh man how jealous I am... Depending on what your job is, though, you can easily write a GPU off for *dat CUDA* performance in your business applications like professional rendering and 3D modeling, etc. Sounds like you're living the life, free components and a family with custom computers.What..... Why and how are so many people getting free Titan X's? Please explain..

Look how beautiful..


-Unlocked i7 4790K, much more powerful that the locked i5 4690.

-Z97 board with WiFi, because why not. And most Mini ITX boards have WiFi afaik.

-Faster single 8GB stick of RAM. 

-In my opinion much prettier case. Higher build quality for less money, watch hardwarecanucks' review of this case on YouTube, I think you'll like it. 

-And lastly, a cheaper and lower wattage PSU. 850W is way overkill for this build, even when you overclock both the CPU and GPU to the max you'll barely use 550W. &gt;It does tend, however, to cause more hassles with troubleshooting in my experience to get "just so".

Alright, fair enough. It is True that it takes a long time to get an overclock truly stable, and adding or removing anything in your system could cause it to become unstable again, so from an I'd rather not deal with that perspective it's completely understandable. 



&gt;Well, writing them off doesn't mean they're free. That's a common misconception, though. A write off simply reduces your taxable income by that amount, unlike a tax credit which reduces the actual tax paid by a specific amount. In reality, I often run out of income I'm really able to reduce using writeoffs before I run out of things I can write off, but every little bit helps.

Oh, alright. Thank you for that clarification, I'm 18 so I don't really know much about how this works yet, and I live in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, so things might be completely different here. I read a thread on this sub yesterday talking about writing components off and I assumed it meant you'd get a full refund or something, which seemed silly to me, and I guess it was. 


&gt;I enjoy it quite a lot. It doesn't pay quite as well as my old gig at Microsoft, but the flexibility in my schedule allows me to be a better parent, which more than makes up for it.

Congratulations, you win parent of the year award. Not to play drama Queen, but my parents are too busy to do anything with or for me 90% of the time, so I appreciate you being so mindful about the time you spend with your kids. Keep that up. 


&gt;But, yeah, I love my job and life is, generally speaking, good. It's got its ups and downs, of course, but whose life doesn't?

Cats, they don't have downs. Sleep all day and night, play, eat, sleep some more... That's the life...&gt;Yeah, it isn't that they crash all the time. Just more hassle for so little gain that it isn't worth it for me is all. Of course, I get to tinker with the rigs friends overclock, so I guess I get the best of both worlds.
Well, writing them off doesn't mean they're 

The gain is actually pretty huge. My overclocked 2500K outperforms a Skylake I5 6600K at stock speed, so by overclocking I gained ~5 years of development in terms of speed. Sure, I'm missing some features that Skylake and its motherboards have, like M.2 drives, PCI-E 3.0, USB 3.1, lower power consumption, but in terms of speed I'm keeping up just fine because of my overclock, which is quite huge, I'm running a 1.5 Ghz overclock, 3.5 to 4.8 Ghz, and I can't remember the last time my computer crashed, but when it did I added a tiny bit more voltage and it hasn't crashed again since. 


&gt;Yeah, but imagine if cats could play video games too! Man, now that would be the LIFE!

I'd kill for that, oh my. 


Thank you for the information about all that scary adult tax stuff, I'll learn soon enough when I move out :P I know that clockspeed isn't everything, there have been a lot of architectural improvements, and the IPC has gone up a ton of course, but in the single test I've done (Cinebench) my 2500K scored higher than my friend's 6600K at stock speed, and much lower when I was at stock speed (obviously).. Sooo, overclocking has definitely given me a significant boost in performance. **But** if you keep temperatures low with proper cooling and you don't go stupid with the voltage, then there won't be any damage whatsoever, right? No he won't, I think he would've selected an SLI compatible board if he was planning on adding a second card. Good night man, nice chat indeed. Cya :) [Seasonic Snow Silent](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story2&amp;reid=409) series and [Superflower Leadex series](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story2&amp;reid=370) are also sold in white. Yeah, it's probably the PSU if it's some random company. It likely can't even deliver 620 watts, but give us more info. A picture of the unit? A model number? A real company name? Yes definitely enough for a nice firework show. 

Buy a new powersupply dude, don't be cheap. If you buy a decent unit now it'll last you for like 5 years, or if you buy a really good unit it can last for over 10 years. It's a good investment. What's your budget for the PSU? Buying from the US? I'll help you pick a good unit. [Oh my god that's gross get it away from me](http://www.d9commerce.com/api-connect/image_store/20150206/9335-7104-20150206-5670.JPG) 

Lol, yeah, look at the 12V rails, they're only capable of delivering 475W combined, and even that is a stretch. Throw it away before it breaks your GPU if it hasn't already, or sets your house on fire. It's really, **really** bad, the other commenters here aren't overreacting. [Look at this](http://www.d9commerce.com/api-connect/image_store/20150206/9335-7104-20150206-5670.JPG) 

Lolnovo wants to burn people's houses down... &gt;550w-650w unit from Seasonic, EVGA or XFX.


Give Superflower some love, yo, and Seasonic makes all XFX's PSUs afaik. Don't, that's just as bad. 

What are some stores you can order from? I'll see what the best unit you can get is. Budget? And where are you buying from.....? Superflower makes EVGA's G2, P2 and T2 series actually. The best PSUs available at the moment are by Superflower and Seasonic  Make her read our comments and let her realise her mistake. Great, but expensive, let me check if I can find a cheaper option for you. Eeeeehhhhh, are you sure that's what the 80+ certificate ensures? I thought it was only efficiency. *moms...*I'm just going to link you units in no particular order, they're all incredibly reliable and stable units, buy whichever you want.

[5](http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-power-supply-cp9020081na) PC gods forgive me for recommending a Corsair unit, but this one is actually pretty decently priced in Germany, and it's a great unit.. Sooo.... I guess it's nice if you like Corsair Link? Yeahh... 

[6](http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-power-supply-p1750bbefx) Yeah alright if it blows up at 100% it obviously won't pass, but do they really run it for an hour? I doubt it.. Newegg US and Amazon US? No Polish websites? Shipping must be very expensive from America. [1](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-power-supply-p1550sxxb9), [2](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii520bronze)  and [3](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-ssp450rt) are great units, just compare them and see what wattage you want and which you think looks better. 

The shitty looking 450W unit is 80+ Gold if you value efficiency. It's just overkill, Skylake doesn't produce as much heat as previous generation chips did and a H100i is just unnecessary in my opinion. The colder the better, I guess, but I'm just saying that the money could have been used better somewhere else. There is no reason to get a super expensive motherboard if you don't need any specific features that it offers. Asus also isn't the only good motherboard brand, look into MSI, Gigabyte and EVGA boards too. ASRock is owned by Asus, they use the same BIOS etc. so if you're considering Asus, also consider ASRock, they're basically the same. ASRock is their "value" and "gaming" brand. [Awesome choice.](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=370)I have first hand experience with the 100i, and the pump is indeed the loudest thing in my friends' system. 

If you don't mind the looks of air cooling, stick to it. The much cheaper NH-D14 (or 15, if you like spending money) performs within 2-3 degrees of the 100i, but it's quieter, more reliable and as I said cheaper. It is also bigger, uglier and a ton heavier though so consider that. They're overpriced, and only the RMi/RMx/HX/HXi/AX/AXi are good. Everything else by Corsair is shit, only buy the units I listed in this comment IF they're on sale. If they're at full price, you can get better units for less from other companies. I know that, I know that. Trust me.

A quality unit isn't needed in a system like this, and I meant that a horrible PSU rated at 650W probably won't blow up at extremely low load. PCI E lanes really don't matter that much unless you're going for more than 2 cards Definitely get the MSI 390X it's much faster than a 970 and it has over double the VRAM, not just a little more. Yeah, why wouldn't it be? Gigabyte makes good stuff. You could get a motherboard expensive motherboard, but this build is already very slightly over budget, so that'd be up to you. Mini ITX boards are pretty expensive, but Mini ITX cases are cheaper, so it compensates I guess. That's what I said. 

RMi/RMx/HX/HXi/AX/AXi series are all good, regular RM is only average, and overpriced, and the rest are just shitty for what they cost. CX, CS, GS, VS and TX are all on the 'not worth buying' to 'bad' scale. They are shit for what they cost, and the you get what you pay for rule applies to PSUs from all brands.Dude keep the Seasonic unit! It's likely better than the CM V series unit. I know Seasonic makes CM V series, but I'm not exactly sure what platform it's based on. 

Edit: Oh my that cable management. This is why I don't buy old CM cases, newer cases have so much better cable management options. Build looks great though, enjoy it. What..... What the hell is that processor? Why did you mix a 35 dollar CPU with a 235 dollar GPU? The GPU is gonna be bottlenecked to absolute shit and it's not gonna play any games, at all. Where's your PSU? Delta Electronics? 

And yeah the pentium upgrade would be very good, but also about 120  dollars unless you buy second hand :P Yes, yes, yes. I know I'm late but absolutely yes. It's worth it for 35 bucks. Mine won't overclock for shit, at 66Hz it already starts spazzing out and that little doesn't make a difference.. :(You have some PT Nuke in your distilled water right? Don't just run straight distilled water. You need some sort of biocide or shit can start growing in your loop and you'll have a bad time. Algae doesn't grow overnight, you're good :P Please get those pictures back, she can't get away with this shit :(Probably.. :(It also comes with an activation key. Downloading Windows is free, putting it on a USB stick is also free, it's the key that costs money :P 


But when you have the disk you should just use that. High Bandwidth Memory 


The name speaks for itself really. It falls behind i3s in gaming, AMD CPUs are useless for gaming right now :(You can play pretty much anything maxed out, or at least high settings. Have you ordered all your parts yet? Which options do you have for the GPU? Can you get an R9 390 for the same or less money? And are there GTX 970s by companies other than Asus?Yes, Asus just isn't the best company to be with due to their shitty customer support, and the R9 390 is slightly more futureproof because it has double the VRAM and it does better at higher resolutions than 1080p, which you might benefit from in the future when you possibly buy a 1440p monitor. http://pc.ncix.com/pcbuilder/pcbuilderpreview.cfm?id=4884179&amp;skus=102345-1-0|96203-1-0|33130-1-0|96905-1-0|57953-1-0|94341-1-0|97531-1-0|110486-1-0|33601-1-0|65701-1-0|104938-1-0|33602-1-0|7842-49



How does that look? Sadly, the selection there is extremely limited which is really stupid, I know they have a ton more stuff than that on their regular site but they won't let you pick from all of it. There's only NVIDIA GPUs there as well. I really don't like NCIX :/


&amp;nbsp;


Do you live so isolated that you can't possibly RMA a part if it turns out to be dead on arrival? This is so strange to me, living in a country the size of your back yard... Yes. I've been using my P67 Sabertooth to overclock my 2500K for years, and am currently overclocking my 3770K on it. Yes. You need a compatible CPU to update the BIOS. Oh jeez.... That's very far from everything :( 


Why do you live so isolated? That's not good Rest in peace. Good luck man. Wipe and reinstall. I have a 7970 and Fallout 4 runs just fine for me. They're hated becasue of NVIDIA fanboys splurging bullshit all over the Internet. I've had an AMD card for 4 years now and it's been awesome. AMD actually keeps driver support up for their older cards MUCH longer and they don't nerf their old cards like NVIDIA. Sounds like you have a virus to be honest. What's CPU usage like? Run a bunch of free virus scanners one by one. Brace yourself for jealous comments about all your cool computers! Enjoy those coolers, should be a good bit quieter! 25% CPU is very high for just browsing. Download and install better virus scanners and run them, or take the easy route and wipe your drive and reinstall Windows. You either have a virus or a memory leak from a shitty program. Nothing like refreshing reddit and seeing a bunch of downvotes for no reason.. You're right, that's exactly what I meant. Did you and /u/grizzlyfox UPDATE your drivers from Catalyst to Crimson, or did you wipe the Catalyst drivers and install the Crimson drivers from scratch? I installed the drivers from scratch after wiping the old ones with display driver cleaner (easy Google) and have had no issues. Sometimes *updating* software can cause issues. Me too, but the misuse of up/downvotes on reddit is so annoying to me sometimes. What virus scanner are you currently using anyway? I think it creates a dump file somewhere which it reads when it starts back up and reopens stuff accordingly, but I could be wrong. I'm just guessing. Nah. I didn'tWell then... Crimson includes a few very specific Fallout 4 improvements. Go update. That's a very average antivirus, try a few other programs. Security 360, Avira, AVG, Avast, etc. Just Google for some good ones, install them all, and run them all one by one. Just because one virus scanner doesn't find anything doesn't mean there's no virus. Also take a look here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide/A better question would be, who the hell doesn't notice their FPS being absolute garbage because their GPU is throttling to shit? Crimson drivers have been fine for me, so ehh... I'd say give it a shot. You can always roll back to Catalyst if you wanted to. Fair enough.. You're right Card overheating because of the custom fan profile bug? It's bullshit nowadays. Their drivers have been fine for years. No clue what he's on about, never heard that before so I'm gonna call bullshit. I agree with the guy telling you to wait a month so you can just buy the i5 right away. Very nice. Now pick up some cable extentions from Cablemod for 30 bucks to hide those ugly PSU cables. Interesting. Why haven't I heard of this before after many months on this sub? Actually, all you need is a 24 pin extension cable which is like 6 bucks. That 24 pin is the one I was talking about, with the rainbow colors. Lol. Kaboom might happen. Quite literally. Contact Corsair, their customer support is incredible and you still have warranty on your HX850. I had slight coil whine on my HX850 and they replaced mine with a HX850i no questions asked. The whole process took about 2 weeks from start to finish. Damn you, man.. Now I want skittles... Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ITX. It's tiny but it has awesome airflow. The Air 240 is huge for a m-ITX case.. MSI Afterburner records temperature history. Just check the graph after gaming. I don't think you understand what you're talking about Not gonna happen man Then why the hell is it in this thread in the first place? Anywhere from 2 hours to a couple of weeks if you have a DOA part. Nobody can tell you. Get a second hand 2500K, 2600K or 2700K. Or an Ivy Bridge CPU, just update your BIOS before installing one of those. That case really sucks, there's no room for any cable management at all. Don't get it. It's not overclockable at all and the CPU is slower than your 3570K but it's not actually *slow* or anything. +1 

Cryorig H7 or those big Phanteks coolers, they come in white too. That's bullcrap and GeForce Experience is garbage. Check out the DX Racer. I'd buy it if it didn't look so 'gamery' You can pay them a temporary deposit and they'll send you a new one before you send the defective one over. They call it an express replacement. 0 downtime apart from switching the PSUs out. For free if you're a student*Thermaltake P5? Lots of games actually see big performance improvements from i7s over i5sIt seems like you're trapped in 2009! Do I need to send help to free you? 


Just kidding, but yeah a lot of games are starting to use hyperthreading and benefitting from i7s. Fallout 4, GTA V, Cities: Skylines, and a lot more games that I don't know from the top of my head see big performance improvements between i3s, i5s and i7s. RAM speed is also starting to matter, with a big difference showing between 1333Mhz RAM and 2400Mhz RAM. Well, time to accept that games are evolving. Take a look at this thread.

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3w7kly/discussion_ram_speed_doesnt_matter_for_gaming_or/Some of your links are irrelevant because they're tested with integrated graphics, and it's been common knowledge that integrated graphics on your CPU hugely benefit from RAM speed, so remove those links as they contribute nothing but confusion to this thread. 


I'm not sure. 
https://www.dreamspark.com/student/It was deleted a long time ago, comments deleted by mods are still visible to the one that posted them, but are deleted to everybody else. Get a better cooler, something cheap like a Cryorig H7 or Hyper 212 Evo will do just fine, and see how high you can go with 1.3V :D


That's still far below danger zone and those coolers should handle it just fine.https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/3va720/i_delidded_my_3770k_after_putting_it_off_for_a/




&amp;nbsp;


Don't do it unless you have a backup CPU or the money to buy a new one if you fuck up. [Beautiful](http://m.imgur.com/rjQ6CzQ)Acer Predator X34. Good luck getting your hands on one right now. New batch coming December 12th.Are you, /u/democratic_anarchist and /u/Pat-Roner also this knowledgeable about headphones? If yes, would you mind if I asked you guys for some help in choosing my first pair of proper headphones? I've always used $20 pairs of IEMs.. It's time for an upgrade. Then don't delid :) It's super simple, just read what you type in your head and insert a comma wherever you naturally 'break' while speaking. 


Comma = short pause 

Full stop= long pause or end of sentence. Umm... Just Install it like you do on a regular hard drive..? I don't understand your question. Contact Sapphire and get a new one. The 6700K has higher IPC, which means Instructions Per Clock, which means it can do more per cycle. It's faster at the same speed, yes. What PSU do you have specifically? What resolution are you playing at? There's no reason you should be wanting to upgrade if you're at 1080p, the 970 is awesome for that. Hmm, thank you, but I'm looking for closed back over the ear headphones since I'll be traveling with them quite often. Public transport mostly. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been looking at these 3 in particular;

1. ATH M50X's

2. Beyerdynamc DT 770s (30Ohm versions) 


3. AKG K545s


&amp;nbsp;


And I was wondering if these are good choices. There's so many different brands and models, and I don't quite understand most of the reviews because they use terms that I don't know. 


I listen to rock and metal, ranging from softy stuff like Halestorm to all hell breaks loose Thy Art Is Murder. My favorite band is somewhere in the middle, being A Day To Remember. I'm looking for balanced sound, but I do want the bass to be clearly there when it should be, I love 'feeling' the bass when it's there, and I really hate how S's sound very sharp in some songs. I like listening at high volume, so sharp S's can hurt my ears if they're really bad. If you need more information to give me proper advice then please ask. Thank you so much for being willing to help.Yup. IIRC they'll charge $20 if you don't have the receipt and then honor the warranty anyway. Display driver uninstaller They always have you pay for shipping one way. Apart from that their customer support is absolutely incredible. Nothing but good experiences with Corsair here. 
You had shitty teachers, they should've explained it to you instead of just saying that you were doing it wrong. 


There's a difference between commas and full stops, get that down first. Look at my previous post where I explained the difference, and then read what you just typed in your head, you'll hear what you did wrong. You'll get there with some practice and patience, and it really helps you communicate on the internet. They are all roughly  the same price where I live right now (Netherlands), does that change anything? And I have no idea where to go to try headphones, but I'll look into it, thank you again :) Should be plenty to power that card.. Maybe something else is wrong. Alright, thank you. I was starting to lean towards the AKGs but now I'm back on course for the M50X's. I'll find a store that sells them and go have a listen. I've heard bad things about them leaking a lot of sound, is there any truth to that? 


While I'm at it I might as well ask this, too, in about a year or so I'll be moving into my own place and I'll be dropping around 500 euros into an audio setup for my living room which will be used for the TV and music. I'm not a huge fan of surround sound with speakers in every corner of the room, I prefer audio coming from where the TV is, or at least from only one side of the room. What would you recommend there? Thank you for all the help, again. I appreciate it. The audiophile and headphones subreddits don't allow posts asking for buying advice. Just contact them, be polite and hope for the best. If one rep says no, try again. Different people, different answers. Sapphire generally has very good support and they're cool with losing some money to gain a returning customer. They've gained me as a returning customer for sure. Soooooo... Where's that 2500K now? That CPU is extremely weak, and you paid 90 bucks for it and the motherboard? Ouch :(

Other than that it's a nice build, enjoy. Awesome. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you once I've tried the M50X's :) You can just leave the +2 pins off, and only plug the two 6 pins into the card.Overclocked 5820K and a beefy cooler will destroy the 6700K in multithreaded workloads, and match it in gaming. The Nano breaks the 970 in half. RIP. Get glasses. 


I just got my contact lenses yesterday and went from 25% vision to 85%-ish, it's amazing... The world is so beautiful now. Lol. Yeah, what the fuck is that PSU? That's not even close to what one should put in a system 50 times less expensive than this... Jeez... Which PSU and which i5 do you have exactly? This is important. Are you rich? Good luck.. I have Dreamspark myself and I get it all for free. Weird. Windows 7, 8, and 10, and a bunch of other Microsoft stuff. Awesome, thank you! I'll let you both know when I've tried and/or bought a pair :) Yeah, way too much. Go X99. MOAR CORES! Something like that, yeah. Ask for a price check on /r/hardwareswapuk Could it possibly be in an envelope on its way to my desk? :oEnable turbo boost and all that stuff in the bios and it will Either way those 200mhz don't really make a difference. Maybe you need a better cooler, I don't know. Seconded. 



And it looks a whole lot better. I've never really heard of Cryorig until like a month or two ago, are they new, or have they been an unnoticed company for a long time? It's okay I'd say. Contact Sapphire about it and ask them if it's normal, it's their card, they'll know best. It's marketing bullshit. It's a digital signal which doesn't improve with higher quality cables *at all*. Yes, idiots buy those cables, that's why stores still sell them. It's fucking stupid. I love the term doormat, I don't know why, it's just funny to me.. Well they're not pushing air through the GPU no matter how hard they try, so I still don't really get it. If you switch back to HDDs as main storage on another PC for a while you'll understand what we're talking about. Lol. Beautiful build, nice component choices. 37 degrees at idle seems a little bit high, but it also depends on how warm it is in your room and stuff. How did you apply your thermal paste? Do a stress test and let me know what the voltage/temperature is like if you want to make sure it's all okay. Because PCBs are solid, air doesn't go through solid objects :P 

The fans are just there to deliver air to the GPUs fans, which will handle the actual cooling of the GPU.. Uhh.... Nothing, really.. You didn't give any information, why do you want to upgrade? Never get a dual GPU setup over a single much stronger card setup. Ditch the dual 970s and get a 980Ti, also step down to an i5. Games don't benefit from hyperthreading. Get the i5 4690K instead, and a single 980Ti. Dual 970s perform slightly better, on games that actually properly support SLI, but SLI is louder, runs hotter, consumes more power, doesn't scale optimally (2 cards isn't 200% performance, more like 170%) and going SLI initially completely locks you into that. A single more powerful card can be put into SLI by adding another one in the future.

Here's my suggestion. Dropped the i7 down to an i5, and added a good looking and good performing cooler so that you can get a nice overclock going for your CPU intensive games. You might see a small performance increase in those specific games by going for an i7, but it's honestly not worth 100 extra pounds, unless you're planning on streaming, video editing, or anything else that benefits from more processing threads. The motherboard I picked here is also a lot better in both the looks and the  functionality / performance department, and I switched the  GPU to a single 980Ti for reasons mentioned in my other comment. You could also get the MSI version of the card if you prefer its looks, and lastly I switched the PSU out for a beefier 850W unit which c you'll need if you want to SLI 980Ti's or do anything crazy in the future. A powersupply like this is a long time investment, don't be scared to blow some money on it, it'll last you well over 10 years. EVGA's G2 series are some of the best powersupplies you can buy right now when it comes to stability, reliability, performance and warranty. 10 years of warranty, granted you register the product, but still. That's insane. Use AIDA 64, it has a built in stress test, and built in monitoring of everything you need. Download it, install it, open the program and press the little graph icon top left somewhere. Then you'll see a bunch of tabs, you're gonna want to go to the Statistics tab and then press start bottom left. Let it run for 2-5 minutes or so and then take a screenshot of all the info on the statistics page. I'll take a look at it and tell you if it's okay. 

Did you put the line horizontally or vertically? Because the CPU die under the heatspreader runs vertically iirc, so if you put the line horizontally you likely don't have full/proper coverage. Fair points, I love the look of AIOs (and custom loops even more) and how compact they are, but my experience with them is that the pumps are often loud and weak, and fail after a few years. Corsair does provide great warranty, though, so I wouldn't worry with their AIOs, but I tend to stay away from all other companies except EK of course. Awesome. Let me know if you need any help building.Voltage seems a little on the high side for 3.9Ghz, you could probably do 4.2-4.4Ghz with that amount, but temperatures aren't even touching 60 degrees so that's awesome. Your temperatures are great, don't worry :)The real question is, should you be buying an AMD CPU. Is this rig gonna be for gaming? For any kind of gaming at all you're gonna need a GPU, or go with a Skylake i3 (hugely better integrated graphics) Well, the Skylake i3 can't be hugely more expensive, so it'd be a good investment. The integrated graphics on the Haswell i3 is just garbage and it won't play any games at all. There are cheap Skylake boards that support DDR3 memory, but faster memory will improve the integrated graphics performance. 


You don't need the hyperthreading, but the integrated graphics of the pentium is even weaker than the i3, soo... The idle temps are probably because your Windows power plan is set to performance and your CPU is locked at max frequency, which isn't a big deal, but you can set it to Balanced if you want.

The reason for the voltage being on the high side is because your board gives your CPU the voltage it *thinks* it needs, but that doesn't mean it actually needs it. If you want help with overclocking I'd be glad to help. you could run 3 970's on a 750W PSU if you wanted :PLol no your CPU is more than powerful enough for at least 2-4 more years. Overclock it and you'll get an extra year or so on top of that.

Upgrade your GPU and maybe get a better CPU cooler for a nice overclock if you want.Why? 750W is plenty for 3 970s, a 970 uses 150W.


150W x 3 = 450 + rest of the system = 650-ish.EVGA B2 is a high quality PSU, second point is True though.

edit: OP has a B1, nvm, it's mediocre.All you need to know is that you don't want to go over 1.35V, you want to stay under 80 degrees, and you want to test for stability for at least 24 hours. 


Set the voltage to what you want by using offset mode +0,080V (that should get you around 1.35V, increase or decrease the offset by whatever you need to get it as close to 1.35V as you can, and then keep increasing the multiplier until it becomes unstable. With 1.35V you can expect around 46 multiplier which is 4.6Ghz.


If you want to play it safe, though, stay at 1.3V. [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/r3CVNG) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/r3CVNG/by_merchant/)

This APU will perform much better than a GT 610, the fast memory is necessary for the integrated GPU so don't get slower memory, and the keyboard/mouse combo seems perfect for your needs. You realise that he has to build 10 of these systems and you just made it more expensive right? :PI'm not trying to have a pissy fight with you, I'm just trying to get OP the cheapest build that'll work for what he needs. All those changes aren't only 30 dollars, more like 70, if not more, which means 700 dollars because OP needs to build 10 of these. But the 5800K has worse integrated graphics, and it's only a few dollars cheaper, so that isn't worth it in my opinion. What poor quality parts are you talking about? The PSU? It isn't the best, no, but it's not terrible either. I do agree that the Seasonic units would be more reliable so it might be worth upgrading those, and it's OP's choice if he wants to spend extra money. That APU will max CS:GO out at 70+ FPS so you'll easily get over 100 at lower settingsAll done in the BIOS, you can use CPU-Z and AIDA 64 to do voltage monitoring and stability testing. I bought a 7970 4 years ago and I'm still getting driver updates. AMD's drivers are nowhere near as bad as people make them out to be, I literally haven't had an issue in 4 years with my card. Your CPU won't really bottleneck anything, maybe in some games but generally it's still fast enough especially at that overclock. APUs benefit hugely from fast RAM, that's why, and the  EVGA 500B has to be with a rebate or something which doesn't count. You have 600 dollars worth of mail in rebates, those don't count, so your build is hugely more expensive. While I wasn't aware of the fact that AMD's Linux drivers are so bad, you're also unaware of how integrated GPUs use RAM, so don't call us idiots for your lack of knowledge. You can try an RMA on that GPU, tell them you spent a lot of money on a completely silent system and the coil whine is ruining it. Coil whine can get worse over time, don't ignore it, MSI should replace it and I think they will :) 


That said, I love the build, that case is beautiful, how's the quality of the side panel? Tempered glass? At 125 dollars? Damn, that's a pretty great price, tempered glass isn't cheap. I will definitely consider this over the Ncase M1 for my future Mini ITX build. Currently the 980Ti is the strongest single GPU card on the market, and you need 2 of them for 4K Ultra 60+ FPS. That's what I thought haha, I was like what the heck, that tempered glass panel alone has to cost like 100 dollars. Alright, slightly disappointing :PPascal will have 10x the compute performance or something. Not actual gaming performance. 


2016 on the red side has absolutely nothing interesting at all why would you think that? Don't worry about it. Don't look anything up, just ignore team red. Walk on. The Asus version of the 390 actually has really really bad thermals, so not all brands are okay. OP, get the Sapphire, Powercolor PCS+ or MSI R9 390.Don't buy the Asus version of the R9 390 that one runs really really hot,  up to like 85 degrees, their cooler sucks ass. Get the Sapphire, MSI or Powercolor PCS+ 390.Yeah sure, just make sure your motherboard supports SLI. Dude, don't watercool a server build. Get a small noctua cooler for silence and reliability, the tiny pump in the H60 doesn't like running 24/7 and will fail eventually. No, that powersupply is really bad. Why would you go Skylake with DDR3? Get DDR4, you'll be able to re-use those sticks in future builds. It's the new standard. Since you don't have any radiators, why do you have a static pressure fan? Look up what the difference between **S**tatic **P**ressure and **A**ir **F**low fans are.

Only about 60 dollars more expensive, it has a waaaaayy better PSU and DDR4. This way you won't have to buy new RAM (or a new PSU) when you upgrade your CPU / motherboard in 5 or so years when DDR3 won't be supported at all anymore. What is Zen? Zen is nothing. Don't worry about this "Zen" thing, OP, it's nothing interesting. Team red isn't working on anything at all. **Walk on.**The water would stop flowing and the cooler would just stop working, and in turn your system will overheat and shut down. Why would you build from scratch and spend more money than you have to? The XFX PSU is a really high quality unit by Seasonic and it'll live for at least like 10 years, and RAM lives forever, so if you buy DDR4 now you won't have to buy RAM for your next build. That doesn't have anything to do with what I said :PYou make absolutely no sense at all. Yes. Nah. Better build it yourself you'll get a better computer and it will be cheaper, you won't get any pre-installed bullshit and you'll know exactly what goes into your computer and how to fix it if something happens. I'll put a build together for you, hold on. Well surprise surprise you are being ripped off by a store. Not as badly as you could be, but they're definitely not giving you the best they can for \u00a31500.


You didn't mention some important details like, what do you value in your computer? Reliability? Silence? Raw performance? What color do you want your case to be, and would you like a side panel window? Do you need peripherals included in the \u00a31500 budget? Mouse? Keyboard? Do you need WiFi or is cable okay? Do you want the ability to add a second GPU and run SLI later down the road? One last thing. Would you like your computer to be normal size, small, or *really* small? Would you mind if the WiFi adapter plugged in the back via USB or do you prefer it being internal? If internal, it's gonna be cheap (\u00a310) and green and ruin the look of your build, or it's gonna be more expensive (\u00a340) and black and it'll look good. Mind you the rest of the build is already \u00a31495, but it has better specs than the build you got from the store, so I can move stuff around and get it under 1500 with the more expensive black WiFi card too.

Then here it is. 


-Same CPU, but you need to understand what the **K** at the end of Intel CPUs means. The K suffixed Intel CPUs mean that they are unlocked and can be overclocked on a **Z** prefixed motherboard, both K and Z parts are slightly more expensive than the locked versions, so if you have no interest in overclocking you can save around \u00a3100 by going with the i7 6700, non-K. I personally always get overclockable parts, and overclock them, because I feel like it's worth the extra money for the extra performance you can get by overclocking, but it's up to you. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Similar CPU cooler. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Sexy white motherboard that's also really high quality. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Double the amount of RAM. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Double the amount of SSD storage, and a 2TB drive. If you're one of those people, like me, that will never in their lives fill a **1**TB drive up I recommend you drop the 2TB HDD entirely, and bump your SSD up to a [1TB](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz75e1t0bam) drive. SSDs are expensive but so incredibly worth it, they're so fast and everything instantly becomes so much less frustrating because of the ridiculous speed of the drive. SSDs also are much more reliable than HDDs and they live longer. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Much better powersupply, the EVGA G2 series are some of the best powersupplies you can buy. The 650W unit has 7 years of warranty, if you want 3 years more than that you can step up to the 750W G2 unit or the 650W P2 one (that's P for Platinum) 

&amp;nbsp;

-Simple and sleek minimalistic case, optimised for silence. Good airflow, solid build quality, what's not to like? The Phanteks Enthoo Pro is a great alternative, Google it and see if you like that more. Both of these cases are also available in white if you prefer that. 

&amp;nbsp;

And lastly the GPU, this is the quietest and coolest 980Ti's out there, and it's white/silver-ish. Gigabyte did an incredible job on this cooler, there's not much else to say about it, I've played with it first hand in a friend's computer and it's a beast of a card. Doesn't matter if he didn't specify, it's obvious, rebates take weeks/months to actually go through, if they even go through. It's not worth the hassle. Bottom line is this;

EVGA for the best customer service and a decent/good cooler

MSI Gaming for the second to best customer service and a good cooler

Gigabyte for decent service and the best cooler. The Gigabyte 3 fan one is the coolest running 980Ti as far as I know. Get an i5 4460 and a B85 or H97 motherboard, and consider upgrading your powersupply too. The CX750 is pretty bad. In the summer it turns into a 650W unit. It's karma for buying a shitty PSU. 

Just kidding, but it sounds like your new GPU is faulty. Sounds like your GPU is being a bitch indeed. Have fun/good luck dealing with Asus customer service. You have to upgrade the powersupply first, there's nothing you can do without upgrading that. EVGA will take care of you. Be nice to the support rep and they might even send you a 970 in return for the trouble. Their customer service is awesome. Oh god. Those rainbow cables from the PSU don't look good. I think your PSU is a piece of shit. What exact model is it? Depends. Do you value efficiency and modularity? Umm.. Do you care if the PSU is energy efficient? 

Modularity is the ability to take cables you're not using off the powersupply so that they aren't in the way. There are non-modular units with all cables attached, there's semi-modular units with the cables you're guaranteed to need attached and the rest you can plug in if you need and there is fully modular which means you can remove all the cables. Why? He should just get a good 650W unit that he can use for the coming 10 years. Money well spent. Depends. Are you able to play the games you like to play at decent framerates and settings? Yes? Keep it for a while longer. No? Replace it. If you're willing to buy second hand, get a 7950 or an R9 280 / 285 or a GTX 770/760/950/960 or something along those lines.Holy fuck this is so overkill for light gaming. Lol.

You can step down to the 6600 non K if you're sure you're never gonna want to overclock (I don't see why you wouldn't, it's kinda stupid not to..) 

Cheaper and equally as good CPU cooler 

Good motherboard

16GB of RAM is more than enough 

3TB drives, especially Seagates, fail fast. Western Digital Black drives are super fast and they come with 5 years of warranty. 

R9 390X isn't much better than the 390, it's not worth 100 dollars. 

Cheaper but arguably better PSU. It's a little less efficient but it has 3 years more warranty (10 years) and it's super reliable. 

Aaand a better monitor. 4K, IPS and Freesync. IPS looks WAY better than TN, don't buy a TN monitor, 4K looks so good, why would you ruin it with TN? Depends on what you want to play of course. These questions can't be answered without more info. http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii620bronze


Seasonic is one of the best powersupply manufacturers around, their stuff is proper quality. Reliable as anything. Burn it with fire. 


Don't plug your poor 970 into that abomination, please. That's a decent card for your needs. Slightly stringer than a 750Ti. See if seller will do 80 since it's an old and weak card. It may be slightly exaggerated but EVGA is known to replace defective GPUs with higher end ones. R9 390 will max / almost max all those games out if you can afford it. Meh, I'm not a fan of Asus GPUs. The EVGA GS unit is much, much higher quality than the Corsair CX one. Corsair CX PSUs aren't very good at all. Are you sure your care won't fit it? Pretty much any decent size case will fit an R9 390 Hmm, alright. Check Phanteks' cases out, they're awesome. Dude I was being sarcastic and Zen is actually looking to be really good. Interesting update.. Hey man, tell OP, not me. OP wants 4K monitor, OP gets 4K monitor, and it's very useful to have do many pixels outside of gaming too y'know? :pI really like cpu monkey, is that actually accurate? I think so.. I wouldn't consider Corsair's RM series very good tbh, they're 'okay' at best. The RMi and RMx series is where it's at. 

EVGA's GS series trample all over the Corsair RM series. Brand loyalty is the dumbest thing ever and I'll never understand it, unless said brand actually makes awesome products for a good price, which Corsair doesn't. At least not in the PSU market. I'm assuming they are just benchmarks ran at stock speed, at least the Cinebench scores seem to match up with the scores I always see, so I'm guessing it's good. That's pretty fastThat's pretty cool. Dude just because something is broken out of the box doesn't mean it's bad or you should recommend against it. It happens to the best of the best companies, manufacturing defects are literally unavoidable


Your build looks great though, how's the front intake on that case? I don't see any mesh in the panel. Looks great, good component choices. Why the R4 and not the only slightly more expensive and better R5? And buy an aftermarket CPU cooler as soon as you can, the stock one sucks balls. Because it's super cheap and it does everything you need[Does that thing even exist?](http://imgur.com/mpqQHIZ) Very pretty, congratulations :) No, the 980Ti is still a stronger card. The Fury X might catch up later when DX12 becomes mainstream, but even then the difference won't be so big. Any reason you're going for the Corsair Air case? Why not something more luxurious and high quality from Phanteks? They make really high quality cases. Check Caselabs out too if you have more money than sense. Only things I'd change are as I said in my other comment, the case, and I'd change the cooler too. Look into the EKWB Predator, it's fully expandable and it is built from off the shelf and really reliable / high quality components. You want room to expand later right? Well, what if you want do do some custom water cooling? The EK Predator will just let you add another radiator, put another component into the loop, refill it and boom! Looks good :DThis is a good option indeed, and I'd like to throw EVGA B stock in. Something like a 770 or 780 second hand shouldn't be too expensive either. Tell them you want your money back and order from another site/country. The Netherlands has 6700Ks in store. Looks like the 6700K is low in stock here too and it's really expensive. 490-ish euros. Have you considered the 5820K instead? That should be in stock and it's only 400 euros Just turn it on and you'll hear your GPU fan going crazy. It's a stress test, let it run for an hour and watch for artifacts on the screen. What are artifacts? Well, basically, anything that shouldn't be on your screen. Lines, flickering, distortion, etc. Have MSI Afterburner running alongside Furmark and check your GPU temperature, clock speed, and usage. The bigger the better. It's that simple. Maybe consider a Xeon, it's basically a cheap locked i7.I'd ditch the M.2 drive for a regular SATA SSD with higher capacity. 128GB really isn't a lot. You can always add an M.2 drive later You're better off building from scratch to be honest. Teach yourself to save money, it's good for you. You really need to upgrade that PSU as soon as possible. Not overclockable. That's a shitty habit to be honest. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but it's not something you should be doing too much.


If you insist on upgrading, go SSD &gt; PSU &gt; RAM, Motherboard &amp; CPU in one go, expensive one. &gt; GPU &gt; Case. 


When you get a new CPU, get a Skylake one with integrated HD 530 graphics, that will eat your current GPU alive. Comes down to the same thing. It's not meant for overclocking and therefore we call it locked. From 100 to 102-ish, yeah, that'll help so much. Lol. The Noctua NH-D15 performs the same/better and it's quieter, more reliable, but uglier. I came here expecting this to be a question, and I was going to type almost exactly what you said except I used Noctua paste and a 7970.Your 2500K is still plenty fast, overclock it more, it should be able to do 4.6 at least. Thank you. Lol. Then by all means. If you're getting low profile RAM, get the NH-D14, it's even cheaper but it performs literally the same. The newer revision just has a more flexible fan mounting solution Yeah, seems like they are. Hot running piece of shit cards :P 

Edit: Why the downvotes? The running hot part is completely True, and that they're pieces of shit was obvious sarcasm. Do I really need to put /s after *everything*? Jeez. No, all Asus 390s run that hot, the cooler just really sucks. Check reviews. He could hair dryer the stickers until they become easy to remove and then stick them back on later. I've done it on a Gigabyte card and sent it in for warranty just fine a few months after. Just don't damage the sticker. That MSI board isn't the best for overclocking though, it has a pretty shitty power delivery system. I'd get this instead;

-The Hyper 212 Evo is more than good enough to keep the 6600K cool. My friend has it on his 6600K overclocked to 4.8Ghz and his temps are in the high 60s/low 70s.

-Better motherboard. See those little squares on the left and top side of the CPU socket? As far as I know, the more the better when overclocking. 

-16GB of RAM because why the heck not. It fits in your budget, go for it, I've ran out of RAM before with 8GB and it sucks. 

That is indeed pretty amazing. No other results other than his comment, that's crazy. Hadn't thought about it like that yet. It's only the Asus 390s that are this bad, the Sapphire Nitro 390 doesn't even touch 70 degrees when gaming, and goes slightly above 70 in Furmark. Asus makes shitty AMD cards, they should just become an NVIDIA only brand. What's your budget? Interested in overclocking? After doing more review reading I'm seeing a lot of mixed results. 

These reviews have terrible cooling performance;

I don't really know what to think, but I'd rather stay away from Asus AMD cards anyway. Sapphire is where it's at with good customer support and awesome coolers Return it? Well since you didn't answer my question here you go.

I have not been drunk myself but by dad has been a drunk all my life, and he'd come to me asking if he really did something he thinks he did or said (and apologise for it) when he was drunk weeks, sometimes even *months*  ago depending on how drunk he was, but only remembered it just then. Doesn't matter if you're drunk, your brain still stores all that information somewhere, bits and pieces come back to you for no real reason sometimes, or if you think about it. At least that's what I think anyway, I'm no doctor. Well if people would've read my other comment it would've been clear that that isn't the case. I have an AMD card myself. 

I can see what you mean though when it's out of context. Gigabyte AMD cards are voltage locked, always mention that when recommending their cards. It matters to some people, like me, and having to flash the BIOS to unlock it isn't something a lot of people want to do. How hot is pretty hot? Well they're not pushing air through the GPU no matter how hard they try, so I still don't really get it. If you switch back to HDDs as main storage on another PC for a while you'll understand what we're talking about. Lol. Beautiful build, nice component choices. 37 degrees at idle seems a little bit high, but it also depends on how warm it is in your room and stuff. How did you apply your thermal paste? Do a stress test and let me know what the voltage/temperature is like if you want to make sure it's all okay. Because PCBs are solid, air doesn't go through solid objects :P 

The fans are just there to deliver air to the GPUs fans, which will handle the actual cooling of the GPU.. Uhh.... Nothing, really.. You didn't give any information, why do you want to upgrade? Never get a dual GPU setup over a single much stronger card setup. Ditch the dual 970s and get a 980Ti, also step down to an i5. Games don't benefit from hyperthreading. Get the i5 4690K instead, and a single 980Ti. Dual 970s perform slightly better, on games that actually properly support SLI, but SLI is louder, runs hotter, consumes more power, doesn't scale optimally (2 cards isn't 200% performance, more like 170%) and going SLI initially completely locks you into that. A single more powerful card can be put into SLI by adding another one in the future.

Here's my suggestion. Dropped the i7 down to an i5, and added a good looking and good performing cooler so that you can get a nice overclock going for your CPU intensive games. You might see a small performance increase in those specific games by going for an i7, but it's honestly not worth 100 extra pounds, unless you're planning on streaming, video editing, or anything else that benefits from more processing threads. The motherboard I picked here is also a lot better in both the looks and the  functionality / performance department, and I switched the  GPU to a single 980Ti for reasons mentioned in my other comment. You could also get the MSI version of the card if you prefer its looks, and lastly I switched the PSU out for a beefier 850W unit which c you'll need if you want to SLI 980Ti's or do anything crazy in the future. A powersupply like this is a long time investment, don't be scared to blow some money on it, it'll last you well over 10 years. EVGA's G2 series are some of the best powersupplies you can buy right now when it comes to stability, reliability, performance and warranty. 10 years of warranty, granted you register the product, but still. That's insane. Use AIDA 64, it has a built in stress test, and built in monitoring of everything you need. Download it, install it, open the program and press the little graph icon top left somewhere. Then you'll see a bunch of tabs, you're gonna want to go to the Statistics tab and then press start bottom left. Let it run for 2-5 minutes or so and then take a screenshot of all the info on the statistics page. I'll take a look at it and tell you if it's okay. 

Did you put the line horizontally or vertically? Because the CPU die under the heatspreader runs vertically iirc, so if you put the line horizontally you likely don't have full/proper coverage. Fair points, I love the look of AIOs (and custom loops even more) and how compact they are, but my experience with them is that the pumps are often loud and weak, and fail after a few years. Corsair does provide great warranty, though, so I wouldn't worry with their AIOs, but I tend to stay away from all other companies except EK of course. Awesome. Let me know if you need any help building.Voltage seems a little on the high side for 3.9Ghz, you could probably do 4.2-4.4Ghz with that amount, but temperatures aren't even touching 60 degrees so that's awesome. Your temperatures are great, don't worry :)The real question is, should you be buying an AMD CPU. Is this rig gonna be for gaming? For any kind of gaming at all you're gonna need a GPU, or go with a Skylake i3 (hugely better integrated graphics) Well, the Skylake i3 can't be hugely more expensive, so it'd be a good investment. The integrated graphics on the Haswell i3 is just garbage and it won't play any games at all. There are cheap Skylake boards that support DDR3 memory, but faster memory will improve the integrated graphics performance. 


You don't need the hyperthreading, but the integrated graphics of the pentium is even weaker than the i3, soo... The idle temps are probably because your Windows power plan is set to performance and your CPU is locked at max frequency, which isn't a big deal, but you can set it to Balanced if you want.

The reason for the voltage being on the high side is because your board gives your CPU the voltage it *thinks* it needs, but that doesn't mean it actually needs it. If you want help with overclocking I'd be glad to help. you could run 3 970's on a 750W PSU if you wanted :PLol no your CPU is more than powerful enough for at least 2-4 more years. Overclock it and you'll get an extra year or so on top of that.

Upgrade your GPU and maybe get a better CPU cooler for a nice overclock if you want.Why? 750W is plenty for 3 970s, a 970 uses 150W.


150W x 3 = 450 + rest of the system = 650-ish.EVGA B2 is a high quality PSU, second point is True though.

edit: OP has a B1, nvm, it's mediocre.All you need to know is that you don't want to go over 1.35V, you want to stay under 80 degrees, and you want to test for stability for at least 24 hours. 


Set the voltage to what you want by using offset mode +0,080V (that should get you around 1.35V, increase or decrease the offset by whatever you need to get it as close to 1.35V as you can, and then keep increasing the multiplier until it becomes unstable. With 1.35V you can expect around 46 multiplier which is 4.6Ghz.


If you want to play it safe, though, stay at 1.3V. [PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/r3CVNG) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/r3CVNG/by_merchant/)

This APU will perform much better than a GT 610, the fast memory is necessary for the integrated GPU so don't get slower memory, and the keyboard/mouse combo seems perfect for your needs. You realise that he has to build 10 of these systems and you just made it more expensive right? :PI'm not trying to have a pissy fight with you, I'm just trying to get OP the cheapest build that'll work for what he needs. All those changes aren't only 30 dollars, more like 70, if not more, which means 700 dollars because OP needs to build 10 of these. But the 5800K has worse integrated graphics, and it's only a few dollars cheaper, so that isn't worth it in my opinion. What poor quality parts are you talking about? The PSU? It isn't the best, no, but it's not terrible either. I do agree that the Seasonic units would be more reliable so it might be worth upgrading those, and it's OP's choice if he wants to spend extra money. That APU will max CS:GO out at 70+ FPS so you'll easily get over 100 at lower settingsAll done in the BIOS, you can use CPU-Z and AIDA 64 to do voltage monitoring and stability testing. I bought a 7970 4 years ago and I'm still getting driver updates. AMD's drivers are nowhere near as bad as people make them out to be, I literally haven't had an issue in 4 years with my card. Your CPU won't really bottleneck anything, maybe in some games but generally it's still fast enough especially at that overclock. APUs benefit hugely from fast RAM, that's why, and the  EVGA 500B has to be with a rebate or something which doesn't count. You have 600 dollars worth of mail in rebates, those don't count, so your build is hugely more expensive. While I wasn't aware of the fact that AMD's Linux drivers are so bad, you're also unaware of how integrated GPUs use RAM, so don't call us idiots for your lack of knowledge. You can try an RMA on that GPU, tell them you spent a lot of money on a completely silent system and the coil whine is ruining it. Coil whine can get worse over time, don't ignore it, MSI should replace it and I think they will :) 


That said, I love the build, that case is beautiful, how's the quality of the side panel? Tempered glass? At 125 dollars? Damn, that's a pretty great price, tempered glass isn't cheap. I will definitely consider this over the Ncase M1 for my future Mini ITX build. Currently the 980Ti is the strongest single GPU card on the market, and you need 2 of them for 4K Ultra 60+ FPS. That's what I thought haha, I was like what the heck, that tempered glass panel alone has to cost like 100 dollars. Alright, slightly disappointing :PPascal will have 10x the compute performance or something. Not actual gaming performance. 


2016 on the red side has absolutely nothing interesting at all why would you think that? Don't worry about it. Don't look anything up, just ignore team red. Walk on. The Asus version of the 390 actually has really really bad thermals, so not all brands are okay. OP, get the Sapphire, Powercolor PCS+ or MSI R9 390.Don't buy the Asus version of the R9 390 that one runs really really hot,  up to like 85 degrees, their cooler sucks ass. Get the Sapphire, MSI or Powercolor PCS+ 390.Yeah sure, just make sure your motherboard supports SLI. Dude, don't watercool a server build. Get a small noctua cooler for silence and reliability, the tiny pump in the H60 doesn't like running 24/7 and will fail eventually. No, that powersupply is really bad. Why would you go Skylake with DDR3? Get DDR4, you'll be able to re-use those sticks in future builds. It's the new standard. Since you don't have any radiators, why do you have a static pressure fan? Look up what the difference between **S**tatic **P**ressure and **A**ir **F**low fans are.

Only about 60 dollars more expensive, it has a waaaaayy better PSU and DDR4. This way you won't have to buy new RAM (or a new PSU) when you upgrade your CPU / motherboard in 5 or so years when DDR3 won't be supported at all anymore. What is Zen? Zen is nothing. Don't worry about this "Zen" thing, OP, it's nothing interesting. Team red isn't working on anything at all. **Walk on.**The water would stop flowing and the cooler would just stop working, and in turn your system will overheat and shut down. Why would you build from scratch and spend more money than you have to? The XFX PSU is a really high quality unit by Seasonic and it'll live for at least like 10 years, and RAM lives forever, so if you buy DDR4 now you won't have to buy RAM for your next build. That doesn't have anything to do with what I said :PYou make absolutely no sense at all. Yes. Nah. Better build it yourself you'll get a better computer and it will be cheaper, you won't get any pre-installed bullshit and you'll know exactly what goes into your computer and how to fix it if something happens. I'll put a build together for you, hold on. Well surprise surprise you are being ripped off by a store. Not as badly as you could be, but they're definitely not giving you the best they can for \u00a31500.


You didn't mention some important details like, what do you value in your computer? Reliability? Silence? Raw performance? What color do you want your case to be, and would you like a side panel window? Do you need peripherals included in the \u00a31500 budget? Mouse? Keyboard? Do you need WiFi or is cable okay? Do you want the ability to add a second GPU and run SLI later down the road? One last thing. Would you like your computer to be normal size, small, or *really* small? Would you mind if the WiFi adapter plugged in the back via USB or do you prefer it being internal? If internal, it's gonna be cheap (\u00a310) and green and ruin the look of your build, or it's gonna be more expensive (\u00a340) and black and it'll look good. Mind you the rest of the build is already \u00a31495, but it has better specs than the build you got from the store, so I can move stuff around and get it under 1500 with the more expensive black WiFi card too.

Then here it is. 


-Same CPU, but you need to understand what the **K** at the end of Intel CPUs means. The K suffixed Intel CPUs mean that they are unlocked and can be overclocked on a **Z** prefixed motherboard, both K and Z parts are slightly more expensive than the locked versions, so if you have no interest in overclocking you can save around \u00a3100 by going with the i7 6700, non-K. I personally always get overclockable parts, and overclock them, because I feel like it's worth the extra money for the extra performance you can get by overclocking, but it's up to you. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Similar CPU cooler. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Sexy white motherboard that's also really high quality. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Double the amount of RAM. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Double the amount of SSD storage, and a 2TB drive. If you're one of those people, like me, that will never in their lives fill a **1**TB drive up I recommend you drop the 2TB HDD entirely, and bump your SSD up to a [1TB](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz75e1t0bam) drive. SSDs are expensive but so incredibly worth it, they're so fast and everything instantly becomes so much less frustrating because of the ridiculous speed of the drive. SSDs also are much more reliable than HDDs and they live longer. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Much better powersupply, the EVGA G2 series are some of the best powersupplies you can buy. The 650W unit has 7 years of warranty, if you want 3 years more than that you can step up to the 750W G2 unit or the 650W P2 one (that's P for Platinum) 

&amp;nbsp;

-Simple and sleek minimalistic case, optimised for silence. Good airflow, solid build quality, what's not to like? The Phanteks Enthoo Pro is a great alternative, Google it and see if you like that more. Both of these cases are also available in white if you prefer that. 

&amp;nbsp;

And lastly the GPU, this is the quietest and coolest 980Ti's out there, and it's white/silver-ish. Gigabyte did an incredible job on this cooler, there's not much else to say about it, I've played with it first hand in a friend's computer and it's a beast of a card. Doesn't matter if he didn't specify, it's obvious, rebates take weeks/months to actually go through, if they even go through. It's not worth the hassle. Bottom line is this;

EVGA for the best customer service and a decent/good cooler

MSI Gaming for the second to best customer service and a good cooler

Gigabyte for decent service and the best cooler. The Gigabyte 3 fan one is the coolest running 980Ti as far as I know. Get an i5 4460 and a B85 or H97 motherboard, and consider upgrading your powersupply too. The CX750 is pretty bad. In the summer it turns into a 650W unit. It's karma for buying a shitty PSU. 

Just kidding, but it sounds like your new GPU is faulty. Sounds like your GPU is being a bitch indeed. Have fun/good luck dealing with Asus customer service. You have to upgrade the powersupply first, there's nothing you can do without upgrading that. EVGA will take care of you. Be nice to the support rep and they might even send you a 970 in return for the trouble. Their customer service is awesome. Oh god. Those rainbow cables from the PSU don't look good. I think your PSU is a piece of shit. What exact model is it? Depends. Do you value efficiency and modularity? Umm.. Do you care if the PSU is energy efficient? 

Modularity is the ability to take cables you're not using off the powersupply so that they aren't in the way. There are non-modular units with all cables attached, there's semi-modular units with the cables you're guaranteed to need attached and the rest you can plug in if you need and there is fully modular which means you can remove all the cables. Why? He should just get a good 650W unit that he can use for the coming 10 years. Money well spent. Depends. Are you able to play the games you like to play at decent framerates and settings? Yes? Keep it for a while longer. No? Replace it. If you're willing to buy second hand, get a 7950 or an R9 280 / 285 or a GTX 770/760/950/960 or something along those lines.Holy fuck this is so overkill for light gaming. Lol.

You can step down to the 6600 non K if you're sure you're never gonna want to overclock (I don't see why you wouldn't, it's kinda stupid not to..) 

Cheaper and equally as good CPU cooler 

Good motherboard

16GB of RAM is more than enough 

3TB drives, especially Seagates, fail fast. Western Digital Black drives are super fast and they come with 5 years of warranty. 

R9 390X isn't much better than the 390, it's not worth 100 dollars. 

Cheaper but arguably better PSU. It's a little less efficient but it has 3 years more warranty (10 years) and it's super reliable. 

Aaand a better monitor. 4K, IPS and Freesync. IPS looks WAY better than TN, don't buy a TN monitor, 4K looks so good, why would you ruin it with TN? Depends on what you want to play of course. These questions can't be answered without more info. http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii620bronze


Seasonic is one of the best powersupply manufacturers around, their stuff is proper quality. Reliable as anything. Burn it with fire. 


Don't plug your poor 970 into that abomination, please. That's a decent card for your needs. Slightly stringer than a 750Ti. See if seller will do 80 since it's an old and weak card. It may be slightly exaggerated but EVGA is known to replace defective GPUs with higher end ones. R9 390 will max / almost max all those games out if you can afford it. Meh, I'm not a fan of Asus GPUs. The EVGA GS unit is much, much higher quality than the Corsair CX one. Corsair CX PSUs aren't very good at all. Are you sure your care won't fit it? Pretty much any decent size case will fit an R9 390 Hmm, alright. Check Phanteks' cases out, they're awesome. Dude I was being sarcastic and Zen is actually looking to be really good. Interesting update.. Hey man, tell OP, not me. OP wants 4K monitor, OP gets 4K monitor, and it's very useful to have do many pixels outside of gaming too y'know? :pI really like cpu monkey, is that actually accurate? I think so.. I wouldn't consider Corsair's RM series very good tbh, they're 'okay' at best. The RMi and RMx series is where it's at. 

EVGA's GS series trample all over the Corsair RM series. Brand loyalty is the dumbest thing ever and I'll never understand it, unless said brand actually makes awesome products for a good price, which Corsair doesn't. At least not in the PSU market. I'm assuming they are just benchmarks ran at stock speed, at least the Cinebench scores seem to match up with the scores I always see, so I'm guessing it's good. That's pretty fastThat's pretty cool. Dude just because something is broken out of the box doesn't mean it's bad or you should recommend against it. It happens to the best of the best companies, manufacturing defects are literally unavoidable


Your build looks great though, how's the front intake on that case? I don't see any mesh in the panel. Looks great, good component choices. Why the R4 and not the only slightly more expensive and better R5? And buy an aftermarket CPU cooler as soon as you can, the stock one sucks balls. Because it's super cheap and it does everything you need[Does that thing even exist?](http://imgur.com/mpqQHIZ) Very pretty, congratulations :) No, the 980Ti is still a stronger card. The Fury X might catch up later when DX12 becomes mainstream, but even then the difference won't be so big. Any reason you're going for the Corsair Air case? Why not something more luxurious and high quality from Phanteks? They make really high quality cases. Check Caselabs out too if you have more money than sense. Only things I'd change are as I said in my other comment, the case, and I'd change the cooler too. Look into the EKWB Predator, it's fully expandable and it is built from off the shelf and really reliable / high quality components. You want room to expand later right? Well, what if you want do do some custom water cooling? The EK Predator will just let you add another radiator, put another component into the loop, refill it and boom! Looks good :DThis is a good option indeed, and I'd like to throw EVGA B stock in. Something like a 770 or 780 second hand shouldn't be too expensive either. Tell them you want your money back and order from another site/country. The Netherlands has 6700Ks in store. Looks like the 6700K is low in stock here too and it's really expensive. 490-ish euros. Have you considered the 5820K instead? That should be in stock and it's only 400 euros Just turn it on and you'll hear your GPU fan going crazy. It's a stress test, let it run for an hour and watch for artifacts on the screen. What are artifacts? Well, basically, anything that shouldn't be on your screen. Lines, flickering, distortion, etc. Have MSI Afterburner running alongside Furmark and check your GPU temperature, clock speed, and usage. The bigger the better. It's that simple. Maybe consider a Xeon, it's basically a cheap locked i7.I'd ditch the M.2 drive for a regular SATA SSD with higher capacity. 128GB really isn't a lot. You can always add an M.2 drive later You're better off building from scratch to be honest. Teach yourself to save money, it's good for you. You really need to upgrade that PSU as soon as possible. Not overclockable. That's a shitty habit to be honest. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but it's not something you should be doing too much.


If you insist on upgrading, go SSD &gt; PSU &gt; RAM, Motherboard &amp; CPU in one go, expensive one. &gt; GPU &gt; Case. 


When you get a new CPU, get a Skylake one with integrated HD 530 graphics, that will eat your current GPU alive. Comes down to the same thing. It's not meant for overclocking and therefore we call it locked. From 100 to 102-ish, yeah, that'll help so much. Lol. The Noctua NH-D15 performs the same/better and it's quieter, more reliable, but uglier. I came here expecting this to be a question, and I was going to type almost exactly what you said except I used Noctua paste and a 7970.Your 2500K is still plenty fast, overclock it more, it should be able to do 4.6 at least. Thank you. Lol. Then by all means. If you're getting low profile RAM, get the NH-D14, it's even cheaper but it performs literally the same. The newer revision just has a more flexible fan mounting solution Yeah, seems like they are. Hot running piece of shit cards :P 

Edit: Why the downvotes? The running hot part is completely True, and that they're pieces of shit was obvious sarcasm. Do I really need to put /s after *everything*? Jeez. No, all Asus 390s run that hot, the cooler just really sucks. Check reviews. He could hair dryer the stickers until they become easy to remove and then stick them back on later. I've done it on a Gigabyte card and sent it in for warranty just fine a few months after. Just don't damage the sticker. That MSI board isn't the best for overclocking though, it has a pretty shitty power delivery system. I'd get this instead;

-The Hyper 212 Evo is more than good enough to keep the 6600K cool. My friend has it on his 6600K overclocked to 4.8Ghz and his temps are in the high 60s/low 70s.

-Better motherboard. See those little squares on the left and top side of the CPU socket? As far as I know, the more the better when overclocking. 

-16GB of RAM because why the heck not. It fits in your budget, go for it, I've ran out of RAM before with 8GB and it sucks. 

That is indeed pretty amazing. No other results other than his comment, that's crazy. Hadn't thought about it like that yet. It's only the Asus 390s that are this bad, the Sapphire Nitro 390 doesn't even touch 70 degrees when gaming, and goes slightly above 70 in Furmark. Asus makes shitty AMD cards, they should just become an NVIDIA only brand. What's your budget? Interested in overclocking? After doing more review reading I'm seeing a lot of mixed results. 

These reviews have terrible cooling performance;

I don't really know what to think, but I'd rather stay away from Asus AMD cards anyway. Sapphire is where it's at with good customer support and awesome coolers Return it? Well since you didn't answer my question here you go.

I have not been drunk myself but by dad has been a drunk all my life, and he'd come to me asking if he really did something he thinks he did or said (and apologise for it) when he was drunk weeks, sometimes even *months*  ago depending on how drunk he was, but only remembered it just then. Doesn't matter if you're drunk, your brain still stores all that information somewhere, bits and pieces come back to you for no real reason sometimes, or if you think about it. At least that's what I think anyway, I'm no doctor. Well if people would've read my other comment it would've been clear that that isn't the case. I have an AMD card myself. 

I can see what you mean though when it's out of context. Gigabyte AMD cards are voltage locked, always mention that when recommending their cards. It matters to some people, like me, and having to flash the BIOS to unlock it isn't something a lot of people want to do. How hot is pretty hot? No, every 2 or so years Intel chances the CPU socket and old CPUs physically don't fit in the new socket. Get the non overclocking build if you don't want to overclock, or don't upgrade at all, your 2400 is probably still fine, it depends on how much Fallout 4 uses the CPU. Soooooo, nice build and all, but how do you like *dat monitor*? I'm also looking into upgrading to an ultra wide next year but I can't decide which one I want... :l

-Cheaper and equally as good cooler. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Cheaper and equally as good motherboard. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Cheaper and faster RAM. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Cheaper and faster SSD, stay away from Kingston SSDs. 

&amp;nbsp;

-I prefer the R9 390 over the 970 because it performs slightly better at 1440p and it has 8GB of VRAM which could come in handy if he likes running texture mods on games. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Much, much better powersupply. It's more expensive for but for a great reason. It's 80+ Gold, it's fully modular, and it has **7 years** of warranty. EVGA's G2 series are some of the best powersupplies you can buy. 

&amp;nbsp;

-Much better monitor. It's more expensive but it's 1440p (which looks a ton better than 1080p) and it's an IPS display (which looks a ton better than TN, and is important for any sort of color sensitive work like editing.), so those two things combined will look infinitely better than the 1080p TN panel. Yes, the monitor I selected is "only" 60hz, but really, 60hz is plenty, and I think the huge improvement in picture quality is easily worth the sacrifice of 144hz.http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20650y1


Get this powersupply instead. Yes, it's more expensive, but for good reasons. It's 80+ Gold, it's fully modular and it has **7 years** of warranty. Super stable power delivery, reliability, etc. It's worth the investment. You're welcome. Here's a review to confirm that you made a good choice. 

http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=429A lot more power is an overstatement, it uses like 50-100W more, which isn't that big of a deal and the Sapphire / MSI 390s run really cool. I know they still output more heat but it isn't significant enough to really affect your choice on which one to get unless your powersupply budget dictates that choice. 10 years? That's incorrect, the 650W unit has 7 years according to EVGA's own website iirc. Still, 7 years is incredible.Have you bought any of this yet?

Cooler was indeed unnecessary so I removed it too, got a better 4GB 960 for only \u00a310 more (again), and a better (not modular, but better quality) powersupply. I bet he bought Windows from a place that'll get my comment removed if I mentioned it. The G2 unit has shorter warranty but it's much better. The G1 is an older design and it's less stable than the newer G2 design. Yes, the 970 consumes like 170-ish watts, and the 390 consumes like 250-ish watts, it's still not a big deal though considering you get more VRAM and better 1440p performance. That's my opinion anyway. Have you bought it yet? If not, don't buy it The 500W one is just a lot higher quality and will last longer. The cpu won't throttle with the stock cooler either, it's more than good enough. If there's no airflow then no amount of cooling will keep your CPU from overheating. If it's just recycling the hot exhaust air it'll never get cooler. I didn't say return it, I just said don't buy it, which is good advice. You can get better units for less/just as much money. Yes your PSU is fine, but not the best you can get for the money. Suck it up and buy a new one. Sorry :/TL;DR, but to the title: The 2600K will wreck a 6600K in multithreaded applications. Not in games, though, but it isn't too far behind in games either. 

When you end up getting rid of your 2600K, consider sending it over to me :D


Edit: Overclock your 2600K further, 4.1Ghz is weak for Sandy Bridge. You should be able to do at least 4.5Ghz under/around 1.3V which is completely safe. What do you use your computer for? If you don't use any heavily multithreaded applications you won't get any benefit from upgrading to an i7 and unless you've actually ran out of RAM, there's no point in upgrading it. What monitor do you have? It might be worth it to spend Christmas money on a better monitor and GPU. ^ OP, this. Buy a new GPU, R9 380 (or wait until the 380X comes out very soon) or an R9 390.Nothing by Seasonic is really low quality, just cheap and ugly. The Sandy Bridge i7 will beat the Skylake i5, but the Skylake i7 will obviously beat the Sandy Bridge i7.


By the way, the 6700k's stock speed is 4Ghz, not 4.5 :P You can keep the PSU, but don't overclock on it, and don't keep it for too long. I wouldn't expect it to live much longer than 4-ish years.

Get this. Cheaper and faster. I got a 3770K yesterday and it doesn't seem to be a very good overclocker at all, I only played with it for about an hour and got it to 4.3Ghz at 1.3V, I hope I can go lower than that :/

My 2500K could do 4.7Ghz at 1.3V. My 3770K runs extremely hot, do you think delidding is worth it? 4. Fractal Design Define R5? It's not really small, but it's not huge. If you get a smaller motherboard you could go with something like a Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ITX or an Ncase M1 if you can afford it. And when it does become annoying you can always replace the cooler with a better one. your friend is correct but we can't see your shopping cart. Screenshot it or put the parts into au.pcpartpicker.com What's your budget, what's your current build and what PSU do you currently have?

-Cheaper and arguably better, or at least equally as good motherboard. 

-Cheaper cooler, this will do just fine even for a decent overclock. 

-Cheaper RAM. 

-Much more reliable WD Black drive, has 5 years of warranty.

-Much better case, this is a rendering machine, I assume it will be rendering overnight, and this case is optimised for silence without compromising airflow. You'll appreciate a silent case I think. 

-Much better PSU, 7 years of warranty and much more stable. Check out the hardwarecanucks youtube channel, there's a play list full of case reviews. 380, by far. So far. Try to get the 4GB version. Barely noticeable on the RAM I'd say but it's only 10 pounds more, who cares. Get the CL9 kit. &gt;Have you thought about selling the 3770 and grabbing a 2600k or 2700k?


I haven't, no... That's a good idea, I'll try to trade it on /r/hardwareswap for a 2600K or 2700K or something. I have an i7 3770K, looking to swap it for a 2600K or 2700K. My chip isn't a great overclocker, I haven't played around with it too much but it looks to be around 4.3Ghz @1.3V range, mainly limited by my cooling. Ivy Bridge likes staying cool I've heard. Hmm.. I might just delid it and run a higher overclock.. I have a 2500K, been running it overclocked to 4.5Ghz since I got it 4 years ago, it's still going strong. I pushed it to 5.4Ghz one time to do a Cinebench run and I've had it doing 5Ghz for a few weeks too, this chip is a little monster and you don't have to worry about killing it as long as you're reasonable with the voltage. Stay under 1.350V for 24/7 usage. No it isn't, Seasonic makes really high quality powersupplies regardless of their efficiency.

-Upgraded to Z170 Motherboard to support overclocking. 

-Cheaper RAM. 

-Cheaper SSD. 

-Cheaper HDD. 

-Cheaper GTX 970, the R9 390 and the 970 perform pretty much the same, but the Gigabyte model of the 390 is kinda shitty because it has locked voltage so it can't be overclocked very well. 

-Cheaper case. 

-Cheaper and better powersupply. 

-Cheaper optical drive. It would help if you'd actually tell us which Xeons you got.. Lol what? The i3 won't bottleneck an R9 380.Suck it up and reorganise after a clean install. Sorry :P You can't. Visit a computer store and ask if they'll let you bring your PC in and use a CPU they have to update your BIOS, or ask a friend, or buy a compatible CPU and return it after the update. Okay so they're quad cores with no hyperthreading, basically old i5s. They'll do good in all but the most CPU intensive games. I'd wait for the 380X if you're not in a hurry, it should be coming out this month. (November)


Whatever you do, do not get a TN monitor, for the love of god. 144hz, 1440p **IPS** monitor all the way. IPS looks so much better than TN. 


Let me put a build together for you. IPS really just looks better in every single way, I had a TN monitor for my whole life and then I got a laptop with an IPS screen, and it's beautiful. Colors look much better, viewing angles are huuuuuuuugely better and... Well yeah that's it but it really is a huge improvement in image quality. Well, the thing is, it's not a 3K build. It's a 2K build and a $700 monitor :P 

Here's my build, I know money saving isn't an issue but I went with some more cost efficient options rather than "SPEND 3K BECAUSE YOU CAN!"

-Changed the CPU cooler to a H105, it's more than enough cooling unless you're going for a stupidly high overclock. Skylake doesn't output as much heat as previous generations. 

-Stepped the motherboard down a notch, it's not missing any serious features and Gigabyte makes high quality boards, especially at this price range. 

-Cheaper and equally as fast RAM. 

-500GB 850 Evo, don't buy the 840s, they're outdated and they have a hardware problem. 

-Switched the GPU to the Gigabyte G1 Gaming 980Ti, afaik it's the coolest and quietest 980Ti around, the cooler is seriously good. I've used one first hand and even overclocked it maxed out around 70C. 

-Switched the powersupply to an arguably "worse" unit, only because it's 80+ Gold, but I'd rather get this than overspend on the HX750i, unless you *really* want the Corsair Link functionality, the EVGA 850 G2 is a better option. It's cheaper, more wattage, has longer warranty and is from a better brand. With 850W you'll be able to add another 980Ti and run SLI in the future. 

-Switched the monitor to a G-sync 144hz 1440p IPS monitor, which is awesome. 


The case is umm, well it's okay but I'd personally go for something more stylish / higher quality like the Phanteks Enthoo Luxe or the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX, especially the Evolv is really high quality. Full, thick aluminium build, beautiful. Watch hardwarecanucks' reviews of both those cases if you want. 


Edit: Switched to an 850W PSU to open the future SLI window. Exactly these, or similar parts. Keep an eye on /r/buildapcsales too and feel free to PM me or reply to this comment when you find a discount on something, I can tell you if it's any good :) 

You're welcome Damn that's a good chip, why don't you try to get it as high as possible with 1.35V? You might be able to do 5Ghz!Wiggle Wiggle Wow. If OP doesn't pick this deal up I'll tear my hair out and shoot myself in the dick. 190 bucks for a 5930K, holy shit.. Buy the 5930K from your friend and sell it on /r/hardwareswap for double the price. dude 1.35V isn't crazy at all, I'd run 1.35V 24/7 if my temps weren't as high as they are, so I'll probably delid tomorrow and go for whatever clock I can get at whatever voltage, as long as I can keep it under 80 degrees I'm good :)What website is this? http://imgur.com/ozliHAg


Much cheaper and will be more than good enough for the light stuff you mentioned :) EVGA NEX series has really bad voltage stability and it's loud under load, go with the GS or G2 series. Afaik, no. I used alternate.be I think? Unless it automatically switched me to NL since I live there.. Anyway, just get whatever cheap 1x8GB stick you can find. AMD vs Intel doesnt really matter in these type of computers, they will both perform good enough for light usage, only in higher end computers Intel wins You're welcome :DDon't get that Corsair PSU, get something by Seasonic, Superflower, XFX, or EVGA. It's not bad but you can get higher quality units by the companies I mentioned above for less or just as much money. The only thing that you shouldn't get from EVGA is their NEX series and their bottom of the barrel 400W unit. Excellent. All Seasonic powersupplies are great quality, and I think most of them have 5 or more years of warranty. The one you chose has 5 years. And 7970, both can be found for around 150 dollars and they're kick ass cards. I think it's equal/a little bit slower. I'm not sure. A 7970 is equal to the 280X, I'm sure you can find a comparison. Beautiful. Congratulations. :) You can buy custom backplates for your GPUs, that'd look pretty sexy. Definitely if you get Skylake, the Skylake integrated graphics are actually pretty powerful, really really close to the integrated graphics of the A10 7850K, but with much stronger CPU cores. Look at the i3 6100 and a DDR3 supporting motherboard, and keep in mind that integrated graphics highly depend on RAM speed, so get 2133mhz RAM. Hot in Sweden? Hahaha, nah, nah.. No it isn't. Aww.. Just make sure you always let her know that it's just a game and that she can't take anything that happens inside of games too seriously, and that it doesn't affect real life in any way at all. It doesn't really matter much afaik, should be fine. Dude, that's only the case on mobile operating systems like iOS and Android, not on Windows and not on OSX either afaik. Don't get SP fans, SP stands for Static Pressure. You want AF fans, AF stands for Air Flow. ...budget?R9 390, but for that resolution both are overkill indeed. You may want to upgrade to a 1080p monitor in the future though, so getting the R9 390 isn't a bad idea. Both GPUs are pretty equally matched, but the i3 is much better for gaming. Pictures? Exact pcpartpicker list? Did you test your PSU if it works at all? 

Take a paperclip and connect the green wire with any black wire on your PSUs 24 pin cable. Make sure the PSU is unplugged and nothing else is plugged in when you connect the paperclip and then plug your PSU in, if its fan spins it works. What the heck do you need 8 monitors for? i3No, and no, PCI E 2.0 won't bottleneck your card, maybe like 2% or something. R9 390, it won't max it out but pretty close. Maxed out would be 40+ FPS, not constant 60.Wait... Wrong post :lPowersupply availability in the Netherlands sucks major dick but get an 850W or more unit from Seasonic, XFX, Superflower, EVGA or CoolerMaster's V series (and only the V series). RAM will fit and perform the same as any other RAM, no worries. Nope, DDR3 boards and RAM are cheaper so that would better fit the budget. Hmm, I didn't think the price difference was so small. I did say get fast RAM though so either way the iGPU wouldn't bottleneck. Check, check and check. All correct. 

Literally the only fucking thing that matters is the generation, DDR2, 3, 4, whateverthefuck.)No. Get 1x4 now and then you'll have space to add another 1.4 later and you'll have 8. That's a lot more annoying to do if you already filled both slots. If you can afford it, sure, but at that point you're better off buying 1x8 again for easy upgradeability to 2x8 in the future. Larger sticks are also much easier to sell if you end up doing that for whatever reason. There's no real benefit of going dual channel, there's maybe a 5% performance increase at most but I've seen 2-3% being said a lot. Cable management is actually a lot easier with a PSU cover Yes, and just buy any red fan you like I guess. Beautiful. I might be jealous. Awesome build, we need more pictures though. Who cares about warranty with RAM? It never dies :pAre you sure you need the Windows licence and a new hard drive? Do you not have an old computer to pull the Windows licence off and use the hard drive?

Is what you can get if you skip the Windows licence, the SSD will make it FAST. Not that it matters for his dad's usage, and the A6 has stronger integrated graphics. Yes, but as secondary drive with an SSD as main it's perfect. He can transfer the Windows licence to the SSD and wipe the HDD. You can pull the Windows licence off the laptop, I think if you right click Computer and to to Properties it'll show you the Windows key. You can use it to activate Windows that you install on the SSD, and you could wipe the laptop's HDD and use it as a secondary drive. Well, I just right clicked This PC on my laptop and went to Properties, and it shows the key, so umm... I'm pretty sure OP can reactivate that key, phone activation almost always works. That really won't be the case, both CPUs will be easily strong enough for whatever OPs dad will do with his computer and he won't notice any performance increase by going with a stronger CPU.. Just go for the cheapest option. What a terrible thing to happen Dude, overclock your CPU! It's so old, it really needs a boost. Is Windows power plan set to balanced? Is your GPU power plugged I? Is your monitor plugged into your GPU or motherboard? Balanced*

High performance locks the CPU to max frequency, it's unnecessary heat and noise :/3 doesn't matter at all, just saying :PI'm pretty sure the sticks will match each other, but I'm not 100% sure. Fair enough Witcher 3 is one of those games that literally doesn't care about CPU power at all from benchmarks I've seen. Get a Corsair H75 or better. Get a Supernova G2 PSU instead and look into Phanteks cases. They're much higher quality. Yeah, switch to an i5 and get a cheaper motherboard. Motherboards really don't make a difference to performance at all, just don't get a garbage one and you're good. 


What website are you ordering from? The parts on pcpartpicker likely won't be in stock at your local store. So what part list did you end up with now from local shops? 

Kingston pulled a nasty bait switch on their SSDNow V300, they sent out really fast versions to reviewers, and when the good reviews came out they switched them to very slow models. It was a very cheap and unfair tactic and Kingston SSDs need to be banned for a long time so they know that shit like this isn't acceptable. Really? Corsair CX powersupply in a 1400 dollar build? No, get a Seasonic, XFX, Superflower Leadex or EVGA powersupply. 

Edit: Not an EVGA NEX PSU though, the NEX series is bad. It will fit, but if you go for a Mini ITX board you should also get a much smaller case, to save space. Display port ports? Because the gsync module costs fucking 200 dollars and drives the price up for no reason at all. NVIDIA are money hungry hounds. The 6600K is much better for gaming than the Xeon will ever even dream to be. You'd only want the Xeon if you were video editing, rendering, etc. Multithreaded stuff.What kind of water spill? A glass of water or was the computer submerged? Was it on when it happened? I bet the CPU is still fine, and the PSU might be too if no water got into it.. He was asking for watercooling specifically but yes the 212 Evo is better, I know. Air cooling superiority for all but looks :pUmm... What? No, no that's not how this works at all, a company isn't going to eat losses because nvidia is being a bitch about their stupid little gsync chip and all the cost associated with it. Nvidia are the cheap ones here. Asus definitely has the easiest BIOS and good boards so I'll second the Z170-AThe temps on that Hybrid are weird, shouldn't be that high, I think the pump may be broken. CPU temps on the other hand are completely fine and you have headroom for overclocking, but they're not outstanding, did you apply the cooler in one go or did you put it on, take it off, and put it on again? 


How are you liking that monitor? I want one! Full specs of your old computer would be helpful. Damn, you're an unlucky man.. I hope you weren't unlucky with your X34, Acer is recalling a ton of them I heard... 

Your GPU should be around 50 degrees max, can you feel the pump vibrating slightly? Anything up to like 75 degrees is fine for your CPU, 85 in stress tests is fine too because it won't actually get that hot in real usage. Your airflow reverse idea is good. You're welcome :) 

Crucial and Adata both sell very well priced SSDs if you want to save a bit over the Samsung 850 Evo. I've had good experiences with my own Crucial SSDs and Crucial's customer service. Random people on the internet are calling LeafyIsHere dad on every single one of his youtube videos, so you calling your mother's boyfriend which you're very close with dad isn't even anywhere remotely close to inappropriate. Go for it :) I can't find that PSU for 72 NZD, not even close... 


http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/part/antec-power-supply-vp700p

115 dollars.. My build is currently garbage because it's in a temporary case, without a powersupply (RMAing that), but you can easily find pictures of computers around here :P

Yes, all XFX PSUs are made by Seasonic, and all Seasonic PSUs are good. 

Corsair CX are overpriced and low quality. Well... Sorry to break it to you, but working pumps vibrate.. Damnit EVGA! I'd call them up and say that this is your third replacement, and that you'd appreciate your next one being tested before they send it out to you. Or something. Good luck. What CPU do you have exactly? The Fry's guy doesn't know what he's talking about, you can upgrade to whatever GPU you want as long as your powersupply can handle it, but your CPU upgrade will be limited or impossible depending on what motherboard you have. It's called a motherboard, no idea what makes your friend think it's called a microboard. It's not. Hmm... So maybe the pump is working.. Either way, your Hybrid shouldn't be running that hot. Not that 70C is hot, but those cards generally sit in the high 40s or low 50s under load. OP plsBad idea. Motherboards with issues from the gate usually develop more issues over time, and unless you bought it second hand, you have two years of warranty. Not one. 


Suck it up and RMA the board, better safe than sorry :) Nice. We demand pictures! Absolutely worth it on the SSD and overclocking part. PM me if you want me to help you overclock, I also have an Asus board and I've overclocked my i5 2500K and i7 3770K for the past 4 years. My 2500K has been places, seen things, it's been to space and back. 5Ghz baby. It's really easy to get your 2600K to a nice speed, completely safe. It'll work, yes you need thermal paste. The Thermaltake Smart PSUs are garbage, do not buy. Get a cheaper motherboard maybe. The PSU is so cheap becasue it's a piece of shit, buy something else. Seasonic, XFX, Superflower Leadex, EVGA (all EVGA except the NEX series) and CoolerMaster's V series (and V series only) are all great powersupplies.. GS* :PNZXT and Fractal Design have good cheap stuff. Pcpartpicker list please. If you want us to help, don't be lazy and include one :) Are you okay with buying second hand? You can get significantly more performance if you buy second hand. Dude, your PSU probably also doesn't support your new GPU.. Unless you've upgraded it. 

Edit: nvm, just looked your computer up, it's not upgradable at all. Don't bother. Return the GPU you bought, you have to buy a whole new computer as far as I can tell. Don't buy hard drives second hand (certain SSDs are okay, avoid Kingston, Crucial M4s and Samsung 840s), avoid graphics cards with only one fan (the fans are things on GPUs that die not the actual GPU itself.), the rest is okay. 


Processors live forever, so does RAM, motherboards live pretty long too but you're not buying anything ancient so you're fine, check /r/hardwareswap for some good deals, /r/buildapcsales is great too. Oh god. We meet again. You have a nearly 5 year old Corsair CX unit? Oh boy, I'm surprised it hasn't died yet. Yes, replace it. Alright, you're currently ~350 dollars under budget, I'd highly recommend getting a nice and large SSD if you want an overall fast computer, SSDs are sooooooooooooooooooo much faster and more responsive than HDDs it's actually insane, you absolutely won't regret blowing so much money on a 500GB or even a 1TB SSD. You could get an R9 280X or a regular 380, the 380X won't be *that much* better, and it'll probably be much more expensive. 

Could you tell me what exactly this computer will be used for? What is work? Unless you're actually using heavily multithreaded apps, you won't benefit from an i7 (let alone a 6 core i7) if you don't actually have a way to use all those cores. Your comment doesn't make much sense, he doesn't need anywhere close to 850W and the 380X isn't meant to compete with the 970.Could you monitor your CPU usage during those tasks? Because I bet you're not using all 4 cores with only chrome, regardless of how many tabs you have open. You'd be better off investing in a large SSD off the bat, because transferring your OS and shit from one drive to another is a royal pain in the fucking ass, really. Start with a 250-500GB SSD and a 1 or 2TB secondary drive for mass storage, it's absolutely worth it. Sounds like a RAM shortage more than anything, and you may want to look into The Great Suspender if you have good Internet, it's a chrome extension that suspends (pauses) inactive tabs. Definitely let me know what overclock you end up with! What cooler do you have? 

Stay under 1.350V for daily usage and you're all good. Use High or Normal LLC, higher than that and it goes ballistic. It's meant for incredibly high voltages. It's necessary Are you trolling or is this a legit request for help? Because this umm..... This build is just bad, I'm sorry Umm, unless you have a Z170 board, nope. I ummmmmm.....

.......... :/

Build looks good though. That doesn't sound too good. Invest in a Hyper 212 Evo, it's a really great cooler and it'll handle whatever overclock you throw at your CPU no problem.

How's that? This build will even let you re-use your RAM because the motherboard supports DDR3 :D 

Saving money, woohoo! They will work just fine but the Z chipset is more expensive and meant for overclocking, while the i5 6400 can't overclock, so you pretty much wasted money on an expensive and high quality Z170 board while a B150 or H170 board would've been just as good. 

I'm personally a huge fan of overclocking and I'd day it's worth it to get a 6600K instead, but it's up to you, you'll also have to buy a CPU cooler if you go that route. Of course, we all have to start somewhere. Let me pull it up here and break it down;

The FX AMD series are very weak to begin with, even the "8 core" FX-8350 gets beat by an Intel i5, and when it comes to gaming, even an i3 will perform better because games favor high performance *per core*, which Intel has going for them. If you're a video editor on a budget the FX 8350 is a good choice, it is cheaper than an i5 and will perform better in multithreaded workloads, but it lacks behind by a mile in single core performance. You can see benchmarks [here](http://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_core_i5_4690k-412-vs-amd_fx_8350-7). 


On top of that, the FX 4350 isn't a True "quad core", it's something similar to the Intel i3s, which have 2 cores and hyperthreading. Obviously AMD isn't allowed to use this technology, but in practice, it's similar. The 8350 also isn't a True 8 core, apparently, AMD got sued for that recently, but that's beside the point. 

&amp;nbsp;


The motherboard is just ridiculous here, look at the price, it's double the price of the processor. It should be slightly over half the price of the processor to make any sort of sense. It's a great motherboard, Asus Sabertooth boards are built to last and they come with a certificate thingy that they're basically rugged as fuck. 

&amp;nbsp;

RAM and HDD are good, nothing to say. 

&amp;nbsp;

Asus makes really bad AMD cards, I tend to stay away from them, but I'm not sure about this specific model. 

&amp;nbsp;

Corsair PSUs are generally overpriced, but on top of that, their lower end CX/VS/CS series are pretty shitty. The VS series should never be touched at all, not even with a long stick, the CX series can be used with caution in not-very-intensive systems, and the CS series are pretty good but still overpriced. The HX/HXi/AXi/AX/RMi/RMx are very very good, but also overpriced, don't buy unless you find a good deal, and the RM ones are average. You're gonna want to stick with Seasonic, XFX, Superflower and EVGA for PSUs. Just stay away from the EVGA NEX series. 

&amp;nbsp;

And finally, the peripherals, spending over 100 dollars on peripherals while there's a decent mouse/keyboard combo for only 30 dollars is silly on a budget like this. He could save so much money here and buy significantly better parts, and just upgrade his peripherals later. 


Hmm, alright, fair enough. As I said, build looks good, and it's by the rules don't worry :) 

By the time you have to upgrade the 6400 the 6600K won't be a worthy upgrade because by that time there will be a new motherboard socket and several new generations of CPUs. Chrome is a broken piece of shit. Close it and re-open once a day to clear all memory leaks and garbage alike. No, not really.. Not yet anyway, but the 6600K has the potential to be **2Ghz** faster than the 6400, my friend is running his 6600K at 4.7Ghz with a Hyper 212 Evo, and the 6400 speed is only 2.7Ghz5% performance increase from overclocking? Lol what? The 6400 speed is 2.7Ghz, the 6600K stock speed is 3.5Ghz, without overclocking that's already 800Mhz faster. When you overclock the 6600K the gap becomes ridiculous. The 6600K can be over 2Ghz faster than the 6400, that's like an 80% performance increase. Because Single more powerful GPU &gt; dual weaker GPU Oh, I thought he got the 6400 for some reason. My bad. 

It's 3.2Ghz still though, so if you overclock your 6600K to 4.7Ghz it's still a 1.5Ghz increase over the 6600. Turbo isn't the same as overclocking, you need to read up on how turbo boost works. He's very pleased with is, it's awesome, and the 212 Evo does an excellent job. I think he runs it at 1.36V or something and his temps always stay under 75 degrees. /u/Maleton3 come confirm. That means one or both of the other DIMM slots are broken. Which means your Mobo has an issue. Are you seriously in denial about this? My friend has a 6600K with a 212, it's certainly doable. 

Turbo boost doesn't apply to all cores, only one core will reach the max turbo boost, the more cores active the lower the speed. Overclocking is by all cores. Fluid? What. Yup it's good. You can do 4.5 or higher too with that cooler. You shouldn't be scared of clock speeds, you should be scared of voltage. Speed doesn't kill, voltage does, what's your voltage at for 4.2ghz?Very interesting... I was under the impression that the heatpipes were solid copper, thanks for the clarification. If you delid it, use CLLU between the die and the heatspreader, put regular thermal paste between the heatspreader and your cooler. 


*Cooler


*Thermal paste 


*Heatspreader 


*CLLU


*CPU die

Like that Ah. Well, you can probably do 4.4Ghz at least with very very safe voltage. By that point the next gen CPUs will be out already What CPU cooler are you getting? Yes, I forgot you were getting that. Why that and not the Hyper 212 Evo? It's newer. I love small builds, good job. &gt;Get a better PSU (seasonic or evga, basically)

Add XFX and Superflower, and mention that one should avoid EVGA's NEX series, and you're good. I think the Evo is about the same price. Also check out the Cryorig H7 and H5, they look a lot better and perform the same/better than the Hyper 212 + or Evo. It looks like you'll be able to play Fallout 4 nearly maxed out at 1080p with a 280X actually but it's also pretty CPU dependant I'm guessing. If you can pick up a second hand 280X or 7970 for under 150 dollars then you should definitely upgrade to an i3, it's a huge improvement over the pentium :) Basically [these](http://myfilehost.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/9/3/12937251/5719671_orig.png) are the two types of GPU coolers (excluding watercooling). The one on the left is called a blower style cooler, AMD and NVIDIA puts these piece of shit coolers on their reference design cards, avoid them at all cost. They are loud, terrible at cooling and die much quicker. The one on the right is an open style cooler, they're custom designed by companies like MSI, EVGA, Gigabyte, Sapphire, etc. and they're much quieter, some of them practically inaudible, and they're often amazing at cooling. That of course depends on the brand, so always read reviews. 


People start considering aftermarket CPU coolers, or full on custom watercooling loops in their systems when they have the **NEED FOR SPEED**, GOTTA GO FAST, MORE POWERRRRRRR!!... In other words, when they want to take overclocking to the extreme. For a CPU your gonna need something better than the stock cooler for pretty much any overclock, the CoolerMaster Hyper 212 Evo is hugely popular for its incredible cooling performance at a low price. 


If you have any more questions feel free to ask, you can even message me on Telegram to chat about this stuff, I enjoy talking about it and explaining things. My name on Telegram is the same as it is on reddit. I'm not a huge fan of watercooling, it's great for aesthetics but other than that it's not hugely special to be honest. If looks aren't so important to you, get the Noctua NH-D15 or NH-D14 if you have low profile RAM, those coolers perform the same as the Corsair H100i and they are significantly cheaper, more reliable, quieter but also a lot uglier :P For aesthetics you can get a Corsair H75 or something :) Nah these things happen a lot, bend the fins back if you can and go on with your day.

The CPU is only 100 mhz slower which doesn't really make any difference at all, cheaper motherboard, no cooler because the stock one is enough, cheaper SSD, cheaper case and cheaper+better PSU, cheaper wifi adapter, better GPU for 1440p gaming and a much better single monitor, you can always add a second monitor later, get one cheap from a friend, yard sale, relative, whatever. A single way better monitor is the best choice, everything will look so much better on this one. 


IPS looks WAY better than TN, and 1440p looks WAY better than 1080p, combine the two and you get a monitor that blows the 1080p TN monitors you selected out of the water. If you want, sure, but you can re-use a smaller case too. Unless you're gonna go crazy with multiple GPUs this will be fine. Yeah just leave it then :) Upgrade to Windows 10 you won't regret it. Your CPU is strong enough, and your motherboard can hold a new GPU no problem, it's the powersupply I'm worried about. Could you either give me an exact model number of your powersupply or take a picture of it, upload it to imgur, and post the link here so I can take a look. Neither. Get a cheaper motherboard and upgrade something more important like your SSD or something. The i3 is pretty powerful, maybe look for a second hand i5 at /r/hardwareswapuk, processors live forever, don't worry about buying one second hand. http://thomascomputerrepair.com/images/xps_inside_label.jpg

That should give you a good idea of what to do. Take the side panel off your computer and take a picture of the powersupply, make sure the text on it is clearly readable. It's likely a piece of shit and you will need to upgrade it if it is a piece of shit. 

Edit: Upload two pictures while your at it, one of the whole inside of your computer and one of only the powersupply, focused pictures please :) Alright, sadly, you don't have enough power for anything better than a 750Ti, which isn't very powerful at all. Where do you live? Germany? I'll find you a good powersupply that'll last for like 10 years. You said 3-400 euro budget right? (the powersupply will be under 100, likely less, haven't checked German prices.)Oh jeez NZ prices are bad... Whew... Nevermind :/

The Gigabyte one would be good too though. Alright, I have a few options here for you. Two of which are under 100 euros. Do you know what the 80+ ratings are/mean, and do you know what modularity is? Please watch these two videos and then get back to me :)

They're all very high quality, don't worry about that, but it's about what features you want. Something like an R9 380 would suit your needs pretty well I think You're very welcome. Feel free to contact me when you get your new components and I'll guide you through installing them step by step, and make sure you buy the 4GB version of the 380. Quit what team? There's no team. Now. 


/u/saltymuffaca, listen, you're in a bad relationship. Break up with her. The difference is about 100 dollars, and I'd say it's definitely worth it to people that don't have a tight budget. Why do you want one? And you can probably just downclock and undervolt a regular 6700 to simulate the T version. You can just stay with the 970 if you want, there's not a huge difference between it and the 390, but if you want to spend the time and effort in to swapping them out then by all means, go ahead. Looks awesome, but come on man... Tidy those cables up, it just ruins everything :(


(including airflow) You know the 6700T is also slower than the 6700 right? If this is a workstation you should probably care about speed as well. The regular 6700 is still very easy to cool. 40 watts of difference isn't going to be noticeable at all especially on a rig that's only gonna be on 10 hours a day. Just tie the cables down out of sight it really isn't rocket science it just takes some patience and careful looking. Then you're extremely lazy. It's so simple. Just look at the cables, look at where they need to go and then look around your case for the best route for that cable. It just takes some patience and planning, it's not hard at all which is why there are no tutorials. Trial and error. /r/cablemanagementYes. No, the 6700K is better for *gaming*. The powersupply is okay, Dell has a lot of experience in the server market so they know a thing or two about how to make a reliable system. That said, it's not the best and I wouldn't keep it for too long. You could run a GTX 950 / 960 or an R9 380 on that powersupply but I wouldn't run anything more powerful than that. Maybe the 380 is already pushing it. .... No, the 6700K is better for gaming than the 5960X This is beautiful IPS* 

Do you want freesync or gsync? You need more than 8GB of RAM, 8 absolutely won't do it if you want to have so many things open at the same time. Get an EVGA 500B powersupply instead of the CX. Since price isn't an issue, have you considered the Acer Predator X34? A new batch will go up for sale December 12th iirc. That monitor is pretty much perfect, I wish I could have it every day. Lol. Upload a picture of the side of your PSU. We have to know exactly what it is. The chance is high that it'll work fine That's a very shitty PSU but it will work. That board only has 3 power phases as far as I can tell, absolutely horrible for overclocking, get something else. The more the better. This board has 10 power phases, and fits the color scheme, kinda, it's light gray I think that mixes pretty well, and this cooler is way better. Slightly outperforms the Hyper 212 Evo and it looks beautiful.

A small air cooler isn't going to be good enough no matter how much he wants it to be. If he wants it to be small and elegant he has to stretch his budget and get a liquid cooler, but at that point it'd be better to just get a second hand unlocked Intel motherboard/CPU/cooler combo from someone that's upgrading. That's a good cooler. Want me to help you overclock your CPU to 4.5Ghz safely? It's very simple. I've had my i5 2500K at 4.7Ghz for 4 years. Send me a message on Telegram and I'll help you, my name there is the same as it is on here. reddit...I also type with my index fingers but I don't need to look at the keyboard.. I type pretty fast and accurately as well.OAll the food we produce goes to the animals we end up eating. It costs **tons** more veggies to feed the animal to adulthood/ready for slaughter than the amount of meat we get from that animal. World hunger would be gone completely if we all went vegan.It's pretty much impossible to move the CPU while the retention arm is holding it in place, so no problem. Step down, to a 650 or even 550W PSU and get faster RAM, that'll actually help performance quite a bit in Fallout 4 and probably more games that I don't know about. Less. There's only like 5 dollars of difference between slow and fast RAM there's really no point in buying 1333mhz anymore. 1866 should be the minimum. What does Automod PM you when a post needs to be approved? And why would a PSA like this be disapproved by Automod? (Just curious)Just avoid Corsair's VS, CX and CS series. Seasonic, Superflower, EVGA, XFX and Enermax are all good indeed. Corsair? No. Only their high end stuff. Cougar has some better powersupplies than Corsair's VS/CX/CS units. Especially the VS ones are fucking terrible and the CX ones are barely acceptable. They're all bad. Only their high end stuff is good. Ah okay. Makes sense. The powersupply is important. If you get a low power GPU and a small PSU you won't be able to upgrade to a power hungry GPU in the future because your PSU won't be able to handle it. Get a high quality PSU with at least 550W from the start and you'll be able to keep it for many many years. 550W is enough to power almost anything right now (single GPU setups) but 650W would be a safer bet.  Yeah and look where Corsair's VS, CX and CS series are on that list. You're only proving my point. Your GPU should already be very capable for 1080p but I guess you could pick up an [R9 390](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B00YXSL4Z0/ref=mp_s_a_1_40?qid=1449063673&amp;sr=8-40&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165&amp;keywords=r9+390) for \u00a3220, that'd do even better and max just about everything out at 1080p.

Yup and they will be for quite a while still. [Processors evolve very slowly.](http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/422/Intel_Core_i5_i5-3470_vs_Intel_Core_i5_i5-6500.html)&gt;as every brand has good PSU's and terrible ones.

Exactly. There's no such thing as a perfect brand... Well, I guess there's Seasonic but they are the only ones and a company that awesome is rare. They check all boxes, quality products, quality customer support, no bullshit marketing.. We need more companies like Seasonic. I would take your sweet time and watch /r/buildapcsales like a fucking hawk. Buy everything with a big discount in pairs and you'll save a lot of money. I know about Superflower but I don't know enough about them to make such a statement. Their Leadex platform is incredible and is destroying everything else at the moment but idk about their cheaper offerings. Educate me. &gt;Super Flower simply doesn't sell garbage under their name - you only have 3 or 4 families of PSUs and all of them can be safely put into your PC. Sometimes they won't be the best thing on Earth (I mean, can't expect miracles from 80Plus Bronze PSU for 50\u20ac) but you don't risk anything by going with them.

Seasonic is exactly like this as well. Nice. Added Superflower to my perfect company list. How's their customer support? I already liked Superflower but I like them even more now. Why not? You should be able to do at least 4.5Ghz with that cooler which is a significant performance boost. You're just upset because I'm right. Add me on Telegram (same name as reddit) or Skype (dax.nagtegaal) and I'll help you overclock it step by step. &gt;Look, all the PSU's I listed have Tier 1 PSU rankings

No they don't. Corsair's VS and CX units are tier **4** and CS series is tier **3**, not even close to good units. Then don't list Corsair as a whole, that's misleading information. Why are you so mad and why are you insulting me? I can't believe how mad you are for being wrong, wow dude.. If you're over 18 you need therapy to deal with this immature behavior, learn how to have a civil discussion and how to deal with being wrong, jeez.. I know Corsair sells great powersupplies, but if you'd properly read what I've been saying you'd understand that I'm only talking about their VS/CX/CS series specifically and because those are bad you can't name Corsair as a whole as a good PSU brand because that is False information and it will lead newcomers into buying their low end units because they're cheap and someone said Corsair's PSUs are good. That's not cool. Either be more specific or leave Corsair out completely. Get the 970.Could've been a little nicer about it, but yeah, you're right. Like it's a bad thing to have a slightly overkill PSU, unless it's a low quality one.. How did that even happen... That must've been a serious spill... Whole glass? That 2600K is still good for gaming especially when overclocked, and you can always sell it for some extra budget... Or give it to me :D

Considered a dual Xeon build?/r/suggestalaptopWindows 10 supports DX12 and games will generally be more optimised for it in the future I guess, you're gonna have to get used to it. http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-fatal1tyz97killer



Get that board, it has awesome power delivery compared to other boards that price (assuming you're okay with mail in rebates). No they do not come with WiFi you have to buy a WiFi card.

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-z97gaming5#viewImages



http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97xgaming5#viewImagesIf you have a bit to spare, get a better powersupply. It's a long time investment but a good one can easily last 10 years. I'll edit in a link to the best and cheapest one I can find. 


Edit: [7 years of warranty, extremely quiet fan, looks great, is fully modular, is 80+ Gold](http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/463792/corsair-rm650x.html) and it's really not that expensive at \u20ac110 considering how long you'll keep it. It'll power this build, your next build and probably the build after that. There's only a 20-30 euro difference between the two, and Corsair's RMx units are incredible. The 1000W version scored a perfect 10/10 from jonnyguru. The longevity and reliability is definitely worth it in my opinion anyway, and over the course of 10 years (the time you'll keep it) the efficiency will more than make up for the difference in price. If people meat was sold in supermarkets and served in restaurants I'd also eat it just the same as any other meat. No difference. Why?

12 cores, 24 threads, well within budget. Reliable components, ECC memory, 7 year warranty on the powersupply, silent case with good airflow and all that good stuff. ok. Maybe you can, but what about the maintenance? Every PC you add hugely increases the chance of hardware failure and software error. It'd also probably cost a lot more electricity, and take way more space, generally I don't think it's a great idea. You could make just two 1000 euro builds and link those, if a component in one fails you can fall back on the other one, but more than two systems would be silly in my opinion. Better to have one or two very high quality and reliable systems than many cheap and possibly unreliable systems. The H60 just straight up isn't good enough. It's a very thin single 120mm radiator. Performs worse than the Hyper 212 Evo, that cheap ass air cooler. I also have a H60 and while it looks good it just doesn't perform well at all. I guess Windows 10 is using your CPU more effectively, 67 degrees is totally fine. Is your CPU overclocked? Definitely get a new powersupply and GPU, your CPU is still good, just overclock it for extra performance until you run into CPU bottlenecks. Link the actual pre-built.

The powersupply is probably garbage and it'll come with a very short warranty. Building is better. Oh you upgraded to 8.1 not 10, oops.. Yeah there was a significant performance increase from 7 to 8.1 and a small one from 8.1 to 10. What mess with NVIDIA? Windows 10 is working wonderfully for my friend and his 970.A Titan X will *work* but it'll be bottlenecked to absolute **shit** by that CPU. And you have the powersupply to keep in mind as well. I'd probably throw in a 750Ti and call it a day, it uses a very small amount of power and it's pretty fast. Can play any current game at good framerates at 1080p if you dial the settings back. Looks good, other than the powersupply. EVGA fucked up on the NEX series, those have very bad voltage stability on the 12V rail. Go for the GS or G2 series, anything by Seasonic, Superflower, XFX, or Corsair's high end stuff (not VS/CX/CS). CoolerMaster's V series is great too. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=14-131-673


160 bucks for the R9 380 here. Just ignore itThis computer won't use more than 500W, likely less. You're getting a locked CPU, so drop the cooler and drop the Z170 board to a cheaper H170 one since you won't be overclocking. 



A good quality powersupply has no trouble running at 100% load, even peaking over (drawing 800W from a 750w PSU) for a few seconds during power spikes is no problem, but you have to have a proper quality powersupply.

How's this? Higher quality powersupply included. An overclocked R9 390 and 4690K may pull close to that but I think it will be fine. The RM series is pretty good but the other units I mentioned are better. The RMx and RMi series are way better than the regular RM units as well. That's a great board. Awesome. Enjoy your 10 years of warranty. 


(Or it might be 7, I'm not sure.. Awesome unit either way) Looks good. No overkill, and high quality stuff. Looks pretty good but since you'll be overclocking, get a motherboard with better power delivery. Your current selection only has 4 power phases (see the squares next to and above the CPU socket), you want to go for at least 6.

Get faster RAM, the price increase is so small for 1866mhz RAM. Other than that you're all good. You have more than enough wattage on your PSU to do whatever you want in the future, and it's a high quality unit. Just sort from price low to high and check each one of them, you can visually see the power phases on the pictures. Thank you, but I think you made the wiser choice. I have a 2500K to fall back on, so I was sort of indifferent about it. It was surprisingly simple and if I wasn't so shaky it would've been flawless, I normally have a very steady hand but jesus christ I couldn't control myself. I almost pussied out but I already cut one of the corners, so I convinced myself there's no going back. Your 3570K isn't doing too bad, it looks like my 3770K just straight up doesn't want to go over 4.5Ghz but I'll do more experimenting tomorrow.. I'm sure it won't go much further though. No it's not there but I used the well known razorblade method, easily found on YouTube and the rest of the internet. I was extremely nervous about doing this so for weeks, so I decided to just do it when I has 2 free hours. I didn't think about recording it or whatever becasue I was too shaky anyway. 


Edit: misread your question I think. The steps after I got it open are there in the imgur link, and also easily found on YouTube and such. Yes, /u/dumplestilskin and /u/kurk231 got it right, it's CoolLaboratory Liquid Ultra. It's a liquid metal, which is extremely thermally but also electrically conductive. You have to be very careful and apply a tiny tiny layer (you're supposed to spread this stuff out) so that it won't spill. I have it on my GPU and CPU die, and also on my CPU's heatspreader. It performs better than all other pastes but it's harder to clean and it's risky if you're not careful because it's conductive. It's still risky. If you fuck up, you're fucked. Did you put an extremely thin layer? A very small amount of this stuff can be spread out over quite a large surface. I always squeeze a tiny bit, less than I'll probably need out of the tube and start spreading it, if it's not enough you can just add a tiny bit more to your brush. 


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;at least one 4690k

You rich? Yeah the procedure isn't difficult to do at all, but one tiny mistake and you've killed your CPU, it's definitely risky. Feel free to ask me whatever about it, this was my first encounter with the stuff and it's kind of a bizarre substance. It's very easy to work with though. &gt; is spreadable metal? 

It's quite literally a liquid form of metal, like Mercury, except it's not dangerous. 



&gt;How do you keep air bubbles out? 

Don't know, you don't need to worry about that though. This stuff isn't the same as normal thermal paste. 



&gt;Does it cure differently over time? 


I'm not sure yet, I don't think it has cure time.. 


&gt;How do you remove it?


Just like any other thermal paste, with patience and alcohol. 





&gt;For TIM, I usually do the pea method where you just screw the cooler onto the bracket and it spreads the paste out.

Yup, that's the correct way for regular paste, but this stuff comes with a little brush that you use to spread it out. 



&gt;Would you say it is a significant improvement over arctic silver or other common TIM?


When applied directly to the die, yes, but not when used on top of heatspreaders. Only a few degrees of difference, but it's worth it I think. Also make sure it doesn't touch aluminium because the gallium (I think?) in it will literally destroy the aluminum. Nah, probably not. This should only be done if you have a backup CPU or money to replace it, or if you actually need to. Most of us don't need to, but the way the IHS is applied on some CPUs is just so bad that we can't overclock at all or get insanely high temperatures.There's no price so it's pretty dumb yeah. 

Motherboard isn't that great and the powersupply isn't either, but the rest is good. 

At this price point you're much better off finding a second hand i5 + motherboard combo on /r/hardwareswap and building around that, also second hand. Just get the powersupply and the hard drives new. 

Good but older CPU and Motherboard combos go for around 100-150 dollars all the time and they're great bang for your buck options. Bad deal, no no nope. I assume you're going for reliability, stability and silence here? That's not 2K.


1080p is 2K, 1440p is 2.5K or more commonly known as 1440p or QHDYes it's always worth it. More performance. A CPU is made up of 3 layers in this order. 

Heatspreader (the metal bit that's visible, called the "lid") 

Thermal paste

PCB and CPU die (the actual cores and stuff) 


Delidding is the process of removing the heatspreader (lid) from the CPU to replace the thermal paste with something higher quality, and to get better contact between the die and the heatspreader, which allows for hugely improved cooling capacity. Yeah sell the old kit on /r/hardwareswap. Don't mix and match different sizes and speeds. Shitty reference ones which no one should buy anyway. The GPU in question will fit just fine.Only 14A on the 12V rail I'm not sure if that's enough. Probably not. You should replace that piece of shit powersupply. I read it as 2x4, whoops :P No, no one really goes heatsink directly on die. The point of delidding is to close the tiny gap between the heatspreader and the die, and to replace the shitty thermal paste. You have to remove the bracket/retention arm system around the socket which holds the CPU in place and then mod your cooler to go down just far enough to make proper contact with the die, but not too far because then it'll crush the die. Some companies sell adapters for their coolers to go direct contact with the die but it's generally not worth it. Uhh no that's also shitty, if you upgrade, upgrade to a good powersupply. Something from Seasonic, XFX, Superflower or EVGAIt's really easy. Very very good and that board has an auto overclocking feature. Use it if you're scared to mess up the manual way. Let me know if you want help with overclocking. Stay under 1.4V and under 80 degrees C and you're good. Then how did you reply? Must've been either a terrible brand, or just terrible luck. SSDs live much longer than HDDs generally, and Samsung's Evo drives come with 5 years of warranty. 10 years on the Pro drives. Break their necks. No most of them can't, you have to be insanely lucky in the silicon lottery to get a chip like that. 


As long as you keep your voltage under 1.4 and temperature under 70C your CPU will live a long and happy life. Unfortunate.. Yeah, True, but the higher you go in voltage the faster your chip will degrade,a few months isn't enough, but in a year those chips will have started degrading unless they were kept very cool.. The higher your voltage is the lower your temperatures should be to keep it from degrading. Move your GPU up to the top slot, it's likely not performing 100% in that second slot. Check if your cooler is affected by the Skylake mounting issue. I'm not sure so just a heads up incase you were unaware. 

Great build man, and I feel you on the noise the cooler makes on those cards. I had a 7970 (still have the card) with that blower style reference cooler too, but I pulled it off and replaced it with a cooler that I got second hand from /r/hardwareswap for only $30. Had to buy new thermal pads and an additional fan, total cost was $50 but my GPU now never even touches 80 degrees and it's overclocked to the max. It's also totally inaudible. Something you may want to consider. Yes you'll see a big benefit. I'm also running a 3770K at 4.5Ghz, I can help you overclock it if you want. My system consumes 400W max under full load with a 3770K (obviously) and a 7970, both overclocked to shit. The 7970 is a 250W card and uses around 300W when overclocked, so you can easily run your setup on 850W. The Sapphire is the quietest and best cooler iircYup. You have Skype, Telegram or WhatsApp? WhatsApp would require us to exchange phone numbers, Skype and Telegram don't. Nah man, recent SSDs will last for dozens of years even if you write incredible amounts of data to them. That's not True. Powercolor's PCS+ cards are very good. MSI and Sapphire are better, I agree, but Powercolor isn't *bad* like you say. Ignore him, Powercolor's PCS+ cards are excellent. If you can get Sapphire or MSI for a very small amount more money then yeah go for it, I agree that they're better, but they're not so much better that it's worth spending 20+ more dollars on in my opinion. Awesome! I'd love to see some images of the completed build, that would definitely be awesome. How do you like the monitor? Is it as good as I've read in reviews?Enable XMP in the BIOS and your RAM will run at its rated speed, or you can manually set it. Do you have Skype or Telegram? I can go through some settings with you to make sure all is running as it should.Not sure, but all Seasonic powersupplies are awesome so this is a good thing. Have to know what powersupply you have exactly. "Corsair 600W" isn't specific enough. Upload a picture of it if you have to. Usually the largest cooler. Lol. 


Don't worry too much, go for one from a good brand.  MSI, EVGA Gigabyte and Zotac are all good. I'd personally avoid Asus because of bad experience with their customer service. The **2GB** version shouldn't be SLI'd because it'll just run out of VRAM, so no, not worth it. It's fine, just never do that again. 


Keep in mind that 90 degrees (C) is already enough to hurt you when you touch it, which isn't that hot for a CPU. Damage doesn't occur until like 120 degrees and I doubt it got that hot. No, don't bother. Nah. Hold on. Are you a student maybe? 



Edit: Here's what I'd suggest. The R7 370 is more powerful than the 750Ti, the powersupply in this build is good and reliable, and you get longer warranty on all your parts than you do on the pre-built. If you can get Windows for free from your school because you're a student you can get a way better computer. Or if you have an old computer/laptop to take a Windows licence from that'll achieve the same thing.

What resolution though? A GTX 970 would be enough to run those games on high/ultra at 1080p but for higher you'd want something more powerful. You can always sell the 980Ti when Pascal comes out if you end up getting that. It's infuriating indeed. They don't sell millions of these things, they should check each and every one before shipping them. If I pay that much for a product I'm expecting it to work. You can't upgrade it. Laptops aren't upgradable. Ehh... What? You built your own laptop? I don't believe this to be honest. Interesting. I genuinely didn't even know this was possible so I'm not of any help here unfortunately. I'd seriously ask for the special screw set. If it does turn out to be a problem you're fucked.The 900 series should me more energy efficient than the 800 series, so I doubt heat will be an issue more so than with the 800 series. You could get a 280X (same/better performance) for much less money. They go for around 150 new 120 used. Why does it matter if it was used for mining? Who cares? It doesn't make any difference. Mining cards are arguably more reliable than regular use cards. Miners often undervolt and underclock their cards to keep heat and noise down since they have so many of them, the room they're in would turn into a jet engine powered sauna. And a card running at 100% usage on one steady temperature goes through less abuse than a regular card that constantly goes up and down in temperature which is more damaging than running at full load the whole time. Looks good but get a Cryorig H7 for cpu cooler instead and get cheaper RAM, that's massively overkill. The 960 actually scales really well, it's about 1.8x performance and almost exactly 2x in well optimised (for SLI) gamesExactly. The only thing that's a risk of dying is the fans on these cards which can be replaced for &lt;20 bucks. People need to stop worrying about using mining cards. Normal? Absolutely not. Okay? Yes. 


As other commenters have said, it depends on which CPU/GPU. And instant damage doesn't occur until 110-130 degrees which is when the die will melt. Never run above the max temperature listed by the manufacturer for long periods of time though. 

Nice little build. Please do something about your cable management though, and the GTX 950 is much better than the 750Ti.Yes they do, doesn't make any difference to what I said though :) No, if you're going for a gaming PC, go with Intel for the CPU. Yes it is, extremely important. Intel i5s perform way better in games than AMD's most powerful CPU. [This is all I need to post](http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2182-fallout-4-cpu-benchmark-huge-performance-difference) 


I hope you realise that you're wrong and that you stop arguing about this, it's a dead subject. Everybody agrees that until AMD releases Zen, their CPUs are dead in the gaming market. Dude my 3770K needs 1.360V for 4.5Ghz and it won't go higher no matter what. The 750D has horrible, horrible airflow. Get another case or get the 750D Airflow Edition Go for Titan X's and watercool them. Because it's garbage for that much money You didn't specify that. If you have the damn case don't be lazy, take a measuring tool and figure it out yourself :/Because the GPU is absolute garbage and it won't play any games at all. If this isn't for gaming, then you still overplayed because you can get a machine for office work for ~500 dollars that will feel just as fast as this one and be more reliable at the same time. Doesn't mean your chip is terrible. It's just below average. Yeah... :(2000 dollar build and a Corsair CX powersupply... Ugh.. 


Edit: Get this unit instead. 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20750xr


3 years of warranty on the Corsair CX vs 10 years of warranty on the EVGA G2, enough said right there. Guess which one is more reliable. Edited my comment with a replacement powersupply. Looks good. Why a locked CPU with a Z170 motherboard? That's kind of a waste of money. You already have DDR3 RAM, do your wallet a favor and get the i7 4790K and a good Z97 motherboard. The 4790K is better and cheaper than the 6600K and it's easily overclockable to match or beat the 6700K. 


In 5-ish years the 6700K and 6600K will be just as outdated as the 4790K, a new socket will be available by that time so there is no "futureproofing" in going for 1151 over 1150.Oh yeah, forgot about that. My point still stands though. 4790K is cheaper than the 6600K right now. I should really read posts before commenting on the parts. Get a better powersupply. Seasonic units are reasonably priced here, get one of those. The CX is way worse. The RM series isn't the best, but it's not bad. You only need about 500W though. Where do you live? I bet you can get a better PSU than the RM 750 around the same price. Check out CoolerMaster's Silencio fansGet the i5 6500 instead, it's way better value, and get a different case. I've seen some N200 builds and cable management is a damn nightmare in that thing, there's barely any room at all, look into Fractal Design and NZXT cases, their cheap cases are great. And the 600W version is currently actually cheaper than the 500W version of EVGA's B series. Second build looks pretty good but get a better powersupply than that if you're after longevity. Corsair's RMx and RMi series are miles better than the regular RM series. HX / HXi / AX / AXi series are also very good. Seasonic powersupplies are great, EVGA, XFX, Superflower are great too. Good. Take his other component picks though, a z170 motherboard is a waste of money on a locked CPU. Check for Corsair's higher end units (RMi/RMx/HX/HXi/AX/AXi), Seasonic, EVGA, XFX, Superflower Leadex units.. Avoid EVGA's cheapest units and their NEX series, B2/G2/P2/GS/PS are great. HX850i here, awesome PSU indeed :) Looks good, but I'd go for a DDR4 motherboard and DDR4 RAM if you're going with Skylake. Feels weird using DDR3 on a Skylake build especially if you don't already have the DDR3 laying around. As in better built, more reliable, more stable, etc.RMx units are awesome. Some of the best PSUs around. I bought my old 80+ Silver HX850 4 years ago, RMAd it a while back and got upgraded to a HX850i 80+ Platinum. Fuck yeah Corsair. You're welcome :)  Just remove your motherboard and RAM from pcpartpicker, go add DDR4 RAM and then go pick a motherboard. Pcpartpicker will filter all DDR3 boards out and only show you compatible DDR4 boards. AMD GPUs? Fuck yeah. 


AMD CPUs? Fuck no. 



I really hope AMD's release of Zen will change this because I like AMD more as a company, but their CPUs just suck for gaming right now. Why not? Their customer service is awesome. Overrated, maybe, but their products are generally awesome and their support is great, so I like them for that :)Which is a large reason why AMD is still doing pretty well financially. Their chips are so old and so cheap to make at this point that they're the obvious choice for consoles. ...he can just update the BIOS, he should definitely get the 4790K. The 4770K may be impossible to cool depending on his luck. Yes avoid auto voltage. LLC auto I think he means. 


Play around with LLC settings and see which setting works best for you. It differs per board and per person. You won't void the warranty anyway, unless you flash a custom BIOS. I find that extremely doubtful. Do some CPU intensive task and you'll see it go up in temperature. Don't, just try and test each setting and see which one gives you the least amount of voltage vluctiatuon. Up everything as far as it'll go, the 750Ti doesn't run very hot so it has a ton of headroom. Yeah.... My 3770K is also made of piece of shit silicon.. I need 1.370-ish for 4.5Ghz and it won't go any higher, I can't even do 4.6Ghz at 1.45V and I've gone all the way up to 1.550V to try and get 4.7Ghz stable, it won't do it. :(That RAM is way too slow for your APU :(

Can you still return it and get a 2133 or 2400Mhz kit? The APU uses system memory (RAM) as VRAM, the faster your RAM is the better your APU will perform. It actually makes a significant difference. 1866 is better than 1600 of course but performance increase are pretty significant each step up, after 2400Mhz you start getting diminishing returns. It's definitely important. The 550Ti is better than the iGPU indeed, but at that point you're better off returning your 7870K and swapping it out for an 860K which is the same CPU but without the integrated graphics, and (I think) higher clock speed and better overclocking capability. It's also significantly cheaper. (70-ish dollars) There's no issues with my thermals, my 3770K is delidded and performing so great thermally, it's just a shitty piece of silicon. I can't seem to find them in the US either. I'm in the Netherlands. 

Check out these two fans, they're both very good. The cheaper one moves a bit less air but is quieter and comes with rubber mounting thingies. 



http://pcpartpicker.com/part/fractal-design-case-fan-fdfanssr2120



http://pcpartpicker.com/part/be-quiet-case-fan-bl046
AMD GPUs? Fuck yeah. 



AMD CPUs? Fuck no. Not until they release Zen anyway. Just gonna add myself to the Gigabyte train here. I really like Gigabyte boards too. Avoid Asus if you value good customer service, otherwise their products are good...... 


Only if you download and flash the wrong BIOS, just get it from your motherboard manufacturers website and make sure it's the right one. Don't reboot during the flashing process and you'll be fine, it's not "extremely risky" as long as you do it right. Then make sure you do it right. Why? Ivy Bridge can easily run 1.4V as long as you keep temperatures under 80 degrees. You should definitely push your chip further, 4.5Ghz at 1.18V is amazing, I'm so jealous! The 380 is way, way more powerful than the 760.Dude you're mixing so many terms and names up I think you should do a whole lot more research before getting into this stuff. It's nvidia, and it's a GPU, not a CPU. In you  message above you also suggest that Intel makes GPUs which they don't as far as I know. That's beautiful. I've always loved small form factor PCs but I'll never build one, I value expandability too much. Great job on the build, very solid component choices all around. How are those thermaltake fans? They sell those in RGB too right? I love the ring, looks so good. What you're doing right now is unacceptable.... 



**Where are the pictures?**Do they move a good amount of air at 1100RPM? Dude please stop mixing C and G up its an important detail. Yes you can run AMD **G**PUs with Intel **C**PUs. Well think before you post then :P 

Not trying to be a dick but it's an important detail since AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. Maybe stick to Processors and Videocards if the abbreviations are confusing for you. That ehh, that doesn't really mean much :P 

Does it feel like they blow a good amount of air when you hold your hand by the exhaust? How about the Cryorig H7?Netgear just because Asus has horrible customer service and I hate them. A 120mm AIO will perform much worse than a 212 Evo. 



Source: I have a Corsair H60 and my friend has a 212 Evo. 


Look into something like a large air cooler or a 240mm AIO. Or be ballsy and delid your 4670K.Absolutely not, no, don't even try to run any GPU off that thing. Throw it away. Alright, great :) 

Thank you. Honestly I know jack shit about these things. I bet there's a specific subreddit for it. Looks like you're right, must've been a mistake on my part. Why is my source moronic? No need to insult me, come on. Blowing hot air into your PSU? Ouch. I hope you have a good PSU that can handle so much heat. No you didn't offend me that's silly, I didn't know you had dyslexia so I'm sorry. If the similar looking abbreviations are difficult for you you could stick to saying processors and graphics cards / video cards. It was personal experience, I put my exact CPU in his computer, both out cases have good airflow but I overlooked one small... Huge detail. His room is much colder than mine. You don't have to get so hostile Generally when recommending a cooler you'd actually test it before recommending it. You haven't tested your cooler properly yet, your CPU hasn't put out any serious heat because you haven't done anything demanding on your system. It's pretty fair to assume people actually use their powerful systems for power hungry tasks, it sounds like you wasted a huge amount of money on such a powerful system since you're not using it. That's just a single picture of all your boxes :/Jeez, your 3770K also has a terrible connection between the die and the heatspreader it seems. That's really sad :( 

Hours of gaming and programs running in the background must have pushed it over 35 degrees, right...? Are you sure you're not mistaken? Ohhh....... :l


Build looks great man :P May want to separate those links. I understand your point, maybe I was wrong in calling it hostile, but you weren't exactly nice to call what I say moronic.

&amp;nbsp;


 Yes I took my CPU out of my computer, cleaned the thermal paste off, put it in his computer with the exact same thermal paste, put his cooler (cleaned) back on, overclocked it to the same speed on the same voltage, ran benchmarks and stress tests, and then..... I took and sold his old CPU. I gave him mine because I got an upgrade. Ah, okay. 600W is plenty, and that's a pretty good quality unit afaik so you're good. I'm expecting an update from you young lady. That comparison site is pretty bad, but just know that the 860K is literally the exact same CPU as the 7870K, without the integrated graphics. So clock speed is the direct way to compare the two here. How does Rocket League run on your system? I suggest you use a program that monitors all of this and remembers the maximum like MSI Afterburner. 


I'm obsessed with knowing what's going on with my computer, I know all my temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, etc. from the top of my head and I notice immediately if something is off. Your claims aren't outrageous, they're just very unlikely. You could be living in a very cold house, and your games may not be very CPU intensive. Maybe your CPU really hasn't gone above 35 degrees, which is possible if your house is only 15-ish, which is doubtful as I initially said :PThe fuck is wrong with this guy? It looks like he's trying to kill that monkey. I get that it's a fight and all but using all your strength to kick an animal many times smaller than you is fucked up. Arma 3 is CPU intensive in general iirc, and live streaming is definitely CPU intensive. Afterburner has a 'detachable' monitoring window which records pretty much everything. I'm not sure if Corsair Link actually records the maximum temperature or if it only displays current temperature, I have it, but I don't use it.. How many FPS is 'amazing'? Your motherboard is great. What cooler do you have? Use AIDA 64 to monitor speed, temps and to stress test. It's a nice all in one program. CPU-Z for voltage monitoring. Do you have to get everything from NCIX specifically? Can't you order from different sites? That could end up being much cheaper. Also don't buy Corsair CX powersupplies. The CX series is bad. It's significantly more expensive and a waste of money to do so. Building a computer isn't hard, trust me, it really isn't. It's like expensive legos, there are manuals and things usually only fit one way. I can personally guide you through the whole process if you'd like. I'm working on putting a build together for you hold on a minute.

And this is what it'd look like if you got your parts from all over the place. That's over 200 dollars of difference which could be used to significantly upgrade the hardware of your computer, or to buy a few cool games. This whole system is still under budget anyway, you have room for even better parts if you want. Aright fair enough I guess, but take a look at the build I suggested. Right on the 1500 dollar mark and all from NCIX, also a lot better than the build you have put together in your post. :) Please don't recommend Corsair's CX powersupplies. Not for a high end system like this. They're low end units for low end builds.



Edit: Down vote me for spreading correct information, whoo! Great job guys. An SSD is absolutely worth it, I paid 180 euros for my 128GB SSD in 2011, back then 180 euros was like 250 USD and probably even more CAD. I have no regrets whatsoever and I'll never go back to a mechanical hard drive as my main drive, it's just way too damn slow. An SSD hugely improves the general speed of the computer outside of gaming, any computer with a regular hard drive, no matter how good the specs, will feel slow after you've used an SSD. 


&amp;nbsp;


It may seem like I'm exaggerating but I'm really not, that's the best part. Everybody agrees on this :P Definitely do get the suggested powersupply. I know it's expensive but it's top quality and it has 5 (I think?) years of warranty. Maybe 7, I'm not sure, either way this is an awesome unit and it's **way** more reliable than Corsair's CX series. A good case is very nice for airflow and ease of use. Build quality also comes to mind. If you can afford it I'd say don't step it down, or even step it up. Your choice. That SSD is awfully expensive, I'm sure there are cheaper options. Look at the NCIX build I posted below, that Adata SSD is better *and* cheaper than the Kingston SSD. 


FYI, this is referred to as storage, not memory. Memory = RAM :) What the fuck? Why doesn't NCIX list the good stuff there? That's pretty sad. 


120GB is enough for your OS and programs but it's the same price as the 240GB one from my post, and it's from their own damn website. That's bullshit. Wtf NCIX.. Cons: 

-More expensive

&amp;nbsp;


Pros: 

+More reliable 

+Longer warranty 

+More energy efficient 

+Fully modular 

+QuieterYes, it should be your primary/main drive. You'll install all your programs (not games) on it and everything on the SSD will be extremely fast. Your computer will start in ~10 seconds, all your programs will open pretty much instantly, basically all waiting will be gone. Try to cut down slightly wherever possible and squeeze an i5 4460 in, other than that it looks good. That EVGA B2 powersupply is also very good, nice pick. Pretty much. I'd put steam itself (the program) on the SSD and then go into steam settings and make it download and install all games onto your hard drive. All small programs go on your SSD so you don't fill it up, large games and files go onto your hard drive. Basically all those EVGA ones are good, the regular B units are not as good as the other ones but they're still not as bad as Corsair's CX units. The G1 650W would be best, with 10 years of warranty. [Here's a review](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=442). 


There has to be cheaper RAM, motherboard, case (Fractal has great &lt;100 dollar cases) and DVD drive right? Yeah sounds good to me. I have a few smaller games on my SSD as well but I wouldn't go putting something like GTA V (60GB) on it. I said cheaper, not get rid of it :P 


Don't you have a dvd drive from your old computer? And the CPU will show when you play CPU intensive games like Fallout 4, GTA V and Skyrim. It's not going to make those games unplayable though. No you can't, 10 year old ones have different connectors. How often do you use the DVD drive though? Do you really need it? You could always throw one in later on, and save the money right now. Lol, sure, just keep an eye on how much storage space you have left and on whether or not you need that program to load quickly, and how big that program is. Full SSDs are unhappy SSDs :PNo, it comes with a cooler. You can always add a quieter cooler later on when you have some extra money to spend. [It's this little piece of shit](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/pchardware/images/d/dc/AMDandIntelHeatsinkRoundup-jmke-14626.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090608213948) (which will do just fine, don't worry) Keep it at 8GB for sure. If you get the EVGA G1 650W powersupply you'll be able to afford the i5, right? http://lmgtfy.com/?q=PSU :PThe former. Doesn't matter. If your case comes with one you should just throw it out because it'll likely be garbage quality. The only case I know of with a good powersupply is the EVGA Hadron(?). Looks great. EVGA's B2 units are very good and y
