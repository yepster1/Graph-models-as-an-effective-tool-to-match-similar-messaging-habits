 Galen's home address is as follows.  Several people had asked for it to send cards.  I am sure he would appreicate the thoughts and prayers.  Home Address 10622 Endicott Lane Houston, TX  77318   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.   John, will you verify with Charlie that Rick Kile and Ronnie have the lead on this and that he is not waiting on us for anything.  Thanks. Lynn 
 It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully) surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital (Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.  I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that. Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with his Mom.  Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.  As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.  Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn 
 Rick, if you have some time on Tuesday, I would like to visit with you about this.  I don't want this move to be any more negative than what it is.  I have a possible game plan I would like to talk with you about and then maybe you and I need to take Larry and Raetta to lunch give them a chance to talk and then let them know our next steps. Glad you are back.  Lynn 
 Kelly, this would not send to the "Outlook Migration team".  So I am sending it to you Ava.  Ava, Please get with Kelly and find out how we send it to the team.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Joe, are you and Gary up to speed on this ElPaso outage on the 26th?  Any concerns on our side?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, can you follow up with the team, Chris and Sue to be sure we are all on the same page on this issue?  Thanks. Lynn

 Ava, thanks for the update.  Please let me know how the session goes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, thanks for your prompt reply.  Lynn 
 Ava, can you sign me up for the Tuesday, June 26?  If I am not available, could you spend some time with me and train me after my conversion next week?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, what did this mean to shippers nominating on NNG's pipe?  Do they have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes?  If so, how did we communicate to the shippers.  How does this effect OBA's? Thanks for the update.  Lynn 
 Toby, Terry and I talked about this and I will address it again in next weeks team leader meeting.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  The teams should be aware of the procedure.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sharon, I am doing very well but cannot come back to work until Tuesday.  They will remove all the drain tubes Monday. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  I'll see you on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please be sure this is on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, where are we on training?  Are we OK for end of month billing?  THanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  to keep you in the loop.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.  This is on the Bushton Measurement arbitration.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I am fine with this schedule.  I am a little concerned about Lynda testing because of Galen being out and the team shortage.  Should we have a back up to Lynda if she cannot get away from the day to day so we do not loose any time on the testing.  Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Brian, just wanted to follow up to be sure you had talked with Toby Kuehl and he had answered all your questions.  If you have all your answers, you do not need to respond to this note.  Have a great day.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mary, we would love to have you come.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you taken care of this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you taken care of this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, can you have the teams getting Ava email addresses on the list this week if Dennis does not already have them in PLE.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just wanted to be sure everyone had a copy of this letter.  In relation to this letter we had a posting go out on the WEB.  Please be sure everyone on the team has read this notice.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, are you going to be available for this meeting?  I would like to know the outcome of the meeting in relation to any concerns on sending out invoices.    Thanks. Lynn 
 Ricki, I just wanted to follow up, I was told Cynthia and Linda neither one had damage.  Cynthia's mother and sister had flooding and Linda was without electricity for awhile.  If you are hearing something different, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, just to keep you in the loop since I am out next wee.  This is the information we sent to Regulatory (Mary Darveaux) as we finalize info on the Strangers Gas Settlement. Tangie is working closely with Mary and will get her what she needs.  we are also working with Dan Fancler and Debbie Mosley in Finanace.    If you have any questions, please let Tangie or Raetta (who is working with Tangie on this) know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 terry, are these instructions on the Intranet where we have critical and no= n critical procedures?  If not, can we put them out there?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Larry, I want to know if you did not get the response you needed.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep ya'll in the loop.  This fix should be ready for test on Monday and migrated Monday night for Tuesday's use.  This fix will be very beneficial in minimizing Shipper imbalances on NNG.  Terry and Gerry will work with the teams to be sure everyone is up to speed on the change.  If you have any questions while I am out next week, please check with Terry Kowalke or Mike Bodnar.   Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's go ahead with this day and time.  I will cover for John.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report and the automation of the storage report.  Let's discuss on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made.  One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava and John, please let me know if we are not going to have this info by Tuesday.  THanks. Lynn 
 John, can you follow up on the new delivery point for Wisconsin Gas.  Is there a better procedure with contracts/PLE to ensure we have all new points set up properly for operator confirmation.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, very valid concern.  Do we need to re-look at our procedure?	  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  To keep you guys in the loop.  As we get additional info, I will pass it on. Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you guys in the loop.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jean, Glen is still working on my computer.  He should have it done today.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, go ahead and take off as long as you have all your move ready to go.  Be sure to have someone covering your desk.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Audrey, its on my calendar.  I am looking forward to the event.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, looks good to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, to answer #5, Kim Hardman and/or Delaine Kurth may be added to the cc on the letter.  The reason I mention Delaine is Jerry Knight (who works for Delaine) is the person that has been calling Robert Benningfield asking for the status of the 12 - 16 adjustment.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question.  The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)  For Nominating purposes:  MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.  Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.  EXAMPLE:  If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be overrun at IT rate.  If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Steve and Audrey, thank you so much for the invitation, but I will be at the NNG Customer meeting in Kansas City otherwise I would plan on attending. Have a great time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, can you check this out for me.  Did the team drop the ball on this one? Thanks. Lynn 
 We need to discuss ASAP this morning.  Legale, would you be available at 8:30?  We can meet in my office.  Gerry, sounds like Legale is who we were looking for.  You are welcome to set in, but not necessary.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Are you guys up to speed on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Robert, is there to be a written resolution plan as you come to agreement?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.  For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning. Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. Saturday morning.  On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.  Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore most of the gas is staying in the east market.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Bob, can you resend this to me.  I cannot open the file.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, Ava is gone until tomorrow afternoon.  See if Sharon or Alma can help out.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Vernon, October 4th works for me.  John I think you are gone, so we need to involve Terry in this.  I am very open Thursday or Friday for a pre meeting.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Please put on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please code them as personal time with pay.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I was working 1 - 15th.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing. If you have any questions, please let me know. 
 Raetta and Robert, let's talk about some kind of closure on these resolutions. Can we talk tomorrow at 1:30 in my office?  Thanks. Lynn 
 It's on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please update my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Due to all the moves this week, we are canceling the staff meeting this afternoon.  We will have a regular meeting next week.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta can not meeting today.  How about Thursday at 1:30.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tim, I would like for us to discuss this issue. Normally we do not "settle" on these type of issues.  I want to be consistent with how we have treated other shippers when we have found errors in the system.  Doesn't mean we can't do a settlement,  we just don't want it to back fire on us.  Ava, please set up some time on Thursday for Tim, Mike, Bob, Sue and I to visit.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, would you please check with Joe on the problems with lights and air conditioning per the attached memo.  Do we need to call security for anything?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gina, let's do lunch and I'll answer all your questions.  Are you available Wed. or Thursday?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, thanks for the update.  Please keep us posted.  If I need to make a phone call, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Coffee on Thursday sounds great.  Just give me a call.  Have a great day with your Mom.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, I scheduled a meeting per Drew's request with my team that deals with the Bushton area.  Drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful about using the term "PTR calculation" for measurement error adjustments.  We thought it would be good for you to attend as well.  I want the team to understand how important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about Bushton issues.  Hopefully you can attend.  Although I think the meeting may be scheduled to 10:00 a.m. instead of 9:30.  Hopefully that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, we look into this for another party at one time?  Do you recall what all would be necessary to accomodate this request?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava has willingly taken on this task.  So she will be the point person going forward.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Good job in getting this done.  How are we coming with the other operators?  With us moving forward for Shirley to work from home, emails will be much better than faxes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gary, thank you for your help. I guess Ricki was having quite a time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gerry, do you have some time tomorrow, Thursday, that you, Terry, John and I can set down and review what you have a put a "blurb" together to send to the customers. I am open 10:00 to 11:00 or anytime after 2:00.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Amy, we still have Julia White on the attached form.  Can you work with Terry to remove Julia's name and add Shelley's?  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, I talked with Donna and got back with Bob Burleson.  Let's see what his answer is and then I may have you and Donna work on this one.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Nancy, good job.  Keep up the good work.  See if you can get the rest of your team to follow suit with their interconnects.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  John I think you are gone.  But Terry, thought you might be interested. I am planning on attending.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Since Robert is working evenings, who has the lead to get the daily Oneok reports out?  Thanks. Lynn 
 terry, I am not sure understand the discrepancies on numbers in teh #4 file.  Let's discuss. Thanks. Lynn 
 Looks good to me.  Are we going to put this letter in the reservation invoice packet?  Also, would we want to post the letter anywhere on the web?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Scott, I appreicate your feedback and closure on these items.  It helps us to build that confidence that the systems are working correctly instead of being left in "limbo" and coming up with your own conclusions.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, this is what prompted my questions about finalizing resolution.  Thanks Lynn 
 John is out of the office until Wednesday.  He sent me this list of topics he caught in the second break out session.  Thought I would go ahead and pass them on to you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is our first pass at some questions and answers to post to the WEB based on discussions at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting.  Please review and let me know if you feel there needs to be more "in depth" answers to these questions.    Or are there additional questions that you feel need to be added. 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn  > 
 Ava, FYI.  Has Alma been working with you on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Virgil, I wanted to say "Thank You" for your time and effort given to our new employees as they toured your facilities in Vidor on Tuesday, September 25.  I know it was the first time most of them had been to a compressor station and they found it very interesting.  This was one step in our efforts to help them match the Physical world (Operations) with the Paper world (Nominations, invoices, etc).  Please pass on my "Thanks" to the others that contributed to this educational process.  Lynn Blair 
 John and Terry, where are we on this budget.  I want to be sure there are not issues coming up while John is on vacation !!!!  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, FYI.  Drew, Britt and I are meeting with the So. Central Team on Monday, October 1, at 10:00 a.m. for 30 minutes.  It is not the best time for everyone, but it was the best way to get the most people and get the meeting ASAP.  We will leave a person on the team to cover phones, plus the North end team is going to help watch the phone for that 30 minutes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09Sharon, are they going to move the frig to 42?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sounds good to me.  It leaves us some flexibility.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, thank you for taking care of this.  I really appreciate your pro active involvement with the new hires as well as helping Ava out.  Thanks again.  Lynn 
 Brad, just some comments.  At the end do we want to say Customer Services Rep instead of Market Service Rep.  and should we put the Hottap help desk phone number in that particular Hottap help desk bullitt. Just a thought.  Otherwise looks great.   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thought you would be interested since most of you have worked with Robert over the years with the NBPL interconnects.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is an updated list of questions after everyone's input.  I would like to discuss the changes with you after Shelley's staff meeting.  Appreciate everyone's input.     Thanks. Lynn

 Toby, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Robert, was there a problem getting the weekend notes out last night?  Shelley pulls the recap for each pipe by 7:30 a.m. for Stan's staff meeting on Mondays.  I just need to make sure everyone understands the urgency (especially on Mondays) to have the updates sent Sunday night.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sounds like a plan to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thought you guys would be interested in Phil's comments.  Steve, I think you need to be in this meeting.  Anyone else want to attend?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, FYI.  I didn't know if you would be able to make this meeting.  Terry is coming until 2:30 then he will attend Steve Harris' meeting.  If you need to stay on the floor, that is no problem.  I will update you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, thanks for the keys.  I appreciate you staying on top of this.  Thanks. Lynn

 Teams, it is very important that you attend these meetings before you work the weekend.  This will give us an opportunity to ensure everyone has the same understanding of EDI procedures.  Mary and Jim, please keep a signed list of who attends training so we can add this to our Training list for 2001.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, can you check with marketing to see if they have put the right rate in the system and then coordinate with Bert when he gets back tomorrow. Thanks for your help.  Lynn 
  On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable back to January, 1998.  In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very many of these issues.  Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.  My expectation is that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will ask Alice for an update.  Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in this effort.  All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001. 
 Tracy, keep up the good work.  We appreciate you staying on top of Burlington's business.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I am assuming we are sending flowers?  You may want to check with Sherry to see if we want to wait until Kathy gets home or send to hospital.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Ava, please get Jo and I some dates for giving the Marketers a "Brown Bag" training session on Nomination, Confirmation and Scheduling process. I would like to use the video Room on 42 in Houston and 6th floor in Omaha.  I would like to look at the week of October 15th.  The session could be a brown bag from 11:30 to 1:00.  John Buchanan and I can give the presentation since Terry will be out that week.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please update my calendar with the room number changes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.   Thanks. Lynn 
  Donna, attached is a first pass draft of a letter for Shelley to send out to the teams about her up coming staff meeting.  I would appreciate your input.  You are much better at this than I am.  I tend to be to blunt sometimes.     Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Robert, we have decided to send Donna Scott and a person out of Brad's group to attend this training.  Then they will come back and do the training with each of us.  This will help minimize costs and yet give us the opportunity for everyone to benefit from the information.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, can you follow up with the Wizard problem on TW.  Thanks. LYnn 
 Alma, hopefully, I am not too late.  If so, just let me know who has copies and I can borrow theirs.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, please plan on attending next Wednesday's meeting for the demonstration on the handheld devices.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meeting yesterday.  1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.  2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).  3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).  4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG.  5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.  After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:  1.  Measurement should either:  a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS.  b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.  2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.  Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want. I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.  If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Joni, we will see if there is enough interest in doing a make-up session, we will certainly be glad to.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Deb, yes I need to know who is attending and how many.  I will ensure we get you the handouts for Omaha ahead of time.  I will also send them to Minneapolis if there are any Marketers attending there as well.  Thanks for your help.  Lynn 
 Ava, schedule time for you, Terry and I to meet next week and talk about the training and get the handouts ready.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09Ava, please update my email lists.  Thanks. Lynn 
 We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.  At this time I think the split is OK.  I would like for you to put in writing for me the following:  Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out. I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two "old" teams merging.  For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk.  Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.  Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator.  Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering  The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps.  GPM Monthly Pricing Report Lamar Power Plant True Ups PVR Report Oneok Gathering Reporting NNG Administrative Contracts SPS Power Plant True Up Conoco Power Plant True Up MOPS Daily Report  The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:  Duke/GPM Oneok Transcanada Dynegy Reliant ElPaso West Texas Gas  If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, did we have problems this weekend?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Frank, since this never happened, are we going to meet with Mark Woofter to resolve this issue? Do Steve and I need to come up and sit down with you and Mark and come to a resolution that works for everyone?  Just let us know how you would like to handle.  Thanks for all your help. Lynn 
 Maggie, Terry and Hasan, I would like to meet with you and Sheila to review both reports
