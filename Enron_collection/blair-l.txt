 Galen's home address is as follows.  Several people had asked for it to send cards.  I am sure he would appreicate the thoughts and prayers.  Home Address 10622 Endicott Lane Houston, TX  77318   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.   John, will you verify with Charlie that Rick Kile and Ronnie have the lead on this and that he is not waiting on us for anything.  Thanks. Lynn 
 It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully) surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital (Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.  I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that. Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with his Mom.  Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.  As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.  Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn 
 Rick, if you have some time on Tuesday, I would like to visit with you about this.  I don't want this move to be any more negative than what it is.  I have a possible game plan I would like to talk with you about and then maybe you and I need to take Larry and Raetta to lunch give them a chance to talk and then let them know our next steps. Glad you are back.  Lynn 
 Kelly, this would not send to the "Outlook Migration team".  So I am sending it to you Ava.  Ava, Please get with Kelly and find out how we send it to the team.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Joe, are you and Gary up to speed on this ElPaso outage on the 26th?  Any concerns on our side?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, can you follow up with the team, Chris and Sue to be sure we are all on the same page on this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  I am sure you are already up to speed.  Glad your back.  See ya on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, thanks for the update.  Please let me know how the session goes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, thanks for your prompt reply.  Lynn 
 Ava, can you sign me up for the Tuesday, June 26?  If I am not available, could you spend some time with me and train me after my conversion next week?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, what did this mean to shippers nominating on NNG's pipe?  Do they have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes?  If so, how did we communicate to the shippers.  How does this effect OBA's? Thanks for the update.  Lynn 
 Toby, Terry and I talked about this and I will address it again in next weeks team leader meeting.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  The teams should be aware of the procedure.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sharon, I am doing very well but cannot come back to work until Tuesday.  They will remove all the drain tubes Monday. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  I'll see you on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please be sure this is on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, where are we on training?  Are we OK for end of month billing?  THanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  to keep you in the loop.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.  This is on the Bushton Measurement arbitration.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I am fine with this schedule.  I am a little concerned about Lynda testing because of Galen being out and the team shortage.  Should we have a back up to Lynda if she cannot get away from the day to day so we do not loose any time on the testing.  Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Brian, just wanted to follow up to be sure you had talked with Toby Kuehl and he had answered all your questions.  If you have all your answers, you do not need to respond to this note.  Have a great day.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mary, we would love to have you come.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you taken care of this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you taken care of this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, can you have the teams getting Ava email addresses on the list this week if Dennis does not already have them in PLE.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just wanted to be sure everyone had a copy of this letter.  In relation to this letter we had a posting go out on the WEB.  Please be sure everyone on the team has read this notice.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, are you going to be available for this meeting?  I would like to know the outcome of the meeting in relation to any concerns on sending out invoices.    Thanks. Lynn 
 Ricki, I just wanted to follow up, I was told Cynthia and Linda neither one had damage.  Cynthia's mother and sister had flooding and Linda was without electricity for awhile.  If you are hearing something different, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, just to keep you in the loop since I am out next wee.  This is the information we sent to Regulatory (Mary Darveaux) as we finalize info on the Strangers Gas Settlement. Tangie is working closely with Mary and will get her what she needs.  we are also working with Dan Fancler and Debbie Mosley in Finanace.    If you have any questions, please let Tangie or Raetta (who is working with Tangie on this) know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 terry, are these instructions on the Intranet where we have critical and no= n critical procedures?  If not, can we put them out there?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Larry, I want to know if you did not get the response you needed.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep ya'll in the loop.  This fix should be ready for test on Monday and migrated Monday night for Tuesday's use.  This fix will be very beneficial in minimizing Shipper imbalances on NNG.  Terry and Gerry will work with the teams to be sure everyone is up to speed on the change.  If you have any questions while I am out next week, please check with Terry Kowalke or Mike Bodnar.   Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's go ahead with this day and time.  I will cover for John.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report and the automation of the storage report.  Let's discuss on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made.  One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava and John, please let me know if we are not going to have this info by Tuesday.  THanks. Lynn 
 John, can you follow up on the new delivery point for Wisconsin Gas.  Is there a better procedure with contracts/PLE to ensure we have all new points set up properly for operator confirmation.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, very valid concern.  Do we need to re-look at our procedure?	  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  To keep you guys in the loop.  As we get additional info, I will pass it on. Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you guys in the loop.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jean, Glen is still working on my computer.  He should have it done today.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, go ahead and take off as long as you have all your move ready to go.  Be sure to have someone covering your desk.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Audrey, its on my calendar.  I am looking forward to the event.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, looks good to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, to answer #5, Kim Hardman and/or Delaine Kurth may be added to the cc on the letter.  The reason I mention Delaine is Jerry Knight (who works for Delaine) is the person that has been calling Robert Benningfield asking for the status of the 12 - 16 adjustment.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question.  The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)  For Nominating purposes:  MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.  Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.  EXAMPLE:  If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be overrun at IT rate.  If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Steve and Audrey, thank you so much for the invitation, but I will be at the NNG Customer meeting in Kansas City otherwise I would plan on attending. Have a great time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, can you check this out for me.  Did the team drop the ball on this one? Thanks. Lynn 
 We need to discuss ASAP this morning.  Legale, would you be available at 8:30?  We can meet in my office.  Gerry, sounds like Legale is who we were looking for.  You are welcome to set in, but not necessary.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Are you guys up to speed on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Robert, is there to be a written resolution plan as you come to agreement?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.  For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning. Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. Saturday morning.  On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.  Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore most of the gas is staying in the east market.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Bob, can you resend this to me.  I cannot open the file.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, Ava is gone until tomorrow afternoon.  See if Sharon or Alma can help out.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Vernon, October 4th works for me.  John I think you are gone, so we need to involve Terry in this.  I am very open Thursday or Friday for a pre meeting.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Please put on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please code them as personal time with pay.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I was working 1 - 15th.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing. If you have any questions, please let me know. 
 Raetta and Robert, let's talk about some kind of closure on these resolutions. Can we talk tomorrow at 1:30 in my office?  Thanks. Lynn 
 It's on my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please update my calendar.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Due to all the moves this week, we are canceling the staff meeting this afternoon.  We will have a regular meeting next week.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta can not meeting today.  How about Thursday at 1:30.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tim, I would like for us to discuss this issue. Normally we do not "settle" on these type of issues.  I want to be consistent with how we have treated other shippers when we have found errors in the system.  Doesn't mean we can't do a settlement,  we just don't want it to back fire on us.  Ava, please set up some time on Thursday for Tim, Mike, Bob, Sue and I to visit.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, would you please check with Joe on the problems with lights and air conditioning per the attached memo.  Do we need to call security for anything?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gina, let's do lunch and I'll answer all your questions.  Are you available Wed. or Thursday?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, thanks for the update.  Please keep us posted.  If I need to make a phone call, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Coffee on Thursday sounds great.  Just give me a call.  Have a great day with your Mom.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Britt, I scheduled a meeting per Drew's request with my team that deals with the Bushton area.  Drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful about using the term "PTR calculation" for measurement error adjustments.  We thought it would be good for you to attend as well.  I want the team to understand how important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about Bushton issues.  Hopefully you can attend.  Although I think the meeting may be scheduled to 10:00 a.m. instead of 9:30.  Hopefully that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, we look into this for another party at one time?  Do you recall what all would be necessary to accomodate this request?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava has willingly taken on this task.  So she will be the point person going forward.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Good job in getting this done.  How are we coming with the other operators?  With us moving forward for Shirley to work from home, emails will be much better than faxes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gary, thank you for your help. I guess Ricki was having quite a time.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gerry, do you have some time tomorrow, Thursday, that you, Terry, John and I can set down and review what you have a put a "blurb" together to send to the customers. I am open 10:00 to 11:00 or anytime after 2:00.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Amy, we still have Julia White on the attached form.  Can you work with Terry to remove Julia's name and add Shelley's?  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, I talked with Donna and got back with Bob Burleson.  Let's see what his answer is and then I may have you and Donna work on this one.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Nancy, good job.  Keep up the good work.  See if you can get the rest of your team to follow suit with their interconnects.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  John I think you are gone.  But Terry, thought you might be interested. I am planning on attending.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Since Robert is working evenings, who has the lead to get the daily Oneok reports out?  Thanks. Lynn 
 terry, I am not sure understand the discrepancies on numbers in teh #4 file.  Let's discuss. Thanks. Lynn 
 Looks good to me.  Are we going to put this letter in the reservation invoice packet?  Also, would we want to post the letter anywhere on the web?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Scott, I appreicate your feedback and closure on these items.  It helps us to build that confidence that the systems are working correctly instead of being left in "limbo" and coming up with your own conclusions.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, this is what prompted my questions about finalizing resolution.  Thanks Lynn 
 John is out of the office until Wednesday.  He sent me this list of topics he caught in the second break out session.  Thought I would go ahead and pass them on to you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is our first pass at some questions and answers to post to the WEB based on discussions at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting.  Please review and let me know if you feel there needs to be more "in depth" answers to these questions.    Or are there additional questions that you feel need to be added. 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn  > 
 Ava, FYI.  Has Alma been working with you on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Virgil, I wanted to say "Thank You" for your time and effort given to our new employees as they toured your facilities in Vidor on Tuesday, September 25.  I know it was the first time most of them had been to a compressor station and they found it very interesting.  This was one step in our efforts to help them match the Physical world (Operations) with the Paper world (Nominations, invoices, etc).  Please pass on my "Thanks" to the others that contributed to this educational process.  Lynn Blair 
 John and Terry, where are we on this budget.  I want to be sure there are not issues coming up while John is on vacation !!!!  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, FYI.  Drew, Britt and I are meeting with the So. Central Team on Monday, October 1, at 10:00 a.m. for 30 minutes.  It is not the best time for everyone, but it was the best way to get the most people and get the meeting ASAP.  We will leave a person on the team to cover phones, plus the North end team is going to help watch the phone for that 30 minutes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09Sharon, are they going to move the frig to 42?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sounds good to me.  It leaves us some flexibility.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, thank you for taking care of this.  I really appreciate your pro active involvement with the new hires as well as helping Ava out.  Thanks again.  Lynn 
 Brad, just some comments.  At the end do we want to say Customer Services Rep instead of Market Service Rep.  and should we put the Hottap help desk phone number in that particular Hottap help desk bullitt. Just a thought.  Otherwise looks great.   Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thought you would be interested since most of you have worked with Robert over the years with the NBPL interconnects.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is an updated list of questions after everyone's input.  I would like to discuss the changes with you after Shelley's staff meeting.  Appreciate everyone's input.     Thanks. Lynn

 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Toby, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Robert, was there a problem getting the weekend notes out last night?  Shelley pulls the recap for each pipe by 7:30 a.m. for Stan's staff meeting on Mondays.  I just need to make sure everyone understands the urgency (especially on Mondays) to have the updates sent Sunday night.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sounds like a plan to me.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thought you guys would be interested in Phil's comments.  Steve, I think you need to be in this meeting.  Anyone else want to attend?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, FYI.  I didn't know if you would be able to make this meeting.  Terry is coming until 2:30 then he will attend Steve Harris' meeting.  If you need to stay on the floor, that is no problem.  I will update you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, thanks for the keys.  I appreciate you staying on top of this.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, this is the letter from Winston that you were looking for.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Kim, I would like to buy one of the cards.  Please let me know what Ineed to do to purchase one. Thanks. Lynn 
 John, let's discuss when you get back Wednesay.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is a draft of a letter we are sending to our customers as discussed at the Winter Ops Meeting in September.  Also, we have attached a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) document that will go out with the letter and will be posted to the WEB.

 Ricki FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Teams, it is very important that you attend these meetings before you work the weekend.  This will give us an opportunity to ensure everyone has the same understanding of EDI procedures.  Mary and Jim, please keep a signed list of who attends training so we can add this to our Training list for 2001.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, can you check with marketing to see if they have put the right rate in the system and then coordinate with Bert when he gets back tomorrow. Thanks for your help.  Lynn 
  On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable back to January, 1998.  In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very many of these issues.  Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.  My expectation is that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will ask Alice for an update.  Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in this effort.  All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001. 
 Tracy, keep up the good work.  We appreciate you staying on top of Burlington's business.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I am assuming we are sending flowers?  You may want to check with Sherry to see if we want to wait until Kathy gets home or send to hospital.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Ava, please get Jo and I some dates for giving the Marketers a "Brown Bag" training session on Nomination, Confirmation and Scheduling process. I would like to use the video Room on 42 in Houston and 6th floor in Omaha.  I would like to look at the week of October 15th.  The session could be a brown bag from 11:30 to 1:00.  John Buchanan and I can give the presentation since Terry will be out that week.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please update my calendar with the room number changes.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.   Thanks. Lynn 
  Donna, attached is a first pass draft of a letter for Shelley to send out to the teams about her up coming staff meeting.  I would appreciate your input.  You are much better at this than I am.  I tend to be to blunt sometimes.     Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Robert, we have decided to send Donna Scott and a person out of Brad's group to attend this training.  Then they will come back and do the training with each of us.  This will help minimize costs and yet give us the opportunity for everyone to benefit from the information.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, can you follow up with the Wizard problem on TW.  Thanks. LYnn 
 Alma, hopefully, I am not too late.  If so, just let me know who has copies and I can borrow theirs.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, please plan on attending next Wednesday's meeting for the demonstration on the handheld devices.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meeting yesterday.  1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.  2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).  3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).  4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG.  5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.  After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:  1.  Measurement should either:  a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS.  b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.  2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.  Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want. I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.  If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Joni, we will see if there is enough interest in doing a make-up session, we will certainly be glad to.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Deb, yes I need to know who is attending and how many.  I will ensure we get you the handouts for Omaha ahead of time.  I will also send them to Minneapolis if there are any Marketers attending there as well.  Thanks for your help.  Lynn 
 Ava, schedule time for you, Terry and I to meet next week and talk about the training and get the handouts ready.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 =09Ava, please update my email lists.  Thanks. Lynn 
 We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.  At this time I think the split is OK.  I would like for you to put in writing for me the following:  Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out. I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two "old" teams merging.  For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk.  Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.  Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator.  Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering  The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps.  GPM Monthly Pricing Report Lamar Power Plant True Ups PVR Report Oneok Gathering Reporting NNG Administrative Contracts SPS Power Plant True Up Conoco Power Plant True Up MOPS Daily Report  The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:  Duke/GPM Oneok Transcanada Dynegy Reliant ElPaso West Texas Gas  If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, did we have problems this weekend?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Frank, since this never happened, are we going to meet with Mark Woofter to resolve this issue? Do Steve and I need to come up and sit down with you and Mark and come to a resolution that works for everyone?  Just let us know how you would like to handle.  Thanks for all your help. Lynn 
 Maggie, Terry and Hasan, I would like to meet with you and Sheila to review both reports before we turn anything off. How about 1:00 Tuesday, October 9th in my office or Sheila's office?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, on NNG and TW, things were quiet.  The SoCal/West of Thoreau spreadsheet is on your desk.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, FYI.  I guess she did get a ticket for $153.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, I was in the office for October 1 - 15th.   Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, Maggie and Sheila, if you get comfortable with the direction these emails are going, then we do NOT need to meet.  Let me know if you feel like we need to group together to finalize this issue and be sure we are on the same page.  Otherwise, I would ask that Maggie or Hasan do a final results email and let us know what the outcome is.  Thanks for everyone's help on getting this issue behind us. Lynn 
 Shelley, here are the four PAA's for the people who tested the flowing gas. This does not include Larry or Legale.  Brad, Rick and I are discussing how to handle these two.  The attached PAA's are for Kathy Sturr, Diana Porter, Renee Perry and Jean Adams.  If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. Lynn 
 =09The attached was sent to all the attendees at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting= .  Thought =09you might be interested in reviewing the summary.  If you have any quest= ions, please =09let me know.  Thanks. Lynn (Ext. 3-7637) 
 Lisa, I will not be able to walk, but put me down for $25.00 for you.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thought I would send this to you to approve.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, good to hear from you.  The meeting went very well. although I was very nervous about this one. Good response from the customers.  We had approximately 80 customers at the meeting.  I think that is a record.  Call me when you feel like it and I tell you more.  Hope you are feeling well.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, I'll be glad to lead the discussion.  Is this informal or do I have to have a formal presentation?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Large.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, sounds good to me.  Iike that better than a formal presentation.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Alma, please include Terry Kowalke and Darrell Schoolcraft.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jennifer, how long has this been a problem?  Is there a concern we have caused customers problems in nominating due to bad information?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Thanks Gerry.  I did not pick up on that.  Lynn 
 Richard, did this get properly taken care of?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Todd, that will be perfect.  I think we will have a very good discussion.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Shelley, we have established Monday afternoon after Steve Harris' staff meeting to meet and discuss:  1.  TW Shipper Imbalance Status  2.  OBA termination/Resolution  We will stay in the conference room on 13.  Just wanted to let you know this is replacing our Tuesday morning meeting which was not working well since everyone moved.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn   We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:  1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)  2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)  4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins. Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)  5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity.  6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.  Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Charlie, let me try calling Delaine in the morning and ask her who is next in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue.  Let's see what kind of a response I get.  If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley may need to call.  I will let you know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Todd, I am planning on attending.  Thanks. Lynn Blair 
 Tracy, thanks for staying on top of this.  It is my understanding the $6500 is for old Shipper imbalances and cleans up all of Dynegy.  Thanks Lynn 
 Ricki, the imbalance meeting will be at 3:30 on Mondays in 1336.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Yes, I am available.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, I am available to meet through lunch.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, I have you on my calendar for 9:00 Friday.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at "small customer delivery points" on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we would at least  throw them on the table.  1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is today.  2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.  3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes even though they are in the field area?  4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point? I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.  We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn 
  We rely on the information from the Process Responsibility meeting to post weekend coverage to the WEB.  The coverage is posted by Tuesday morning on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers.  Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting. You should have the right information going into Monday's meeting.  It does not look good to continually repost this information.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?  Looks like I am going unless cost is ridiculous.  Attached is the hotel I would stay in for Wed. night and possibly Thursday night, depending on what you find out with flights. Let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Attached is the supplemental PAA form that needs to be filled out with the form Shelley sent.    Thanks. Lynn 
  Terry and John, is there a master list that we all use for the phoneburst we send out?  If so, who keeps it updated?  Thanks. Lynn 
  Michelle said the Third Party Storage Tariff sheet is #304.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, the other question Michelle had, "Does NNG Contracts have a written procedure for approval of this type of contract?  Please check with Linda Trevino.  We are to meet with Michelle at 10:30 Friday morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, do you keep track of the Phoneburst list?  Let's discuss in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry and Richard, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, have you been keeping track of  the people responding to the invitation? Thanks. Lynn 
 I think there intent was to be very general.  You have the right sheet.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jodie, when you have time let's discuss.  Overall I am OK with plan, but had a question about who was monitoring imbalances.  Sounds like Marketing is instead of Gas Logistics?  Thanks. Lynn 
 So is there nothing for us to do?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, FYI.  Thought you might want for Monday's staff meeting  Donna, you may want to incorporate some of this in the weekly bullets.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, are all our questions answered?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, I'll bring you both checks tonight when I get home. Thanks for the reminder.  Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please schedule a meeting with all of the above people.  Thanks. Lynn

 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Mary and Steve, here is a high level recap of the presentation I am giving Marketing on Tuesday.  I would appreciate any thoughts or concerns you may have.     Maybe we can discuss at the 1:30 meeting Monday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, wanted to pass this on to you.  Mike and I just talked about this and we are going to work with Richard and Reyna to be sure this cannot happen in the future.  (One of those surprises we were talking about earlier today).  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, fyi for scheduling this meeting.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you both in thel oop on some Oneok issues.  Thanks. Lynn

  Ava, we need to meet first thing Monday to see where you are on the Agenda for Tuesday's meeting plus I need this presentation in power point Mondy morning as well.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please coordinate with Alma a time Rick, Larry and I can talk about the flowing gas documents no accessible to customers.  Thanks. Lynn 
  On NNG and TW we had a quiet weekend.  Sunday's Gas Day  - Drafted 60,000 mmcf/d  Monday - No draft  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, one more comment:  Pinnacle Terry is the only point shutin due to the ElPaso nitrogen issue.  John, Penny and Darrell are monitoring the situation.  John and Penny are working with legal and regulatory on a letter to be posted to the WEB.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Steve, there are no changes from last heating season.  We are just trying to refresh everyone's memor as to the current procedures.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
   Jo,  At Pinnacle Terry  there is only one shipper - Tristar Gas Marketing for 800 dth  At Elpaso Keystone as of today Reliant is the only shipper for 14,000 dth.  Is that the info you are looking for?  Thanks. Lynn

 I want to get together and discuss this before we call Dari or Rita. Ava, please set up a time on Wednesday or Thursday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sorry, here is the attachment.  Ignore previous email.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Ava, please add the following as the second bullet   OFO/PRIMARY FIRM REQUIREMENTS  Can NNG call shippers back to primary firm receipt points? 
  Steve and Mary, here is a seperate Agenda item for us to discuss at 1:30.  Thanks. Lynn  OFO/PRIMARY FIRM REQUIREMENTS  Can NNG call shippers back to primary firm receipt points?   Answer:  Carlton is the only authorized OFO point NNG has on their system which we have done with the 250 at Carlton  We do not have this authority at all other points 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, are you going to wait for input before sending this to Michelle?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, did you ever get a response on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Have you heard any rumbles about Sheila's note?  Please let her know if you have.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jean, I would like to order the BlackBerry.  My ID No. is 10028029.  Thanks. Lynn 
 test 
  Hope this gets to you.  Look forward to seeing you this evening.  Lynn 
  I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that we need to discuss in the morning.  1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing 2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator calculation. (as well as fuel) 3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts.  Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Well, I wonder if you got my first message?  Here is the second one as  you requested.  Hope your day is going well.  See ya tonight.  Lynn 
 I am fine with your explanation as well.  Is anyone complaining about only one person being able to view the info?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Bob, I will be out of the office on Monday, Oct. 22nd., but Donna and John can work with Williams and the team to meet on MOPS scheduling.  I would like for you to meet with Donna and John before the 22nd to be sure we are comfortable with what information to pass back and forth.  John, would you take the lead working with Donna and Bob to cover the meeting on Monday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Hey, I got your message and you can flirt with me any time.  Lynn 
 Tom, we would be glad to do a timeline review.  I will be out of town until next Wednesday.  John, would you please give Tom a call and work with Ava to set up a time for us to review. Tom, did a "brown bag" session work for you guys from 11:30 to 1:00?  If so, we can go that route again.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sounds like we are getting quite a bit more feed back.  We better re-group first thing in the morning.  Is everyone available at 8:30?  Thanks. Lynn 
 I think it would be very prudent to put something on the WEB.  We talked about this at the Winter Ops meeting and it would be good to have another reminder.  John, would you work with Michelle and Bill to get a posting on the WEB since I will be out of town.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta and Larry, is there anything special we can do now to make January's re-bill easier? Thanks. Lynn 
  Test - Looking forward to seeing you tonight.  Lynn 
  Here is your second email.  See ya tonight!!  Lynn 
 We can make the meeting Thursday afternoon if that is better for you guys.  It will be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss.   Rick, FYI, Shelley postponed her meeting until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting.  Possible means they do not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wanted to give us a "heads up" from a system perspective.  Hopefully that helps.  See ya'll in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Donna, here is one we did for Raetta.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Here are two we did for Harry and Tangie.  Thanks. Lynn 
  How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?  Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.  We can discuss when I get back next week.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name is on the list. Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the list and added the new people.  Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Here is a first pass at the customer letter.  Probably needs some work on more detail.    Thanks. Lynn

 Please ensure the billing is done to reflect the balancing days we called.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shelley, FYI.  Just to let you know our practice.  John and/or Terry issue procedures in the attached format for any new service NNG or TW provides.  They also meet with the teams to review the procedures and make sure all parties are up to speed.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ray, Teb is right..  Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices on June 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively capture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.  Hope I have not confused the issue for you. If you have any other questions, please let me know Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, here is the correct spelling of the two names we talked about today in= the team leader meeting.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tammy, let's go forward with this training.  Is there anything else you need from us?  Thanks. Lynn

 Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as meeting you.  I wanted to let you know ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.  Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.  Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a cancellation.  One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the "mis matches" across interconnecting pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for the Enron pipes and I wold like to know if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.  If you would like to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.  Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, please set up the following meeting:  Topic - TW Imbalance management  Attendees:  Darrel Schoolcraft Richard Hanigriff Steven January TK Lohman Sue Neville Lynn Blair Kim Watson  CC:  Rick Dietz  Thanks. Lynn

 Larry, let's discuss in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn 
 I appreciate your input.  All the other teams voted for meeting at 2:00 p.m in the afternoon.  So that is probably what we will go with.  Thanks.  Lynn 
 Sherry, where was Jean?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jodie, did you ever meet with John?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Dale, does this help any?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jamie, FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tery, what did we do on this?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Wasn't sure if I had sent this to you.,  Thanks. Lynn 
 Larry and raetta, cand we make sure we do not bill for the vented gas.  Can we work with measurement and redcue the actuals by the 8,000 to 10,000?  Steve, does anyone have the exact volume vented?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Gary is right.  But if NGTS is the only contract, they will take the swing.= Or is Pioneer saying they want to take the swing?  If Pioneer wants to do the swing, maybe they could= do a contract to cover the swing volume only?  Karen and Larry, what do you think?  Thanks. = Lynn 
 Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the morning meeting:  The report is completed for all information except:  Storage Operational Capacity Current and Accum Imbalances  The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not giving up on possibilities.  As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will change once the new report is completed.  Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to ensure we get the product we need.  If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tracy, we have already given the plaques to the employees, but I think they would like the case as well.  So go ahead and send them to me and I will give them to the employees.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, what kind of calendars do you have?  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Tangie, very good letter.  I am assuming this does not include the PVR OBA, but all others. Is that a right assumption?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, what are your thoughts on these enhancements?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Anna, at this time we have no openings available on the Gas Logistic Teams. Please do not hesitate to equire at any time and also watch the EBB for any postings. Thanks. Lynn

 Mary, you probably saw this, but thought you might find it interesting.  Thank.s Lynn 
 Thanks. Lynn 
 Nancy, I can go either way.  If you guys want to meet and then I can catch up with Donna that is fine.  I just wanted to be sure we got you the answers you needed.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Amy, are they paying for all the expenses except air fare?  If so, go ahead and plan on attending.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Alma, how is this for Diana?  Is that enough?  Please call me if you need more.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Donna, did you and Shelley have any more discussion on the move and getting a letter to the reps?  I would like to send something out to them.  There are a lot of questions. Thanks. Lynn 
 Please read the note below and let's all make an effort to ensure Omaha can hear us in the Morning Meeting.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Diana is very much a team player and ensures all the team members' accounts are billed accurately each month.   Diana is a very positive influence on her team. She is the first one to bring resolution to the table on any reconciliation that needs to be done on team issues as well as business issues.  Accomplishments -  Diana was nominated and selected for the Chairman's Award.  Alma, hopefully this helps.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Raetta, were these valid?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Steve, this is going to possible make a difference in how much gets scheduled at Socal.  So you may see a little lower numbers at time.  Let's discuss if that does not make sense.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Larry and Raetta, are we covered on the billing?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Since I missed part of the meeting Friday, what was the to do on this topic?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Estallee, how do we handle this?  Throught the PRC or seperately?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jerr, have you seen this letter?  Wanted to keep you in the loop.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Sheila, FYI.  I had Hilda pull this info together for me when we were justifying moving reservation billing by one day.  This will need to be talked about for July billing of June production.  Thanks. Lynn 
  FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, what is the status of setting up the follow up meeting for those that = did not attend? Frazier King can tell you when they will have the tape.  Let's be sure to s= et this up by the end of June if possible.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ricki, no problem.  Let's also book 4194 for the day and I will talk to the three people that have meetings in 4194 to let them know they could use my office.   Are you OK with that?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ricki, I have talked with all the parties that have meetings on June 11 in 4194.  They will use my office if we have to bump them.  Thanks.  Lynn 
 FYI.  We are accumulating the requests and will meet at a later date to determine if we add any points.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Jean, I believe everyone received the same message.  The only response is if you fit the criteria below.  I am assuming you do not.  Please let me know if we need to discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 John, what is the status of the agreement with UCU at the Sunflower point?  Are you still waiting to hear from Karen?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Alma, hope this helps.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Terry, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Scott, per our conversation this afternoon, I wanted to follow up with this email.  We would appreicate help in ensuring NO ONE works on Gary Spraggins machine on the weekend.  For the last several weekends, he has come in on Monday mornings and cannot log into the system.  Gary and Darrell Schoolcraft are on NT while the rest of this floor (41) are on Windows 95.  If you need more explanation, please call Dale Ratliff or Steve January.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Per Terry's comments, we have the "blocks" in the system to prevent any shipper from going to 16A back into the "Bushton Universe".  As long as that block is in place, we are OK with Duke using 16A for pooling purposes. Hopefully this answers your question.  If not let me know.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Wanted to be sure you were both in the loop that we are NOT posting Shipper imbalances to the Web, only OBA Dollar Valued agreements.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  This was decided after a meeting this morning with Shelley and Teb to review TW tariff and compliance.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Lindy, I will be out of the office that week.  But Terry Kowalke will set in for me. Thanks. Lynn 
 Attached is the agenda for the TW Imbalance meeting on:  Tuesday, June 12, 2001 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. EB4102    If you have any additions to this agenda, please let Ava know.  She will add the additions and resend the agenda.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Shane, Sheila is in Arkansas.  She is doing a lot better.  Her "tingling in her arm and leg acted up again.  Hopefully she will be home this weekend.  I'll let you know when we hear something for sure.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Since I am out of the office Friday, would you please work with Donna on the bullets we want in Shelley's weekly report.  Thanks. Lynn

 It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully) surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital (Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.  I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that. Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with his Mom.  Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.  As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.  Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn 
 FYI.  Just to keep you in the loop.   John, will you verify with Charlie that Rick Kile and Ronnie have the lead on this and that he is not waiting on us for anything.  Thanks. Lynn 
  I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.  There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an assumption everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was still a lot of vacation to be taken.  I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00 to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year.  We can meet in my office.  Thanks. Lynn 
 FYI.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava and John, please let me know if we are not going to have this info by Tuesday.  THanks. Lynn 
 An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with storage and determine what changes need to be made.  One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report and the automation of the storage report.  Let's discuss on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Richard, what is the status of this issue?  Thanks. Lynn 
 Ava, let's go ahead with this day and time.  I will cover for John.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Mary, we would love to have you come.  Thanks. Lynn 
 Randy, thanks for your prompt reply.  Lynn 
 Galen's home address is as follows.  Several people had asked for it to send cards.  I am sure he would appreicate the thoughts and prayers.  Home Address 10622 Endicott Lane Houston, TX  77318   Thanks. Lynn

  Shelley, we had our weekly TW imbalance meeting this morning and I think you will be very pleased next week to see the progress the team has made.  They have come up with plans for both the dollar valued and volumetric imbalances.  We have ensured the volumetric imbalances have not grown this last week and will continue this effort.  TK, Darrell and Dan are bringing suggestions to the table to look at the economics of what the customers are doing.   We will continue to monitor throughout this week and weekend and be ready for an update on Tuesday.  Hope you both are having a great vacation.  See ya next week.  Lynn

 Ricki, are you planning on Ava covering for you next week when she gets back? Or is Alma covering for you? Thanks. Lynn

Lynn 
 Sorry for the change.  But the below referenced meeting has been re-scheduled for:  Wednesday, July 11 at 3:00 p.m. in EB4102  Thanks.  Lynn 
 Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper. Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters as we go through the billing process. Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn 
 It's a surprise!!!!!!!!!!! - We had a choice of 2 different sizes and Ava is checking on some info for us.  Thanks. lynn 
 Mike, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file Jeff sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded). I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up. 
  Here is our first draft. 
  Tammy, thanks for the update.  Please keep me posted if we are not going to meet Wed. dead line.  Thanks. Lynn 
  Ranelle, I have a meeting Tuesday afternoon from 2:30 - 3;30 and Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. Otherwise I am available on those two afternoons.  I would like for John Buchanan and Terry Kowalke to be included on this discussion.  Thanks for getting this meeting set up.  Lynn
