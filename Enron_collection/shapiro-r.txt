 The Following are our  recommended changes to the agreement( I would also like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):  Page 2, item (3) should read "The payment of a "project fee" of $175,000 upon the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.  Item (4) should read "The payment of a "project fee" equal to 2% of the project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in Exhibit B to this letter.  Exhibit A should read as follows:  Individual milestones subject to "project fee" payments:  1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. ("Haywood Power"), the abandonment by the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of its Haywood County, Tennessee facility ("Lagoon Creek"), which results in Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement.  2.

Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Calvert.  Exhibit B should read as follows:  The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a "Development Project"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any Development Project.
