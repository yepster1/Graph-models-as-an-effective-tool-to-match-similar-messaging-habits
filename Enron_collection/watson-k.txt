 I have another meeting from 2:00 - 3:00pm.  I would only be available for the first 30 minutes. 
 TK, since you, Steve and I are traveling tomorrow, could you work with Lynn to schedule this meeting for Wednesday.  You, for sure, need to be there.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks, Audrey!  Kim. 
 Steve,  While I am checking on this items we discussed, here is a draft copy of both proposals.  Please note that I have given them 60 days to respond.  That may be too long for the Red Rock proposal.  Let me know if you would like one or both timeframes changed.  I'll visit with you by voice mail as I get an answer from Dennis Tu.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks for letting me know.  I'm glad you have everything back.  How are you doing?  K. 
 I'm in ECN1346.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks for the chuckle! Kim. 
 Ron, here it is.  Thanks, Kim.

 Lee,  Here is the Agave I/C agreement.  I made a few changes.  Please review:  Para 1:  Agave....a New Mexico corporation... Article 2.1:  term of ...five (5) years Article 3.3:  New paragraph.  Please wordsmith as necessary.  Also, notice the weird indentation on 3.1 and 3.2.  Can you help this? Article 8.5:  filled in detail on Agave contacts as per their request.  Let me know.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kevin,  We can meet at 3:00pm in EB1336.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hi Kirk,  I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me know if we can do anything for you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thanks Lindy.  Have a good time in sunny California!  K. 
 This is a sweet note.  Let me know what he says.  K. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Lee,  Please look this over.  This is the Questar I/C agreement for the east leg of the Southern Trails Leg.  Let me know if I can send it out.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Lorraine,  Here are the proposals that we sent to SW Gas last week.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  FYI, Kirk did not have good news on the approval for Big Sandy yesterday, but it looks like they have Plan B moving forward.  I will stay in touch with Kirk and keep you posted.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Kirk,  Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.  Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.  Thanks for keeping me posted, Kim. 
 Ron, FYI, Kim. 
 Thanks!  This is great news!  K. 
 Steve and Teb,  Please find attached the agreement for Questar Southern Trails I/C with TW in the San Juan Hub.  It is very standard, just like the Agave agreement.  Fully reimbuseable.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks, Kim. X33098 
 Larry,  Please take a look at this spreadsheet.  I welcome and encourage any and all comments you may have on this.  Please feel free to make changes my wording as well as the spreadsheet itself.  As we move this forward, I will want to attach a current version of your NYMEX Technical Update.  Many, many thanks for all of your help and support on this matter!  Kim. 
 Blair, per my voice mail message.  If you can, would you please review and let me know if you have any comments.  It is a very standard, fully reimusable I/C.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Dear Gaylen and Jodi,  Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San Juan area.  The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.  This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.  Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks,  Kim.     P.S.   I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.  I will send it under separate cover. 
 Dear Gaylen and Jodi,  I was having technical difficulty in sending this drawing with the I/C agreement.  Here it is.  Please let us know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes, I will wait for you.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I wanted to send a note to let everyone know that the rate for the firm transportation agreement with Agave (K#26490 & #26606) increases by $0.01 for all volumes west and east effective November 1, 2001 through October 31, 2003 as follows:   New Rate For West Flow volumes of 70,000 MMBtu/d - $0.15 (#26490) For East Flow volumes of 40,000 MMBtu/d - $0.07  (#26606)  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.  Thanks,  Kim   X33098 
 Glen,  Interesting reading from one of our customers. Kim. 
 Glen,  This is very interesting reading.  Please read this (sorry, it's kind of long) and let me know if it meshes with what you think is happening in California.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Larry, here is draft #2.  Again, many thanks!  K. 
 Lorraine,  When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.  I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.  We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.  Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jean,  all is correct except that Steve Harris should get two flat screens instead of Michelle and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for Michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  Many thanks, Kim 
 FYI, Kim. 
 I do not believe that I am familiar with this company.  Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 Jo,  Here is a copy of the open season that is being posted late today for a TW expansion from San Juan to Phoenix and California.

 Thank you, Audrey.  By the way, the marketing team is off campus tomorrow in a strategy session with Facility Planning.  Call me on the cell phone if you need me or anyone else on the team. (713 416 5059).  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jerry,  Unfortunately, our marketing department is off campus tomorrow with are Fac= ility Planning group and will be unable to attend.  We will catch you next = month.=20  Thanks, Kim.=20 
 Kay,  Thanks for the update.  Actually, I did not realize that Jeff's computer had Prophet X on it.  I would like to get together with you in the next few days and discuss the software package with you.  We may indeed wish to keep a user on it but I would like to understand it better.  I'm out of the office tomorrow, but will be back in on Thursday.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Paul,  Just in case we need bigger translations, see below.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thank you, Randy.  Kim. 
 Lee and Denise,  FYI, Kim. 
 Steve, FYI.  Kim. 
 Thanks for the future dates.  I'll try not to schedule any more conflicts w= ith this time......    :>).    Kim. 
 I'll will try to have them by 4:00pm.  Thanks, Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 You bet!  Can we meet at 11:20 or 11:30?  I would like to be back for a 1:00 pm meeting.  Have you been to Daily Review Cafe lately?  It is just outside of Downtown off of Dallas St.  I would be happy to drive.  Thanks, Kim. 
 How about we meet you at the Met.  Lindy and I will be in the 3AC until lunch.  Meet you there at 11:30. \ Thanks, Kim.

 John and Sean,  Attached, please find the Transwestern Sun Devil Open Season Document.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.  John, it was great talking with you again.  Thanks, Kim Watson (713) 853-3098 
 FYI, I think this was originally sent to me from Paul.  It looks like it is a 13 hr. drive from Palermo to Florence.  Kim. 
 FYI, Kim. 
 you bet!  How about Wed. August 15?  Kim. 
 Dot,  I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim. 
 5,000 for Cal 02 hedged at $3.46.  Kim.  (Theresa executed for us) 
 Sorry, my earlier email message to you failed and returned to me.  We transacted 5,000 EP Permian at $3.46 for Cal 02.  Kim. 
 Kirk,  Here is the open season document on our Sun Devil Expansion Project.  Have a great weekend!  Kim. 
 I think she is on vacation most of next week.  Is it possible to talk with Julie or the other assistants to figure out the costs just to have a ball park place holder until Linda comes back?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jean,  This does not look cool.  Who should I report this to?  How did these people get my email address?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I think so, but how can I tell? 
 Dan,  Here is the Sun Devil Expansion Project information.  Please review and give me a call at your convience to discuss.  We also have some space left from our Red Rock Expansion that we can discuss as well.  Thank you for your interest and I look forward to working with you.  Kim Watson 713 853-3098

 We are tracking this one down.  I'll keep you posted.  Kim. 
 Steve,  Do you want Audrey to have one or two flat screens on her desk?  Kim. 
 Gary,  I just wanted to get back with you on the Salt Dome Storage question you asked earlier.  I have not been able to find anyone in TW who has knowledge of exploring it, but per Kevin's recent message, it looks like SWG is beginning to pursue it.  Do you have any comments or thoughts?  I will be in Omaha on Thursday of this week for a RM meeting, maybe we can hook up for a few minutes and visit about this.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Thank you!  Kim.  :>) 
 Amy,  Here is the Open Season Document on our Sun Devil Expansion.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I've got it!  Kim.

Steve and I are hoping to connect up with Danny tomorrow afternoon and discuss both our fuel strategy and our Index to Index Deal strategy.  I have put together some numbers on the I to I deals, but I would like to discuss them with you to make sure I am not missing anything.  Although Larry Pavlou is on vacation tomorrow, he will be conferenced into our meeting.  You are also welcome to join our meeting if you are available.  I believe that we are meeting at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.

 J, you are too funny!  I am always entertained by the wonderful way in which you express yourself in these emails.  You make me laugh.  ILY, HA!  K. 
 John,  I will be travelling on Wednesday with Mansoor to see Questar and Agave and will not be in the office to attend this meeting.  I would like to ask Lorraine Lindberg to be involved in this meeting in my absence.  Lorraine, would you be available to attend this meeting for our team regarding capacity on the mainline?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Susan, thank you for the invite, but I will be travelling on Wednesday and will not be able to attend.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Morgan, I am on the road on Tues and Wed back on Thursday.  I would love to see everyone's handy work if people can wait that long.  Otherwise, can you keep it in your office until I return?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Miranda,  Will it be possible to reschedule my time for this training?  I just learned that I will be out of town on Wednesday.  Do you have any time next week available?  I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.  Thank you,  Kim Watson. X33098 
 Pilar and Martha,  I am sorry I will be unable to attend.  I do not return to town until Wed. evening.  Thanks, Kim. 
 John,  Hi, I got your voice mail while I was out of town.  I am out of town tomorrow, but I am coming to Omaha on Wed eve. and will be in the office on Thursday.  Can we talk for a while on Thursday afternoon to discuss USGT?  Thanks, Kim.

 Jan,  Thank you for keeping this up to date!  Kim. 
 Yes, I will need everyone's passport for possible reservations on a ferry.  Thanks, Kim.

 Rich,  Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this unit.  Kim. 
 Audrey, I added one more bullet from the earlier version I sent you.  Please work from this one.  Michelle, please fill in the appropriate volume amount for the volume affected on the Gallup compressor outtage.  Also, per my voicemail to you, please check with Palu on the highlighted blue bullets to confirm that your two bullets are not already included in the numbers that Jan gave me on her bullet.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey,  email from home works differently than the office.  I hope this attaches this time.  Sorry.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I got it....Kim Watson 
 Theresa,  FYI, Let's talk on Wednesday.  I'm in Dallas tomorrow.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I have a tentative Spires Board meeting.  I should know in the next week or so if that is a firm date.  If it is not, then I would love to be at Perry's with you.  ILY, K. 
 I probably prefer the 3 or 17.  Let's get the rest of our invites together this weekend.  ILY, K. 
 Steve,=20  Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned o= utage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on = Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that = we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead= with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other = SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down= the lateral while Burlington is down. =20  Thanks, Kim.  =20  =20 
 I love this report.  How often will you send this out?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Jan, FYI, on remaining outages for 2001.  Thanks, Kim. 
 What do I need to do with this?  Should we be talking to our customers?  Are we all in agreement as to our position?   I just want to make sure that I'm not letting anything slip through the crack.  Thanks, Kim. 
 How was this meeting?  Any additional capacity identified?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Michelle,  Did everything get paid?  Is all resolved?  Thanks, Kim. 
 I was informed by Lone Star that they have not completed their transaction with Sid Richardson and they will continue to take deliveries from TW until further notice.  (I suspect that they may not sell this asset, after all.)  Assume no sale for now, I will keep you posted if anything changes.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Dan,  I do not understand what this message means.  Please advise.  Kim. 
 Yes, I will attend.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Michelle,  Any luck helping Debbie with this?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Audrey, one more name in addition to the ones I've already given you.... please add Elizabeth Brown on the invite list.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Tiny,  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to come to Houston to attend this.  TW is assured the best success when all key departments are part of the strategy.  I have always appreciated your input and your enthusiasm for success.  Thanks, Kim. 
 I would like to attend the 10/31 session.  Will the training be in the morning?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Mary, I got your voicemail last week.  I am so glad you guys had a great time.  John and I leave for Italy at the end of the month for two weeks.  I am very ready........Will you be coming to Houston this fall?  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve and Dave,  As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about= what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index = deals.  Here are my thoughts...  For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San = Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 c= ould impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for t= his transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi= ll have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approxima= tely 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over co= llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have so= mething less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio= n.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assum= e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 = MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5= ,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that = we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seaso= nally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The rema= ining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to= provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. =20  It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d o= f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where = Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually bu= rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers= who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind f= uel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actu= ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not ha= ve additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not= have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity los= s on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on= their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that= we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provide= d by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this part= icular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash p= rices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a pri= ce that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunit= y loss. =20  Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agre= e that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow? =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 Rich,  Can you help us in defining how we can participate in the Laguna festival?  Steve, TK and I are available to participate on Tuesday, Sept. 18.  We would have to be able to leave Albuquerque around the noon hour on Wednesday, Sept. 19.  Thanks, Kim. 
 pricing are falling more.....Cal 02 is now $3.27.  EOL still does not have Perm Basis posted for Cal 02, but we suspect that it is in the $.11-.14 range.  FYI. 
 In talking with Larry and Morgan, it is a belief that there will be people covering short positions by tomorrow or Wed before the close of Sept. contracts and AGA on Wed, we could see a pop back up in the next 48....Shall we watch it?  Kim 
 In talking with Larry and Morgan, it is a belief that there will be people covering short positions by tomorrow or Wed before the close of Sept. contracts and AGA on Wed, we could see a pop back up in the next 48....Shall we just watch it?  Kim 
 Gerry,  Lindy and I are going to tag team on this.  She and I will get together on the results of these meetings.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Michelle, please respond to Ava if you would like to attend.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yikes, another message.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Hey guys and girls,  Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of t= he trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking= for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from= the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it i= s a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the art= icle in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our H= otel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 4= 30,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we w= on't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which g= ives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with = jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancel= lation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says t= hey have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cance= llation with our reservation. =20  I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the o= thers, if at all.=20  Please let me know your thoughts ASAP. =20  Thanks, Kim. 
 11:30 in the lobby sounds fine.  I would be happy to drive.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Yes, I will be there.  Thanks, Kim. 
 John,  I will be able to make the Thursday meeting.  I will be out of the office on Friday afternoon.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,   FYI, prices this morning are still hanging in the $3.10-3.13 range for Permian Cal 02.  We are watching it closely.  I'll keep you posted if it starts to rally back up.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  We have a contract extension for Sempra, 30,000/d from La Plata to I/B Link extending it from 12/31/01 to 12/31/02.  Max rate.  Standard language.  I would like to approve this contract in your absence.  Legal and Regulatory have already approved.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Rich,  My fax number is 713 646-4095.  Thanks, Kim  Will you be there, also? 
 I will approve Sempra deal.  Danny is out of the office today, but he will be in tomorrow.  I'll still keep you posted on prices if they begin to move.  Thanks, Kim. 
 J, D, P and J,  Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car).  FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.  Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.  Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.  I will keep you posted as we hear more.  Thanks, Kim. 
 John, FYI, I'll let you know when I hear from her.  Thanks, Kim. 
 Steve,  James ran numbers.  $.22 for 10 yr. for 43,300/d is a DCF of 16.57% with no resubscriptions.  This looks better than any of the 5 year cases on either a 120/d case or 150/d case.  Thoughts?  We have not approached Duke with a 10 yr term yet.  Thanks, Kim and Michelle 
 Audrey,  Would you please set up a meeting for me on Wednesday (tomorrow) to discuss the Griffith plant and some of the problems we have been having lately with respect to TW's responsibilities, EAMR's responsibilities and Trigon's responsibilities.  (Please share this meeting purpose in the email notice of this meeting.)  We would like to meet from 3:00 to 4:00 pm, we need a conference room in Houston with the ability to conference in several other locations.  In addition to the names below, please include Don Hawkins, Sarabeth Smith, Donna Scott, Dennis Alters, Darrell Schoolcraft and me.  Many thanks,  Kim :>) 
 Are you online?  MSN shows you not logged in.  BTW, my car is ready.  I will pick it up tonight.  It was the starter.  $550 (includes a new battery).  FYI, ILY, K.  PS.  I will keep you posted on the ferry poll.  I still vote for arriving in Lucca earlier in the day, only because if we don't arrive untill evening, then we will spend the whole next day in Lucca instead of getting to Florence.  I'm tryi
