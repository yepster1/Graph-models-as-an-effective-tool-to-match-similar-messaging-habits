 Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?! 
 EOG interconnect is finishing this week and will be in service by this weekend.  It will initially flow 8-10000/day and will increase to over 15000.

 Documentation for the Southern to BP Energy contract assignments. 
 Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25. They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.

 Great Expectations Forbes - 10/16/2000 BY Lynn Cook Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.  ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.  The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover.  Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet connections to its iPAQ Pocket. 
 Of course...Tuesday it is! 
 How are you?  I was just thinking of you guys and wanted to say "hi"!!! 
 Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!! Yes, let's allget together soon...call me!  Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one? 
 Count me in. 
 Additional name for Conoco.

 Vacation week of July 31- August 4.  Jury Duty on August 14.  Thanks. 
 Sure, let's talk. 
 Hi Mike,  Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!  How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much shorter!  Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?! 
 Good. 
 Count me in, if still available.  Thanks! 
 Would love to attend, but I will be out on vacation.  Can I have a copy of any notes that are taken? 
 Miss you guys too!  Thanks for asking about Meghan....she's going to be 2 next month (where has all the time gone?)!  It sounds like you're having a terrific time too.  Been to Disney again?  Let's talk soon and thing about me when you guys go to Zios!!! 
 Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan and I are going to be on vacation in California.  Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs! 
 What do you think?  If we forward this, I think this needs to be cleaned up. 
 Got them.  They're beautiful...thanks! 
 Please approve. 
 I was out the afternoon of Tuesday, November 28.  Thanks. 
 How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in Interfirst Plaza? 
 Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out otherwise, let me know!  Thanks.     Ginger McCain                06/30/2000 09:56 AM 
 The numbers look good!

 Revenue Generating: Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at max tariff rate for California deliveries; generating $2.7 million in revenue.  Included was a sharing mechanism providing an opportunity to generate market based transport. Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 35,000/day of supply on east end of system. Executed pooling agreement with Cima Energy to become a new customer on Transwestern, providing 5-10,000/day of incremental supply on TW's system.  Non-Revenue: Settled dispute with Burlington that could have cost $3 million dollars; negotiated potential damages down to $100,000 and eliminating future potential dollar exposure.
