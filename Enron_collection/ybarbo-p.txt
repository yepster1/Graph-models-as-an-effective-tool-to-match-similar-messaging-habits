 Gary,  Please resend the above report to me on April 12th. I am travelling and the size of the report is giving me difficulties replicating my e-mail.  Thanks,  Paul 
 Harib,  Attached is the latest update for the DPC project. A printed copy of project photos is being forwarded to you seperately. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713 345-5855.  Best Regards,  Paul 
  Audrey,  All of my time was normal time.  Thanks,  Paul 
  Walt,  EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas.  Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?  Thanks,  Paul 
  Perry,  Walt is saying the field would just tap the line and install a block valve. Can you talk to Sammie Williams and make sure that you both agree regarding the EFM.  Thanks,  Paul 
  Susan,  Thank you for your bid for transportation capacity on Transwestern. We are in the process of evaluating your proposal. I will call you on Monday before noon.  I hope your weekend is great!  Paul 
  FYI - see attached 
  This meeting will provide an update on the work that I have been doing regarding Price Spreads and Available Capacity in the future.  Paul 
  Kim & Lindy,  TK and I may be calling one or both of you to get this posted this week. I can be reached on my cellular at 713 825-8046.  Paul 
 Rajesh,  Clay and Wayne and I talked today and agreed that Conditions of Use agreements for Dabhol, Oman, and possibly Abu Dhabi would be a good starting point. Let's talk with Clay tomorrow morning Houston time. Are you in the Enron office in Dubai?  Paul 
  per your request 
  Elizabeth,  The original delivery points for these contracts were:  25841		40,000/d to Topock  26511		21,000/d to Needles   TK tells me that now the delivery points are:  25841		29,000/d to Topock 11,000/d to Needles  26511		11,000/d to Topock 10,000/d to Needles  Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?  Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?  I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.  Many Thanks,  Paul 
  Steve,  Per my note, the attached is electronic form of data requested.  Paul 
 Barbara,  I noticed the same thing and asked Laura to investigate. I am out of the office but will return on Monday. We'll straighten it out then.  Talk to you soon,  Paul 
  TK,  FYI 
  Please have a look at this and see if you spot anything that needs to be added. I'd like to add our gas quality specs and equipment specs mentioned in Sect. 3.3.  Next I want to circulate to engineering and operations for comment.  Thanks,  Paul 
 Audrey,  I only had regular time.  Thanks,  Paul 
 Javier,  Do you know anyone that might be interested in this?  Paul 
 Edan,  Thanks!!!! I didn't realize that you were still in Hong Kong. How's life??? Are you married? I can't remember.  Married life is good. Different but good.  Paul 
  FYI 
  Maggie,  Attached is my completed security request form for access to TW's CAS.  Thanks,  Paul 
 Barbara,  Transwestern Pipeline Company consents to disclosure of the discount rate for FTS-1 Agreement No. 27606 to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. For our files, please FAX a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement between PNM and the NMPRC to me at (713) 646-4095.  Thanks,  Paul Y'Barbo 
  Scott,  See the attached document.  I do not propose any language at this time to cover the eventuality of Children (except for what is in the Will). Any changes that would be needed to my beneficiary designations for the two Brown & Company accounts and the Enron insurance benefits will simply be made as and when needed.  Thanks,  Paul 
  Perry,  Please review attached document and let's discuss. You can make revisions to this document and return to me.  Thanks,  Paul 
 Alton,  Thanks for the concern. Fortunately, I transferred to one of Enron's pipeline companies in mid-September (just before things started getting really crazy). This is the most stable part of the company and we will survive no matter what ... although we may be owned by someone other than Enron. I was also fortunate to have very little Enron stock exposure. Many of my friends have not been so fortunate. They are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth.  Andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also. I don't understand how they could have allowed Enron to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet.  Are you all going to Port Neches for Thanksgiving? Renee and I are going tonight. I hope that you all have a very nice Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Many Happy Returns,  Paul 
  Lorraine,  Laura has re-invoiced PNM and we should be in agreement now.  Thanks,  Paul 
  Suzanne,  Final pricing for the subject cargo is dependent on Nov-Jan LPG prices. A provisional amount is due today. Please base the provisional amount on a Nov MB price of 35-cents, Dec and Jan MB prices of 32.5-cents. These prices reflect the current market.  Thanks,  Paul
