 FYI  Vince 
 Call John Martin Sat 3:00 p.m. 
 Alex,  No problem.  Vince 
 Osman,  George  Posey asked for a call.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please put it on my calendar.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, set up a phone interview with him. I think both Zimin and Stinson should talk to him.  Vince 
 Pavel,  We shall talk to him. He looks like a very qualified candidate.  Vince 
 I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.  I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston.  The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.  Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.   Vince Kaminski 
 Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the code.  Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points.  1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. It's not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the "research projects" and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just Tanya's issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince 
 Christie,  I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and Rice projects. By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is exactly the same as the project for Wharton. We shall see who is better.  Their names are Li Sun  and Kenneth Parkhill. Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings on Friday?  Vince 
 Martin,  Please, ask Steve to call your office. I may be late on Friday. I don't have to be present at this conference call. Please, talk about your potential involvement and if takes a trip to London it's OK with me.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Do you know anything about it?  Vince 
 Ed,  No problem. Please, forward me her resume.  Vince 
 Peter,  I forwarded your resume with my recommendation to two senior executives in our Transportation and Storage Group.  Vince 
 Molly,  Sandeep Kohli called last night.  We decided to transfer Anshuman for the 6-month trial period and then extend his assignment to a permanent employment if necessary. For Sandeep Kohli it's a permanent transfer, effective immediately.  Some local opposition to poaching of good people.   Vince 
 Hi Jeff,  No problem.  As soon as we have an agreement in place, I shall start working with you.  Vince 
 Zimin,  Can you interview this guy? Maybe Tanya, a math Ph.D. can help as well.   Vince 
 Christie,  Thanks for the invitation. I shall see you on Friday.   Vince 
 Steve,  It's really Houston part of the group only. We have to figure out how to close the gap caused by Grant's departure.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Can we give access to her and WHY?   Vince 
 Anne,  Thanks. Shirley is checking my calendar and will call you about the schedule. The entire week of the 11th does not look good for me.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince   P.S.  Rita, Please, cc Shirley on all my msgs.   Vince 
 Shirley,  It's OK.  Vince 
 Hi, Christe  Thanks. The objective of the meeting with Jeff Shankman is to use his powers of persuasion to make sure that John Arnold and Louise Kitchen can make   presentations to the Tiger Team. We can also talk to them  about getting some other people from their units to make presentations to the team.   Vince 
 Jeff,  Please, send me your phone numbers. I shall call you at my convenience.  Vince 
 Shirley,  FYI  Vince 
 Donna,  My preference is to come to the campus. I shall check with Christie and Jeff regarding their availability.  Vince 
 Steve,  Friday morning is fine. What about 8:00 a.m.?  Vince 
 Denise,  No problem. We shall prepare a short presentation to address these issues.  Vince Kaminski 
 Dennis,  Thanks for you message. I shall send you more information regarding the dinner later this week. Christie Patrick, who is in charge of our university liaison unit, is making arrangements for the evening  at the Enron Field. Hopefully, we shall be able to combine dinner with a game.  Vince 
 Sam,  Yes, let's omit the guys who left the company, but we can include the summer interns.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Sam,  This is a partial list of people to whom I would like to send the volumes:  Volume 1 & 2  Winokur (Enron Board member, Shirley has his address) Jeff Skilling Ken Lay Mark Frevert Greg Whalley Rick Buy Jeff Shankman John Lavorato Dave Delainey   I shall write the cover letter.   Also, we can add additional volume for Kaminski's columns (just 10 copies), including bios and my contributions. I would like to show the depth of talent we have in the group.  Vince       Enron North America Corp. 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 David  Thanks.  I shall get in touch with you a few days before to coordinate the details.  Vince 
 Julie,  The discount is  fine. Look fwd to receiving the books.  Vince 
 Hello Shmuel,  Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were extremely busy and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron on this subject and get in touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition.  I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to cover the cost of your Austin to Houston trip.  Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

 FYI.  This is the list of the Petronas executives visiting Enron on Feb 8. I have invited them to lunch. Would you like to join me for lunch.  I would like to propose a short courtesy meeting at 10  with Jeff/John (5 - 10 minutes), followed by RAC/Research presentation till 11:30.  Vince  P.S. I shall reserve a conference room for this meeting 
 Sam,  Let's include this week points 1.1 and 1.2. It's by Martin and Shaleesh.   Vince 
 Kevin,  Makes perfect sense.  Vince 
 FYI. I shall not be surprised if Grant knock on our door again in a few weeks. I told him he could not count on the same generous treatment he got the first time.  Vince 
 Norma,  FYI  Vince 
 Sally,  Thanks. The name of the person is at the bottom of this sequence of messages.  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff,  A few comments on the model:  1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant. In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the details and in the inputs and calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results depending on the quality of inputs.  2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We were told that you would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.   Vince 
 Michael,  I think that Keynes was right on the money. He had great insights into the forward markets.  By  the way, what are your thoughts about CA?   Vince 
 Kevin,  Let's meet for lunch next week (Monday of Friday would be best). We can talk about the project and decide who has the right skills to help you.  The person who supports EBS is Stinson Gibner and his lead person is Martin Lin. My secretary's number is 3-5290 (Shirley Crenshaw).  Vince 
 George,  We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people in the first round.  We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a bigger group. We would like to learn form experience how to run it.  By the way, we had an option training for EES (roughly 150 people, over a few weeks). I can give you the materials and we can repeat it if you think it's useful.  Vince 
 Anita,  I can attend. Vince 
 John,  I am forwarding you a resume I have received today. The document has been  distorted in transmission but it's still readable.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Here it comes.  Vince 
 Shirley,  I don't have the resume. We can ask Jennifer Burns if she has it.  Vince 
 Chonawee,  This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s convictions.  Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the company) is by having open communication.  In Enron, facts are friendly.  By the way, it was an excellent presentation.  Vince 
 Please, resend the message. I cannot open the document.  Vince Kaminski 
 Ashley,  Thnaks. I shall attend the reception. I shall ask Shirley to set up a meeting with you to discuss spring events on campus.   Vince 
 Jeff,  We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the numbers you have requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.  The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince    ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001 By ANGUS DONALD  Tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern India yesterday after a power grid breakdown.  Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day, according to power grid officials.  The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham), a leading business organisation, expressed "deep concern" and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could "cripple the economy".  The power failure across eight Indian states, including New Delhi, disrupted train services, water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators.  The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides electricity for 226m people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.  A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, caused an overload of power on other lines, which then failed as well.  Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged. New Delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged.  "We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is most likely to be a technical failure, but we will investigate why it happened," Suresh Prabhu, the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India.  India suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big problem. Thirty per cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according to analysts. In New Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen.  Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh and Delhi for hours.  Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's inefficient power sector. "The slow progress, particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further."

Its "myth and reality" offensive in local newspapers follows the west Indian state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it pays the Texas-based company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating plant at Dabhol is India's biggest single foreign investment.  Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers (IPPs). The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel. The state also pays a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, reflecting the huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of consumption.  A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former official of the World Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is emerging "as the East India Company of the 21st century" - a reference to the British trader that colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th century.  The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power sector. The UK's PowerGen and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, frustrated by long approval procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere.  "India has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points," says Gerry Grove-White, former India general manager of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat to China Light & Power of Hong Kong.  India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 1992, IPPs have added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under construction. This is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth.  Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, winning fast-track project approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a Dollars 1.87bn plant of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas (LNG), will be completed this year. Only two of seven other fast-track proposals have achieved financial closure.  From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating in Maharashtra's then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister of the successor government, says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable.  Enron, whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists, wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment. Enron views India as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, such as energy, gas and bandwidth.  To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed this year. It is building an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas. And it is laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity.  In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight contract. It is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and industrial hub, as an unreliable destination for investment.  Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his predecessor, which threatened to "dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea" - is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options are limited. Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders.  Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility and Enron's main client, is obliged to dispatch or "off-take" 90 per cent of Dabhol's output. Yet MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power.  One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough new regulator has told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the tariff would be Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But with off-take a third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and often higher. In October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take was about 49 per cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, run on cheaper LNG, starts.  These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer.  Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, which have failed to deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power.  Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as transmission and distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and technical losses, is overdue. "Given the limited resources, money would be better spent on T&D rather than on new plant," says Oliver Blackaby, managing director of N M Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network.  For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade magazine, one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is "having flexibility to deal with externalities".

 Sally,  I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request. They renewed their request for Enron's participation.  What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the project.  My recommendation is to forget it.  Vince 
 Shirley,  I might have  already sent it to you with a request to renew.  Vince

 Jeff and John,  I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us their progress implementing risk management practices.  I shall arrange the meeting and get RAC involved. Would you like to meet them for a short courtesy meeting (5 - 10  minutes)?  Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned (given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8, at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.  Vince 
 Zimin,  I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars will crowd out the brown bag lunches.  The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.  For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag lunches are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.  Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.  Vince 
 Rick,  I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us their progress implementing risk management practices.  Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for banks (you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?  Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned (given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8, at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.  I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.  Vince

 John,  I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional contribution.  Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.   Vince

 Sheila,  I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you for advice how to handle this case.  My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more convinced I become that some action is required.  Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a female employee was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar cases, courts  subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints.  The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial. If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double standard in handling sexual harassment cases.  My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and sexual harassment prevention class.  Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.   Vince

 Jim,  Thanks a lot. It is difficult to find a better example example of commitment to Enron and to professional excellence than  our weather guys.  Vince 
 Thanks,  I shall attend.  Vince Kaminski      Tracy L Arthur  12/20/2000 04:20:35 PM 
 Mike,  I am sending you a message regarding a potential candidate.   Please, take a look at him and see if he fits better our group or Mark Tawney's group.  Vince =20 
 FYI  Vince  P.S. Meeting on Wed at 10 
 Krishna,  It looks  like a long shot. It will take a long time to bring this person here.  Vince 
 Ehud,  Best holiday wishes to you and your family.  I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference  I have approached a number of executives at Enron. Greg Whalley speaks in London a day before. Louise Kitchen, the mother  of EnronOnline will ski (this is the week of school holidays in England and her family will come here).  One suggestion I want to make is Rick Causey. I talked to him and he is willing to be a speaker. He is a very senior and important executive of Enron and a UT grad.  Any thoughts?  Vince 
 Kay,  I am glad you liked it. Merry Christmas.  Vince 
 Dolores,  I am glad you liked it. Merry Christmas.  Vince 
 Heather,  I am forwarding this message to 2 groups in Enron that may be interested.  Vince 
 Becky,  The charges to Corp. go to RAC and are based on my projections of expected expenses.  The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the parenthesis show amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to RAC:  1. Value-at-Risk Group (VaR)  MD (25%) VP (60%) Director (100%) 5 managers (100%)  2. Enterprise wide risk management  Manager (100%) Associate (100%)  Currently we hired (or will shortly hire)  4 managers for the VaR group. The expansion of the VaR group was planned based on the requests from RAC for more support.   Vince 
 Sam,  Are you sure  you cannot make it just for a few minutes?  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Molly,  It  seems that we got only Bill Bradford so far.  Given that almost everybody will be out that week, we probably should move the interview to the beginning of January, even if it means higher costs.   Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 David,  The CUSIP of the bond I have is  694308EF0 PGC  8.375%  5/1/25 1st & Ref Mortgage bond, ser 92B.   Vince 
 Juliusz,  Sorry, I have to cancel the lunch meeting today.  Pleas, give a call sometimes today. Maybe we can meet for drinks Friday afternoon.  I am taking the next week off.   Vince 
 Gilian,  No, we don't  additional need more data. I understand Stinson Gibner has already sent you a reply with his findings.  Vince 
 Stinson,  The spreadsheet below shows the allocations I made for EBS. The numbers in magenta show percentage allocations, Of course, Samir and Samer are gone, ad so is Roman. The problem is that once I give the percentages to accounting they become fixed for one year. 
 Steve,  Yes, I read it. I am going to talk about it with Ted Murphy and possibly Rick Buy. As you have correctly pointed out, the model validation issues cannot be handled  internally by Research.  The problem is that everybody is swamped right now with PRCs and end-of-year issues.  I don't think we shall send our  full  VaR model under any circumstances. We can offer to sell a reduced version based on RiskMetrics.  By the way, our meeting Tuesday will start at 11:00  a.m., Houston time.   Vince 
 Mike,  What do you think? I see pro's and con's. The argument against is that during PRCs people comment positively or negatively about a person and this is how the word is spread about an employee. Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.   Vince 
 Brian,  No problem.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Can we confirm it?   Vince 
 Shirley,  Is this an upgrade for Maureen?   Vince

 Dave,  I would like to recommend to you Sandeep Kohli who is likely to approach you regarding a position in your area.  I have  been working with Sandeep for a number of years and I was always impressed with his skills, intelligence and mature, thoughtful approach to solving business problems.  He is currently located in India (our DPC unit) and is looking for a permanent position with Enron in Houston for family reasons (his wife is from Houston and has a family here). Of course, there are some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.  Vince 
 Sheila,  Gran't number:  (281) 381 9987.   This is his cell phone number.   Vince 
 Frank,  We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (Ph.D.,  M.S. level). A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive around 11:45 - 12:00.   We shall get the projector for you.  Please, keep all the receipts for refund.  Vince

 David,  A follow-up on my voice-mail message regarding Grant.  Dave Delainey is on board regarding Grant. We can bring him back at the same level and comp, assuming that resignation was handled in a professional manner.  DD asked me to work out the details with you. Can we meet to talk about it on Monday?   Vince 
 Norma,  Thanks for your mesage.  1. I shall ask Krishna to reduce his rollover to 40 hrs.  2. Any resolution on bonus for Lance (October 2nd start)? Anita Dupont is in the same situation.  3. Can you send me a copy of exit interview for Grant Masson? There is a special reason I need and I shall explain it to you in person.  4. What time next week would be good for lunch? I would be glad to invite you Molly and Ramona. What about Friday the 22nd?   Vince 
 Anita,  Shirley is out sick today.  Can you, please, confirm my lunch with Bjorn Hagelman (Enron), 11.30 today (Friday).  Please, ask him if he wants me to make reservations? If the answer is Yes, please, make a reservation for 2 at Damian's, 11:45.  Vince 
 Bjorn,  Let's meet 11:30 at the lobby. My cell phone  number is 713 410 5396,  just in case.  Do you want me to make reservations? Can you drive (I took a bus today)?  Vince 
 Kevin,  Can you join us? I  may be 5  minutes late, coming from another meeting.  Vince

 Martin,  Works for me.  Vince  Shirley, Please, put on my schedule. 
 Dave,  No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.  Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).  I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He wants to come back after 2 months.  My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite competent. I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. "The Return of Grant Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth opportunities (and that I am good manager).  Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required to hire a VP.

 Chris,  I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.  1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation equation and the way it's typically discretized.  2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain what CT is (perhaps a footnote).   I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.  ****************************************************************************** *************** 1.

 Hi Helyette,  Congratulations on your papers.  The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals (it's circulating through different parts of the company where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute the contract  in the first few days of December.  I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.  Vince 
 Anita,  Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay. I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and Amitava, based on the business need.  One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.  Vince

 Donna,  Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could coordinate the dinner with the students and the faculty.

 John,  Thanks. Stinson will be able to join us for dinner. He is opting out of the paper due to his big workload but we can get his perspective on=20 the last 8 years he spent at Enron.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Can you, please, arrange a phone interview:  Alex, Lance, Vasant and myself.  Vince 
 Frank,  Thanks. I have given your name to the employee  Energy and Power Risk Management magazine who organizes Power2001 Conference in Houston (May of 2001).   Vince 
 Frank,  I have reviewed materials from GARP but did not find any information about the speaker's perks (like, for example, the right to invite another person, free of charge).  I shall message GARP with this question.  Please, give me a few more days to think about GARP presentation.  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Claudio,  I have done it twice in the past. I shall be glad to help again.  Vince 
 Soussan,  Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday. There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the Galleria. I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?).  You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.  Look forward to meeting you.  Vince

 Tom,  We are currently space constrained but we shall always take a qualified candidate. Please, ask George to send me a resume and we shall get in touch with him to arrange a phone/on-location interview.   Vince 
 John,  FYI  Vince 
 Molly,  I think you called his bluff. If he does not fax a copy of his paycheck stub, we should not talk to him. He never talked to me about  it. If he made a true statement about his compensation, he should have no reservations about sending us the confirmation.  Vince     Enron North America Corp.

 Jeff,  I am sending you a draft of the outline  of the course on energy derivatives. I would  appreciate your comments before I finalize it.  By the way, did we agree on the time schedule for the class? Tuesday or Thursday evening would work for me.  Vince

 Becky,  Becky,  I have called  you this morning about it. It makes perfect sense.  Vince 
 Shirley,  I probably asked you about it already. I want to renew.  Vince 
 Shalesh,  Please, look into it. Can we give them this information? I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to support the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.  Vince 
 Yann,  I have forwarded this request to a member of my group who supports Enron Broadband Services.  He will check into availability of data and confidentiality issues.  Vince

 Jim,  I shall be glad to talk to them.  Vince 
 Hello Charlene,  I am forwarding you a resume of a student from Berkeley. We would  like very much to have him as a summer intern with my group.  Please, let me know if your program can accommodate him.  Vince

 Shirley,  Yes.  Vince 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Gary,  Any interest in this candidate? His profile does not exactly match my  requirements.  Vince 
 Paul,  Can you give me more information about  your computer skills?  My group is very hands-on oriented and  computer programming is a critical skill.   Vince 
 Jinbaek,  May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.  I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short notice.  When you come here you can determine in what area he could make the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail him independently and talk to him.  Vince 
 Vasant,  I gave my slot to Zimin.  We are organizing a group with RAC to send a few people to this conference at a discount to full cost.  Vince 
 Shirley,  2 expense checks:   $8,937.30 $4,971.30   Vince 
 Larry,  Please, take a look at this candidate. I don't think his profile matches my requirements, but he looks quite interesting.  Vince 
 Rick,  I asked Greg Whalley and he declined (he has a speaking engagement in London  a day before).  I have sent an invitation to Louise Kitchen and she has not replied yet. I  shall catch her at the management conference in San Antonio and ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well.  Vince 
 Eric,  FYI  Vince 
 Sam,  This is the paper by Sharad.  I shall Stinson  to do some editing.  Vince 
 Tanya, Naveen,  Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes of prices and positions. This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas portfolio. A big jump in the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big.  If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there should be no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Lunch with Kristin is scheduled for the 20th of this month (Monday).  Vince 
 Frank,  I am definitely interested in the resume. I can meet the candidate on campus when I visit my son. I am planning to come to Palo Alto around Thanksgiving.  Also, Energy and Power Risk Management (an English publication) organizes every year in Houston a POWER RISK conference (typically in May). They ask me for recommendations regarding speakers. Would you be interested in participating?  Vince 
 Lance.  Perfect.  Vince 
 It's OK to delay the materials for Duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain.  Vince 
 Krishna,  FYI   Vince 
 Paulo, Alex,  Any interest?  Vince 
 Mike,  FYI  Vince 
 Eric,  I have one on EGS, one on Dhabol and a recent one on entrepreneurship  in Enron. You can buy the case studies from the HBS web-site.  Vince 
 713 303 5973 
 Jens,  I think I have cc'ed  you on this. John Nowlan approved and Stinson Gibner has the curves available for you.  Vince 
 Stinson,  He keeps bugging us about it. Any thoughts what we should do?  Vince 
 Vincent & Ludmila Kaminski 10 Snowbird The Woodlands, TX 77381 
 Bryan,  We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will have no objections to it.  Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the system you want to buy with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this endeavor.  An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be rolled into the existing risk systems.   Vince 
 Location 0-413 Compnay  0741 PIN 003778 
 Rick and Ted,  It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding chicken houses.  I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under the hood and examine the mechanics of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee.  Please, let me know what your thinking is.   Vince 
 Mark,  It was done in collaboration with John Sherriff.  Vince 
 Eric,  I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge. I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it.  When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was ready and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.  I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.  I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.  Vince 
 David,  I regret to inform you I am unable to attend the conference due to previous commitments. Would you consider a speakers form our London office?  Vince 
 Jeff,  I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at a VP level. According to new human resources procedures this decision requires a support of three senior executives.  I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma Villarreal at H/R.  Thanks.  Vince

 Gentlemen,  I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 power trading desks. I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).  Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it very useful for modeling transmission problems. Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this recommendation.  Vince 
 Lance,  Please, ask Shirley to order.  Vince 
 Steve,  I assume it's 9:00 a.m.  my time, Monday. It works for me.  I haven't responded in time to the your message re Thursday. I had a few back to back meetings in the morning and I read your message quite late into the day.  Vince 
 Lance,  Any interest?  Vince 
 Kevin,  Please, call me tomorrow to finalize the list.  Vince 
 Michele,  Friday morning would work better for me.  Vince 
 Greg,  This is the info  about the  WEBI program at Wharton.  Vince 
 David,  Possibly.  Vince 
 Stinson,  I think I read one of his papers. Mechanical application of one technique to power prices, no useful insights.  We can still invite him.  Vince 
 Sam,  We shall go with Sharad for next Monday.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 FYI  Vince 
 Cathy,  Thanks.  Please, add my assistant to the distribution is. Her name is Shirley Crenshaw.  Vince 
 Sam,  Thanks for forward thinking. What about a new asscoiate Kate Lucas or Sharad?  I shall beat on people (or myself) to produce     Enron North America Corp. 
 Stinson,  I should be. I shall be driving back from Waco and barring any emergency I shall join you.  Vince 
 Jean-Pierre,  Sorry. I have previous commitments on these days.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, register me for this.  Vince 
 Neil,  I shall do the review with pleasure.  Vince 
 Donna,  Jeff Shankman will join me for the kickoff. We would like to invite the students and faculty members to dinner, following the presentation.  Any recommendations regarding the restaurant?  Vince 
 FYI  My trip to Wharton (yes, again).  Vince 
 David,  When do you need my signature. I missed the presentation last Tuesday (I was sick) and would like a day or two to review the product.  Vince 
 Kevin,  The donuts are a great idea. I think we should add Jeff and John as well (baskets).  Vince 
 Iris,  We can mention to Ben that the papers will be edited and combined into a coherent review.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Please, take a look.  Vince 
 Frank,  Great idea. I think it will be an opportunity to brainstorm about the problem.   Vince 
 Ehud,  November 15 is a bad day for me. I shall be in San Antonio for our annual management conference. Practically everybody who  counts in Enron will be there.  Still no response from Louise. I shall catch her tomorrow in person.  Vince 
 Tom,  Electronic version is OK.  Vince 
 Matt,  With  pleasure.  Vince 
 Tani,  Confirmed.  Vince 
 Christie,  I am forwarding you a message I have received from the University of Houston. Can you help them? We have a very good relationship with the UoH.  Vince 
 Tani,  Look forward to meeting you in Houston. What about Wednesday, 10 a.m. or 8 a.m.?  Vince 
 Poetry Analysis/ Discussion    Tulips  The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free - The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.

 Steve,  RAC will be a bit unhappy about it. I think that Bjorn will object to it. Let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it. The question is how to present it to RAC in a such a way that Rodrigo will not be put in a bad light.  Vince 
 Rakesh,  Looks fine.  Vince 
 Kirstee,  With pleasure.  Vince    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
 Frank,  Dec 14   would be  better for us. We have already scheduled an internal presentation on December 7.  Please, go ahead and make a reservation. The best place to stay is Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree Downtown (within a walking distance to Enron). It is important to specify the downtown location for both hotels.  Vince 
 Kevin,  I would like to take the class as well.  Vince 
 Becky,  I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you already. I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere Overdyke), oil trading and coal.  For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.  Vince 
 Louise,  Would you consider being a keynote speaker at this conference (Feb 22 evening)?  The conference will be held in Austin.  We have a very good relationship with UT and we are helping them to organize this conference.  I shall be glad to provide you more information about the event.  Vince

 Joel,  Congratulations and best luck.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Margaret,  I shall invite Hunter Shiveley. I think it will cover ENA.  Vince 
 Margaret,  I shall try to invite Hunter Shiveley who is in charge of Gas Market Fundamentals.  Vince 
 Shirley,  John is important but not that important.  He will come here.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Aziz,  Please, contact me before or after the presentation and we can find a time slot to chat later on Friday.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Looks great.  Vince 
 Duane,  Sorry I will miss you. I have a meeting with Chester already on my schedule.  Vince 
 Alex,  I agree. Let them make up the data. Please, ask Shirley to determine convenient date and time.  Vince 
 Kristin,  I think that we have done enough for this guy. All we can do is to give somebody a chance. The God helps those who help themselves.  Thanks for all your help and your efforts.  Vince 
 Julie,  Yes,  this is how we split this expense internally. Please, send it to me.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Pierre-Philippe,  The time of the presentation, 11:30 is fine with me. I shall arrive Thu evening and I shall get to the hotel by cab. Thanks for your kind offer to meet me at the airport but I shall be arriving at late hour and don't want to inconvenience you. Kevin Kindall from Enron will come with me. I shall also need a projector for my M/S Power Point presentation on "Volatility in the US Power Markets". I shall be very glad to meet with Duane.  Vince 
 Stinson,  It should be in the attached message.  Vince 
 John,  I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his model is to go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his company. Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase price of $55,000, in case we buy the software package.  The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required level of support.  Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit with us on Tuesday, November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.   Please, let me know what you think.  Vince 
 Stinson,  Who coukd help with curve extraction?  Vince 
 Julie,  A clarification. We had an agreement with Chris and Les to contribute  AUS 10,000 as a part of the cost.  Vince 
 Keith,  The article I mentioned.   Vince  ***********************************************   rashed By Tax Selling  But are there bargains among the discards?   By Michael Santoli   Here it is more than six months since even the most intransigent last-minute filers wrote checks to the IRS to render to the government its due for their financial good fortune in 1999. By rights, this should be a season relatively free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the presidential candidates' parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz.  And yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market (which in recent weeks has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming demands of this year's levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet another taxing October for investors.  The jump-and-stumble course the major stock indexes have taken this year is being blamed for a particularly intense effort among mutual-fund managers and other big investors to sell their losers. The steep ramp-up in stocks that persisted from the fall of 1999 through the first quarter of this year -- led by the technology must-haves -- left funds with ripe profit-taking opportunities when the Nasdaq surge flagged in April. This sell-high activity generated heavy capital gains in many portfolios -- tax liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with realized losses by selling stocks that have cratered.  The fact that so many funds are enduring a flat-to-down year in this difficult market has only added to the urgency. Investors aren't fond of getting stuck with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of a bull market. So managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders will react to funds' kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of their holdings fails to appreciate or, worse, falls outright. With the majority of funds operating on an October 31 fiscal year end, and given a trend toward letting investors know their estimated tax hit well before year's end, much of this selling has been concentrated in a brief period of weeks.  One fund executive attending a Fidelity mutual-fund conference last week reported that, oddly, some managers have resolved to be contrary and "overdo it" in selling even their winners. The theory, he reports, is that if they're going to have a capital-gains distribution anyway, the most skittish shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its tax liability, whether it's, say, either 10% or 12% of net asset value. So the idea is to take profits and "reload" for the benefit of those investors who will stick around.  Now, with the Nasdaq off 22.7% since Labor Day and 8% so far in October, much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the assault is ending. This line of reasoning counsels that it's time to peek out of the foxhole and survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick up in expectation of a late-year rally.  Not so fast. While it's true that in past years, these hard-hit tax-selling victims tend to recover in the early part of November, the move often proves fleeting. Like a ball being held under water, these stocks jump when the downward pressure is released, but that doesn't mean they escape gravity's pull for long. Soon enough, they're hit by a secondary wave of selling by investors who tidy up their tax situation closer to the end of the year.  The quantitative equity research team at Lehman Brothers has studied recent market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling. In the process, the analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look vulnerable to persistent weakness through most of the fourth quarter. The study scanned the Russell 3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks -- for those that had fallen at least 40% this year through September, and had lost at least 10% in the prior six months. They also plucked only those stocks that had seen rising trading volume over that period. The idea was to find only those names that seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo. In 1997, there were just eight such stocks. In 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on a par with this year's tired crop.  Murali Ramaswami of Lehman says, "There's both a tax-loss story and a momentum story. Losers continue to be losers." At least through the fourth quarter they do.  The negative momentum of these stocks tends to gather speed from the first week of November to Christmas. In this period, from 1997 through last year, the Losers Portfolio dropped an average of 20% more than did the Russell 3000 index. Bottom-fishers, beware.  The resulting list, which Lehman billed to its institutional clients as a menu for hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in the major downside themes of the year. Name a major telecom-services provider and the odds are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away from the group. Big retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the slowing economy has ravaged shares of Circuit City, Dillards, Saks and others. And of course there are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a mania undone, in a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the market's windshield. Witness Barnesandnoble.com and Razorfish.  An intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for next year's Comeback Stock of the Year will encounter no shortage of companies that appear, for the moment, broken and in need of an inspired strategic revamping, some slick investor-relations work and plenty of luck. Former blue chips such as Lucent Technologies, Bausch & Lomb and Dial seem to fall into that club, where for investors a love of dirt-cheap stocks and a strong backbone is the price of admission. DuPont, which recently ratcheted down its 2001 growth forecast and is beset by high raw-materials costs, is arguably apt to remain in the investors' time-out chair for a while as well. That its shares failed to sell off after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most hopeful sign one can seize on with regard to the chemicals giant.  Still, for the investor patient enough to endure what could be a stormy November and December, a few sizable companies with temporary problems but solid long-term growth stories are attracting some fund managers looking to buy. As detailed in Barron's last week ("Retailers on Sale," October 23), there is reason to expect better performance from selected retail chains. Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, merits attention both for its buoyant same-store sales growth in a retail headwind and for its repair of the addled Fingerhut catalogue division, which suffered a spike in delinquencies. The shares are off their trough levels in the low 20s, but a recent quote of 28 still seems a better-than-fair price for a company that some pros believe could earn more than $5 a share next year.  The advertising business this year is being given the cold shoulder by investors after a torrid love affair through 1999. Fearing that the dot.com washout and resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad firms, investors abandoned Interpublic, the third-largest owner of ad agencies after WPP and Omnicom.  But Mark Greenberg, manager of the Invesco Leisure fund, saw a chance to pick up a "good, solid company" inexpensively when Interpublic hit the low 30s. Now at 39, Interpublic is still fetching just 22 times forecast 2001 earnings, which are expected to grow 15%, faster than profits for the overall market.  "I bought some early this year and added to it just recently. The bad news is probably priced into the stock, and then some," he says.  Madison Avenue markdown  Interpublic, parent of McCann Erickson, among other firms, has always suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom, a market darling considered the class operator in the industry. But Interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing and public-relations business, which are growing faster than the traditional Madison Avenue game. Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot.coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas, and Interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces.  In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis Communications, a big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your Sunday paper. A well-loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid-cap fund manager in 1999, Valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories. Investors bailed out in droves, halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20. Now at 25, the shares are "absurdly cheap," says Greenberg, who also owns Valassis.  Another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined. Even with its growth forecast revised downward, Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% long-term rate, and earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a share. That leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits. And it's worth noting that in times of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain-hunters.  With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter rebound in the year's losers that's been documented by Lehman Brothers is hopelessly distant.  If you're tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a beaten-down mutual fund, check first to see if it will be among those making a capital-gains distribution later this year. In that case, you'll be on the hook for the tax even though you didn't participate in the gain. (You can take the plunge without worrying about payouts if you're buying the fund for a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or an IRA.)  But at least in selected stocks, it seems the machinations of tax-fearing investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 25%-off sale, and you don't need to redeem a manufacturer's coupon to take advantage. 
 Shirley,  I hope it's OK with the apartment company.  Vince 
 Cindy,  Hopefully the paper John Martin and I will work will become the standard reference for this topic.  Vince 
 Alex,  Can you set up a meeting to review this product. They have an office in Houston.  Please, invite people on the distribution list.  Vince 
 Mike,  We shall call you to schedule a meeting to review the product.  Vince 
 Scott,  Not at all. I left to make a quick call and it required a number of follow-up calls.  The presentation was very interesting and professional.  One of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software packages. Otherwise, everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose economies of scale.  I shall talk to my associates about your product  and get back to you.  Vince 
 Molly,  I would like to invite this student for an interview, sometimes in late December when things slow down.  Interviews with all my direct reports and George Hopley.  Vince

 Paul,  Thanks for your message. Look fwd to your call.  Vince 
 Grant,  Tuesday or Wednesday would work.  Please, call me in the morning or at home tonight (281) 367 5377. Alternatively, we could have  breakfast.  Vince 
 John,  I am forwarding to you the request by Jens.  We gave in the past our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics. What is your position on this request?  Vince 
 David,  This is the outline of the EWRM project.  Vince 
 Tani,  No problem. We shall look at the curve on Monday. I have organized a  small team to examine the curve from different perspectives.  Curve validation is normally a RAC prerogative and I shall get them involved on Monday  Vince

 Steve,  Yes. I shall try to call you later this morning. I had a schedule from hell the last few days.  Vince 
 Steve,  All these provisions make a lot of sense. Anjam showed very poor judgment one more time. He got a very generous offer to move to Houston.  I recommend keeping him on the payroll, and at home, as long as possible.  Vince 
 Kevin,  Thanks a lot.  Vince 
 Martin,  Can you, please, call Shu and provide him with information about EBS?  Vince 
 Kevin,  I would greatly appreciate if you could help me in this case. Yaron's father helped me a lot to open many doors at Berkeley.  Vince

 Charlene,  Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in the recruiting process. His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a Super Saturday? I really want to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting efforts.  Vince 
 Jinbaek,  We shall invite you to an interview in Houston.  Vince 
 Ashley,  Another student who responded after my presentation. What do you think? Should we talk to him (Research) directly?  Vince 
 Iris,  Can you forward me the attachments to this message. I cannot open them.  Vince 
 Ashley,  This is one resume I got today. I think that it makes sense to invite him for an interview directly with my group. He does not qualify as an analyst candidate. What do you think?  Vince

 Krishna,  I have received two additional  requests for help from EES.  1. Jeremy Blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the level of our support of EES. It probably makes sense to set up a meeting with Jeremy ASAP and discuss specifics (you, me, and it probably makes sense to invite Marty Sunde as well).  2. George Posey called and asked fro help with statistical sampling of  Dublin customers. Please, give him a call to set up a meeting.  I shall call you tomorrow to discuss both requests.  Vince

 Elena,  Please, review the energy related info in this database (if any) and talk to me about it.  I would like to do some research in this area and ask you to write a summary report. Nothing urgent.  Vince 
 Cindy,  I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in India. I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important chapters. I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of the book.  In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. Mehta. The person in charge of our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an invitation to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be here for the management conference.   Vince

 Barbara,  I have forwarded your message to the members of my weather/ weather derivatives team.  Vince 
 Joe, Mike,  Please check with PR first if we want too talk to her and run  it by Mark. I think it is in our interest to be quotes extensively in the press.  Vince 
 Aproved in both cases.  Vince Kaminski 
 Steve,  I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather negative: he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth and technical details.  He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive side.  Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after 18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.  Vince 
 Mike,  Please check with Alison. She sent  the  form again. I think she lost  what you sent her.  Vince 
 Maureen,  Any interest?  Vince

 Mark,  Two points.  1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power Play", is on a tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a meeting last Sunday at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 people attended.  2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself.  I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.  b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up with a term "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."  c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.  d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and accomplishemnts.  The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.   Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key players. Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.  Vince

 Chris,  This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.  1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the classification based on 3 categories:  a. variance/covariance  method b. historical simulation c. Monte Carlo simulation.  Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument.  2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio. The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) that may involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).  The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you the references from home).  3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).  4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. This process may be a source of a big error.  5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are  portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments).  Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).  Vince 
 Thanks.  Vince

 John,  Sorry to see you go. Let's stay in touch.  Vince       Enron Technology 
 Grant,  Did you respond to this one?  Vince 
 Shan,  It's nice to hear from you. Congratulations on the new job. FT is my favorite publication I never miss (and I read a number of different FT publications, including FT Energy collection).  You can contact Harry Arora (X 6750)  here in London who works on finance related E-commerce projects. He may give you some useful comments. I shall be myself very interested in the first issue of your new publication.  Regards  Vince 
 Naveen,  Most of these tests have been already coded. The code and the associated spreadsheets may have been lost inn the sands of time. Please, check with Vasant: it may save you some time.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please register me for this.  Vince 
 Rodrigo,  I think it is Churrasco's, A South American restaurant. I shall make reservations for the 12th. I shall also arrange the meetings on Tuesday with different units of the Research group.   Vince 
 Ashley,  FYI  Vince 
 Rodrigo,  We shall be very glad to meet you.  If you can dedicate one day to meeting the members of the Research Group I could arrange a series of meetings with different units.  What about Sep the 11th or Sep the 12th (Monday or Tuesday)?  If you are free one evening we can have dinner together.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, register me for this conference.  Vince 
 Shmuel,  Thanks for the message. I am working with our recruiter, Ashley Baxter, to finalize the date of the trip. I shall shoot for October the 23rd if this date works for the rest of our team.  Vince 
 Michael,  Thanks for the information. We shall have the results for you by tomorrow morning.  Vince      Michael Anderson @ AZURIX 08/23/2000 07:48 PM 
 Norma,  I cannot open the Excel file. It's encrypted.  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Mulong,  I think you can easily find this information on Internet.  Vince 
 John,  Easter may not work for me because I shall most likely be visiting my son who goes to school in California (we were spending Easter together for the last three years).  Vince 
 Rabi,  Thanks for your message. Everybody who interviewed you was greatly impressed with your technical skills and professional attitude.  We shall extend an offer to you within a day or two.  Vince 
 John,  I haven't received the invitation yet to the Sep 13th meeting. I shall contact you Thursday regarding the CMU presentation.  Vince 
 Ashley.  FYI. What about Oct 16?  Vince 
 A reminder to the Houston crew. The meeting starts at 11:30. Please, be on time.  Vince 
 Doug,  Propane prices as promised.  Vince 
 Stinson,  No problem. I shall forward the letter to HR to enter this information into the company's records.  I hope you will have good time and come back with fresh dose of energy.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, add the date at the right place.  Vince 
 Jeff,  I met with Li Sun last night and I shall take her for the first rotation. She comes across as a very smart and highly motivated person.  I am planning to go with Mark Palmer to Wharton in October to finalize the deal.  Vince 
 Mulong,  We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away. Please look at the last winter and the winter of 95/96.  We shall prepare for you the electricity price information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but you have to approach FT (the publishers of Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price index we recommend using)  and request the permision to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute this information.  Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that we can produce the time series for you, conditional on the permission from the publishers of Megawatts Daily.  Vince Kaminski 
 Ted,  Take a look.  Vince 
 Christian,  About two years ago I asked Joe Hrgovcic to look tinto EVT applications. As far as I know he is the only person in the group, in addition to me, looking at EVT.  Vince 
 Mark,  I fully agree with you regarding general trends. I see  great progress in software applications that facilitate the process and make it almost painless to the end-user.  With you permission, I can show the material you sent me to my son, who studies computer science, and ask him for his view.  Vince 
 Phil,  Wednesday would work for me.   Vince 
 Jeff,  No problem. We shall invite her for an interview. A/A programs has real problems with logistics.  Vince 
 Anita,  No  problem.  Vince 
 Elena,  Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.  We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has to obtain permission from FT (Megawatts Daily). I shall cc you on my msg to him.  Vince 
 John,  Please, take a look at this resume. One complicating factor: this person is under freeze (EI employee).  Vince 
 FYI  Vince 
 Shelly,  I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.  Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up. I have not seen her resume.  Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.  Vince 
 John,  Thanks. I have reserved March the 2nd for the meeting.  Vince 
 Elena,  Can you, please, help with these prices? Very urgent.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Thanks.  Vince 
 Kim,  I am sending you the presentations by Krishna and Y. Feng.  These presentations may be further modified by both Krishna and Youyi before Wednesday.  Vince 
 Mark,  FYI.  What about going to Wharton in October to attend the E-commerce conference?  Vince 
 Stinson,  Can you coordinate these visits?  Vince 
 Vasant,  Can you send me the electronic version of the documents for Ben Gleason (cost of capital)? I would like to play with the numbers and check a few ideas.  Vince 
 Giuseppe,  It's great. What about Saturday, around 4:00 p.m.?  I shall send you the directions to my house.  Vince 
 Minor changes I made to Alex's paper.   Vince

 Mike,  Bad news.  It may be necessary to go to Sydney.  Vince 
 Vasant, Please, take a look at this eresume.  Vince 
 Sam,  Do we have a new person to cover?  Vince    Enron North America Corp. 
 Pierre-Philippe,  I have contacted Allison Bailey to ask her to move her visit to the campus to coincide with my presentation. I hope to hear from her soon.  Vince Kaminski  P.S.  Nice WEB site 
 Quentin,  I have just received another message from Sydney.  Phil Taylor from our office is Sydney is coordinating your  interview.  Thanks for the copy of your paper.  Vince 
 Mike,  Any comments?  Vince 
 Quentin,  I forwarded your resume to our Sydney office with a request to invite you for an introductory interview. I would also like  to arrange a phone interview with you sometimes next week. My assistant will call you regarding the timing.  Vince 
 Chris,  My evaluation form for Jeff.  Vince      Enron North America Corp. 
 Scott,  Please stop by when you visit Houston. Give me a few days' warning to set up a meeting.  Vince 
 Shirley,  Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 Vera,  We shall talk to the accounting group about the correction.  Vince 
 Darrell,  Grant just alerted me that I sent you only  part of the text.  Here is the full chapter with an aged version of Gran't part. What I sent you represents an update of his contribution.  Sorry for that.  Vince 
 Anjam,  I have another meeting. Please, talk to Grant.  I shall catch him in the morning to review where we stand.  Vince      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
 Shirley,  Please, reschedule.  Vince 
 Krishna,  We have to talk to Shirley and she will take care of it. Let's catch her ASAP.  Vince 
 Darrell,  Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by Clewlow and Strickland).  Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is less than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same arrangement as in the previous cases).  Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron. Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes no economic sense. He spent the summer building his own computer (1000 MHz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker toiling under his management.  I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.  Regards.  Vince 
 FYI  Bug in Adobe software.   Vince Kaminski 
 I shall interview this candidate next week (a very preliminary interview) to evaluate his potential and determine if he fits Enron's culture.  Do you see a need for a person with his skills in your area (litigation support)?  Vince 
 Craig,  Thanks for the feedback. Elena is doing really great  and I think that she will be a great Enron's asset.  Vince 
 David,  Thanks for the invitation. I shall check my schedule on Monday and will get back to you regarding the conference.  I hope you will a very Happy Easter.  Vince 
 Al,  Thanks. Confirmed for Wednesday, next week, 7:00 a.m.  Vince 
 Grant,  I agree. We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice. I think we extended a very generous offer to him and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to Enron.  Vince    Enron North America Corp.

 Blake,  I forwarded the Azure presentation to Greg Whalley recommending that he takes a look at it.  Vince

 Shirley,  Please, put it on my schedule.  Vince 
 Sam,  Looks good.  Vince 
 Amy,  I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a reasonable decision.  We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a rather vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

 I am forwarding to you a paper by some UT professors. They approached us about the possibility of licensing this technology to us.  Under the nondisclosure agreement, we have to give them an answer in 90 days and tell them why we don't want to use it (if we decline the offer).  Please, don't circulate the paper to other members of the group without letting them know that it's confidential and should not leave Enron. In any case, please, let me know who else saw the paper. We should make sure that the circulation is limited so that it does not leak out.  Vince 
 Hi Kirstee,  Thanks again for all your work on MG. One think to double check is units. Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions come in.  One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing with different cultures (metric system vs. English measures).    Vince      Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe

 Peter,  Please, call me on Monday and we shall set u a conference call.  Vince 
 Julie,  No problem. It's your call but Chris should also be mentioned as number one.  Vince 
 Wendy,  I did not. I shall send somebody to your location to pick it up.  Vince 
 I am sending you an updated version of the MG VaR memo, following the discussion Grant and I had with Bjorn Thursday evening.  Please, let me know if you think more changes are required.  Vince 
 Tony,  Aug 26th 
 Steve,  I shall call you tomorrow about it. My preference is to move Anjam to Houston for some time. Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions and it's better to prevent a potential leak. I have discussed this issue with Dale and Richard  and  they concurred.  I don't  expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than sorry.  Vince 
 Stinson,  No  problem.  Vince 
 Shirley,  No problem.  Vince 
 Thanks for your message. A call sometimes between 7:00 and 8:00 is fine. I come to the office around 7:00 traffic permitting.  Vince 
 Julie,  The introduction looks fine. I have made some cosmetic changes (typos and split infinitives that slipped by). You can safely ignore most o= f=20 them. English is not even my second language.  The corrections are in pink.  Vince 
 Scott,  I shall attend.  Vince     Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff,  I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate Relations Officer at Wharton.  Recommendation.  I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership. The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently, the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies worldwide.  The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K, that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed through grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The choice of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time depending on the business needs.  Benefits to Enron.  Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:  - gaining advance access to current academic research - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus, enhancing   our recruiting efforts - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant influence on public opinion - gaining access to high quality executive education programs  Specific Programs.  The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. I have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.  1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research and corporate engagement related to e-commerce.  Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and enhanced recruitment opportunities.  2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing intellectual property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal organizational structures.  Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of valuation of intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.  3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the scope of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments).  Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination of information about our capabilities in this area.  Potential users of the program at Enron.  My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and Decision Process Center.  Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of Enron can be involved with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.  Vince
