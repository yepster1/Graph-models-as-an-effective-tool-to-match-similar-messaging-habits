 Donna:  what is Gay day?  I do not want to miss any significant events. 
 Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August and beyond.  1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's transport to be close to $1 million/ month.  2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.  3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time.  4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties.  5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time.  6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million to the desk. 
 Toni:  Debra is a nice enough person, but does not really fit our needs.  She did not seem to fully understand what our job would entail, and I had a hard time figuring out what she does now.  She does not seem to possess the energ y level or the sense of urgency our job requires.  She is clearly not a hire from my perspective.  Call me if you need anything else. 
 Jennifer:  we can agree to Southwestern's volume amount for the 10 mmbtu's. Thanks. 
 Hey guys:  just to follow up after our discussion this morning on unfinaled invoices, the following will be our procedures.  10th day of month:  invoices sent out 1st business day after 10th:  we will get the unfinaled invoice report from settlements and start working on clearing all discrepancies.  We will have all discrepancies cleared by the 5th work day after the 10th. 25th day of month:  purchase stuff goes out. 1st work day after 25th:  unfinaled invoice report from settlements, same timetable to clear all discrepancies.  Remember:  a discrepancy will consist of anything that could hold an invoice from going out the door. We need to be very receptive to other groups in helping them clear these up. We know more about these deals than anyone, so let's be helpful. Let's also try to clear these up in a way so as to avoid causing these problems in the future, if we can.  Thanks in advance for everyone's help. 
 Toni:  just about any day would be fine.  We are really busy between 7:30 and 11:30 every morning.  Just let me know when you want to sit down with us. Thanks. 
 Toni:  I would be happy to interview thses candidates.  I also have a couple of people that I am already familiar with who I would like to bring in.  What do I need to do to make this happen?  Thanks. 
 Jennifer:  it will be done soon! 
 Bob:  here we go again. 
 Bob:  here is what I have so far.  There may be additions (hopefully not deletions).   Thanks. 
 FYI 
 Tim:  thanks for the info.  We will follow this from now on.

 Just anything you want me to know about to represent you would be fine.  I feel comfortable with where you are going to be placed, and can represent you just fine with Kam's input.  How are things going?  How's the baby.  Hope all is going well.  Take care.  Randy 
 Let me know if we have any problems with this.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  this should be no problem for us.  Thanks. 
   Molly:  thanks.  I will be out this afternnon and tomorrow.  If you need anything let me know.  Thanks again. 
 You may just need warm bodies at this point, big boy 
 I might be interested. 
 Brent:  unfortunately no one from my group will be able to participate in the Kipp Academy events this weekend.  There was some interest though in future events.  Thanks. 
 Barbara:  my e-mail address is Randall.L.Gay@ENRON.COM 
 Julie:  Thanks.  Let me know when you know something different. 
 Irena:  my wife's name is Kathleen. 
 ok 
 Richard:  is there any way that someone could act as your backup for the week you are off?  We can work around Suzanne's vacation schedule with others in her group.  Let me know if we can do anything about this.  Thanks.  Randy 
 Bob:  FYI, my guys tried again last night to update and were unable to. 
 Bob:   I am still wonderring why the external modems my group had were removed.  It seems like I am always having to order modems and accessories every time we move anyone.  Since we are getting ready to move again, maybe we should get an inventory of everything each logistic's person has at their workstation, and this is what should be moved. 
 Isabel:  It is ok to pay this invoice per Randy Gay.  If you need anything else just let me know.  Thanks. 
 Looks good 
 fyi 
 Heather:  Jackie Adams will represent the West desk.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  here is the completed version with changes. 
 Let's try this with the attachment.  Thanks. 
 Heather:  can you proof this and get this ready?   Thanks. 
 Bob:  we probably need to get everyone together on this and come up with a consolidated stance before we go outside the group.  As you pointed out, there are several areas that could open us up to potential problems.  We want ot be careful not to get things out in the iopen that we do not want out. Thanks. 
 The evenings would work best for the West also. 
 Thanks 
 OK 
   Thanks Heather 
 Dave:  sounds good to the West. 
 Bob:  The problem we were having is that if they could get in, it would lock them up for up to 5 minutes and then kick them out.  This would happen over and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a problem.  We need to get back to exceptional service so they do not have to keep logging back in.  Thanks Bob. 
 Scotty:  we definitely want this.  Thanks. 
 could ya'll comment on this please?  Thanks. 
 Suzanne:  thanks for your help and your prompt attention. 
 per your request 
 None as of right now. 
 Phillip:  this should be to you instead of Bob Shiring. 
 George:  a rather cynical view, don't you think? 
 Dave:  my concern not only is with the outage on Sunday, but what may happen between Sunday and Tuesday.  With everything else going on, I would hate for my group to come in here on Tuesday and have problems on top of everything else.  We are going to be having a lot to do and I would feel more comfortable without this distraction.  Let me know what you think. 
 Samantha:  could you please set Josh up to talk wityh me ASAP?  Thanks.  Randy 
 I couldn't get my e-mail to work, so I am using Randy's..... I am having trouble selling our length on PG&E for November.  Is there any way we can settle financially instead of selling the imbalance.  (it is around 16,000).  Let me know  Kim Olinger 
 Patti:  Thanks Scotty 
 No problem 
 The list looks great, although perhaps not all inclusive.  As new issues arise we will add to the list. 
 Ken:  currently we get outside E-mails from PIRA and Enerfax on a daily basis.  I do not believe we would be at a disadvantage if these were blocked the last week.  Thanks. 
 Bob:  we would be looking at El Paso and Northwest Pipelines.  Thanks. 
 Julie:  the price should be $3.54.  Thanks. 
 Who are you calling Ladies? 
 Phillip:  I agree with your conclusions, and we have already started addressing most of these issues.  First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.  We have formally addressed Hillary's performance problems, and he is on  a schedule for improvement or he is out.  We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, and next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we are not getting a return on that investment.  The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc. In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable with her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other inequities through the bonus pool.  In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should help in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a salary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you and Mike still want to do.  As regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these prices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, especially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these individuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for expanding the desk.  Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver office do all nominations for IM Denver deals.  This has met stiff resistance in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I would bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated from us if the operations were to move to Denver.  If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks. 
 Ina:  my login is rgay.  Thanks 
 Ina:  could you please get me access to ECT Trading on the O drive?  Let me know if you need anything.  Thanks. 
 Cooper, Phillip Allen pointed me in your direction to be added to access for the westpower internet site?  Let me know if you need additional information.  Thanks.  Randy x31991 
 Dwight:  thanks for the sessions we've had.  I think that moving forward in my new job will not allow me the time to continue our sessions.  Once again, thanks. 
 Ina:  from scheduling. the following people will attend tonight:  Suzanne Christiansen Patti Sullivan Matt smith Ted Evans Jan Sutherland Stacey Brewer Hillary Mack Shelly Mendel.  As you know, I will not be attending.  Thanks for everything. 
 Phillip:  the changes I would like to make are to promote Patti to Manager whenever you feel the time is right, and then I am going to recommend Stacey for promotion to Sr. Specialist based on her recent performances.  I also would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks. 
 Phillip:  I'm working on getting the official list. We should have it sometime this afternoon. 
 Theresa:  thanks for all your help over the last week.  We really appreciate it and are glad we can cooperate so closely with the Denver office.  If you need anything, let us know.  Again, Thanks. 
 Check that.?  We have pre-bid starting at 3:00.   Anytime before that would be fine.  Thanks. 
 Carrie:  sounds good.  We can meet anytime between 1:00 and 4:00.  Just let me know.  Thanks. 
 Can you believe this?  We have more red tape than Washington on this. 
 Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate these paths in Unify.  In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity between the systems.  Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today in 21c2 to discuss.  Please feel free to attend and give your opinions. 
 Excellent job.  Thanks for the good work. 
 Brandee:  i do not plan on being out any time in October as of this time. Thanks. 
 Diane:  if you could handle this please.  Thanks. 
 Sabra:  so thank you for giving blood, which means as much to me as the playground equipment.  Your support has been like everyone else's, overwhelming.  Take care.  Randy 
 FYI:  our NWPL out of balance is the Canadian desk not keeping up. PSCO and WIC are the Denver office.  Thanks 
 tomorrow will be just fine.  thanks 
 Phillp:  here is Richard's revised letter.  Let me know what you think. Thanks. 
 of course.  You should probably sit with Stacey, because she has the most daisy chains and confirming to do.  Any day but Friday will do this week. Let me know. 
 that is my reputation 
 sure 
 Thanks Stacey 
 I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.  I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did not want to forget them.  1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.  3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure there are a lot of others.  Thanks. 
 Bob:   I have not met with them in a long time, and do not plan to anymore. Thanks. 
 Heather:  just get us all $1000.00. 
 Russell:  the following baseload deals were done with JC Energy for August  PGT Malin  1896/day @ 4.10 PGT Tuscarora  350/day @ 4.10  Thanks. 
 Heather:  no West Deskers need to go late.  Thanks. 
 Russell:  i sold JC Energy 1.284/day @ socal @ Index flat for the month of August.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Donna:  this sounds acceptable to us.  Thanks. 
 Toni:  I do not think Mike would be suitable at this time.  Thanks.
