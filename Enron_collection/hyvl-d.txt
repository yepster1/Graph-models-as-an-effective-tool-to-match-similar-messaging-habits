 FYI----Don't know what happened to my recommendation that they use either an unexecuted agreement notation or call the counterparty from the trading floor on a recorded line. 
 Paul, You say 5,000/day plus fuel.  The delivery point is in the south texas pool.  Where does the fuel come in and how is it determined?  Also, did we ever determine the name of the Reliant Energy entity that was doing the deal?    Paul Burgener@ENRON 09/25/2000 04:45 PM 
 Please review to see if I have made all of the changes you discussed with them. 
 Craig, I have added the FM language to the end of the 1st sentence in No. 1.  If okay, please forward to Ormet. 
 Chris, Please review the attached to see if it covers your concerns.  If so, I will forward to Sean Breen for his review. 
 Gregg, Here's the status of the Reliant matters. 
 Richard, Please change the confirm to provide for signature by both ENA and the counterparty.    Richard Deming@ENRON 05/21/2001 03:09 PM 
 Please review and comment.  Thank you. 
 Attached please find the modified Transaction Agreement which has been revised to reflect the matters you discussed earlier today.  I modified the third item relating to prior approval by Ormet of incremental costs to cover the situation that such transportation or supply becomes unavailable during the period Enron is obtaining Ormet's prior approval. 
 Karen, I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time on. It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will continue to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing and I need to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as possible. If we need to put something in place before the contract is executed, maybe we can document the transaction under the existing GISB contract currently in place between the parties and agree that the transaction will be rolled up under the new master once the Master is executed. 
 Forwarded for your information.  I recall talking with Gregg about this and that we did not intend to use the GISB for anything more than one month.  I think we agreed to let it sit. 
 Melissa, The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have such information.  Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract.    mrgraves@aep.com 06/08/2001 09:49 AM 
 Robin, At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals deviate from the nominated quantities. Please note the comments I provided to you last year relating to this counterparty.  All of those comments are applicable to this Contract form.  I have attached that memo for your review.   Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter.      Jeffrey T Hodge 06/08/2001 08:48 AM 
 Barbara Gray asked me to forward the attached draft of the Back to Back agreement for your review and comments.  This is the agreement contemplated by the letter dated June 1, 2001 relating to the Guadalupe Power Partners L.P. agreement. 
 Please put me and my spouse down for the flu shot as soon as possible. 
 Richard, The GTC is okay to send out for this deal; however, please note the change that must be made to the Delivery Point for this deal.  Call if you have any questions. In the future please advise Barbara Gray of any supply deals at points where an interconnection with HPL is possible, excluding EOL transactions of less than one month.    Richard Deming/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 02:22 PM 
 I am unaware of any physical trading constraints relating to doing business with a cooperative.  We have been doing business with such entities for years.  Can he be more specific about where the restriction is concerning financial trading for a coop.    Stacy E Dickson 06/08/2001 03:13 PM 
 Barbara, Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind just calling him to discuss the matter. 
 Here is the draft as it was Wednesday.  The red-line is the changes to the version supplied by Southern dated June 1. 
 Please review the four which I have changed from Enron Company to Houston Pipe Line Company.  Call if you need anything further.  I intend to be over there next Monday. 
 I sent it again.  Let Me know if you do not receive. 
 Lee, Please have these printed on the new HPL letterhead.  Please correct the addresses and phone numbers.  Ask Janie to attach the current GTC to the letters.  Call if you have any questions.        llpapayoti@aep.com 06/11/2001 10:08 AM 
 Jared, My only comment is that the three references to Enron North America need to be changed to Enron North America Corp.    Jared Kaiser/ENRON@enronXgate 06/12/2001 09:30 AM 
 Dena, Just confirming with you that I am not going to be at today's meeting.  I spoke with Melissa Graves concerning the reason that I would not be able to address the issue until next Monday.  Call me if you have any questions.    dpawlowski@aep.com 06/12/2001 09:07 AM 
 Attached as requested.  Let me know if you need anything further.       Kim Ward/ENRON@enronXgate 06/12/2001 01:50 PM 
 Attached please find a red-line of the changes for the referenced proposal. Please review and let me have your comments.  I had to start from scratch. I limited this to a single transaction as provided in the proposal.  You may recall that you had requested Debra to convert the single proposal into a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement so that it could be utilized by adding future transactions by way of a Confirmation Letter.  The short review time to get something in place will not permit the global changes which may be necessary to cover all the points to make the proposal into a Master.      "Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 11/21/2000 06:29 PM 
 Lillian, Please put me down for the appreciation event.  Thank you.    Lillian Carroll/ENRON@enronXgate 05/30/2001 05:13 PM 
 Danny, Set up a folder on the C-drive called WINZIP and copy each of the attached files into that folder. 
 Keegan, In looking over the list, I did not see Dan Lyons on the list.  I did not= =20 add because I figured Barbara would have included him.  Please ask Barbara = to=20 consider adding him to the invitee list.  Thank you. 
 Greg, Please review my mark-up.  We need to keep the distinction between HPL and GM throughout the document.  Remember GM is the marketing affiliate and HPL is the pipeline.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Candy, My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it. Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann Elizabeth next week.    clbywaters1@aep.com 06/13/2001 09:41 AM 
 Blanca, I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in Columbus before it is signed.  It is my understanding that Pemex has agreed to New York law in the past.  I would not approve it unless they agreed to New York law and arbitration conducted in English.  If you need a quick turnaround, please check with Gary Prescott.    bdaugherty@aep.com 06/13/2001 09:27 AM 
 Debra, Can you please respond to Phil. 
 And how did you fare in all the rain.  I guess you went boating Saturday. 
 It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least they go through the motions.    Jenny Helton/ENRON@enronXgate 06/13/2001 11:46 AM 
 Guess you better send James over to interview them.  They might be willing to relocate.    Jenny Helton/ENRON@enronXgate 06/13/2001 01:01 PM 
 Cathy, The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard interruptible 311 contract.  t is a month to month interruptible contract.  I see no reason why it should not be signed.   Please call me if you need anything further.  I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office starting on Monday. 
 Please generate contract.  Use July 1, 2001 as the effective date.  I will generate a Transaction Agreement to be attached to the contract . 
 Paul, Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to ___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior deal.    Paul Burgener@ENRON 09/26/2000 10:06 AM 
 Ellen, I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895. 
 can you send the confirm to me.  It didn't come my way. 
 Please review and comment. 
 I have made a few red-line changes.  Nothing of substance.  Please review. 
 Will the attached resume work for the bio? 
 A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal.  The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a rather stern voice, "Skippy!"  The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"  Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.  Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!" 
 Will this comply with your request? 
 It appears that it is time to do this again.  Thank you. 
 Kim, I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.  1. Delete the definition of "Credit Support Provider". 2. Add definition as follows:  The term "Guarantor" means, as to Seller, Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp. 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron Corp. is currently rates as BBB. 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted. 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to be handled between the party and its transporter. 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a payment default. 8. The change in 10.2 of "at or" should be restored.  This is a 3 month deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal. 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate and collect a Termination Payment. 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would allow early termination other than a Triggering Event. 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone number or other address will be added. 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted and the original language provided in my previous redline should be restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and are not subject to negotiation by me. 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods. Please reconsider. 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.  Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.       "Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 11/28/2000 01:48 PM 
 Ellen, You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan    Ellen_R_Dailey@reliantenergy.com 11/29/2000 03:22 PM 
 Corrected as requested.  I made a mistake.    Gary W Lamphier 12/01/2000 09:43 AM 
 And the volumes each day is to be?  Where is the address info you were to provide?    Eric Wardle 12/04/2000 09:02 AM 
 Veronica, The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version. Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp. fell below an A rating.  I informed them that we could not agree because it was my understanding that Enron Corp. was currently rated as BBB.  I will let you know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or non-negotiation in the future.  I do not currently have a response from the consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 12/01/2000 02:30 PM 
 Michael, I am forwarding an email from Wade Hicks concerning an e\p mix contract dispute.  Is this in your area and if so can you assist Wade? I do not have any contract documents relating to this in my possession.    W Wade Hicks 12/01/2000 01:51 PM 
 Mike, I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement and have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best efforts" which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read "commercially reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the same throughout the document where we use the term "commercially reasonable best efforts".  With this change, please print out two copies of the contract and two copies of the transaction agreement and proceed with execution of each.  Please call if you have any questions.    "Mike Cesario" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/04/2000 10:49 AM 
 Exhibit C and Exhibit D    "Mike Cesario" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/04/2000 12:40 PM 
 I will be in the office the rest of this week and the middle of next week.    Larry Pardue@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/05/2000 12:03 PM 
 Attached is a draft Transaction Agreement for the 5,000/day Winter deal. Please Review. 
 Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts. The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result.      Eric Bass 12/06/2000 01:36 PM 
 Robert, I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call if you have any questions.    Mark Taylor 12/07/2000 09:28 AM 
  Charlotte, Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me for signature by ENA.

 Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.      Doug Leach 12/05/2000 08:17 AM 
 Kim, I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes. 1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver 10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your pipeline transporter. 2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows: "10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale. In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to Section 17.1." 3. Delete the language "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" that you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12.3. 4. Delete the language added at the end of 12.5 and add language after the word "expired" at the end of the second sentence.  "In no event shall any event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the term of this Contract.  After such 10 day period, the parties shall be obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been remedied, and if such party does not resume performance, such nonperformance shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate pursuant to Section 17.1." 5. Delete item (vii) added in 17.2 because it is adequately covered by my inserted language in 12.5. 6. The $15,000,000 changed in the 3rd line of 17.4 needs to be changed back to $10,000,000.  If the exposure exceeds $10,000,000, that is the reason additional security would be required.  This contract contemplates that Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of $0 whereas the Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of $10,000,000. Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of payment after it makes deliveries under the contract.     "Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 12/07/2000 11:51 AM 
 Mike, Attached please find a draft confidentiality agreement which we would propose to use with the financial information required to be provided pursuant to the guaranty.  If acceptable, please print and start execution, we will sign when we receive the other documents.  Sorry for the delay, I had requested this from our credit department and forgot to follow thru.  M 
 Mike, I have reviewed the requested changes to Exhibit D, I am okay with the proposed changes so long as the same changes are made to Exhibit C.  The change to Suspension of performance on Appendix 1 is okay.  The collateral requirement language has been in the contract for some time so I am concerned with bringing up changes at this late date; however, please let me know your concern so that we can resolve the issue with the Enron Credit group.    "Mike Cesario" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/08/2000 10:16 AM 
 Kim, Let's try to get this signed as soon as possible.  The changes are as we discussed.  I will be out Monday, but will be able to approve the final version on Tuesday.     "Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 12/08/2000 05:18 PM 
 Dave, I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B. Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default by either. Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term of our sales transaction with them. Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract. 
 Phil, Please review the attached and let me know what other changes need to be made.  I have added a sentence in Other of each to provide for the Force Majeure Language to be attached as Exhibit A.  Please let me know if you think this will work. I will be out Monday, but in early Tuesday.  Please call my assistant to set up an appointment for Early Tuesday. 
 Ellen, You may send me the documents at 1400 Smith Street, Suite 3878, Houston, TX 77002.    Ellen_R_Dailey@reliantenergy.com 12/11/2000 11:38 AM 
 Janet, Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm desk using a standard    GTC confirm.    Janet H Wallis 12/12/2000 09:17 AM 
 Ellen, With this added information, can you generate the contemplated confirmation? 
 Please confirm that these changes are acceptable. 
 Mike, I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit "C" and "D" are acceptable.  They did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read $1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants making a change.    "Mike Cesario" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/12/2000 10:53 AM 
 Ellen, One more thing, when the deal is confirmed, it should be confirmed as an Houston Pipe Line Company deal.  If you have any questions please call me, Barbara Gray or Jeff Hodge.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 12/12/2000 10:42 AM 
 Please read 5&6 plus appendix 
 Contract changed as requested.  I have had Jenny print 2 contracts and 2 transaction agreements for you. 
 Doug, As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply Agreements.  The document that he forwarded to me does not define the agreements that he wants you to certify as to.  They are vaguely referred to as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.  As far as I know, he may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.  If they get back to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as such term is defined.  I will let you know what Larry is able to modify. 
 FYI. 
 So you do check your mail.  Yes, I am doing this.  I ordered my equipment yesterday.  I went with the Advanced Desktop.  The difference was $333.  I also paid for additional upgrades of speed and memory.  Call me if you want specifics.  It works best if you use the telephone line when ordering, at least that is what the Dell representative sold me on.    Stacy E Dickson 12/14/2000 10:50 AM 
 Debra, Please prepare another Master.  Deal should be identical to the one we did for your buddy.  That one was between ENA and ECT Merchant Investment Corp. This one should be with Brazos VPP Limited Partnership, a Texas limited partnership, and ENA. Check with Teresa regarding the ownership of Brazos.

 Kim, I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC. Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy should be sufficient. Don't you agree.    "Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 12/15/2000 03:35 PM 
 Jeff, I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal. She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of default. If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed. 
 Christian, If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of your address for Invoices. 
 Christian, Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.  Please print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the purchase order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring the number from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed copies to me or Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.     "Pfister, Christian W." <CWPfister@cps-satx.com> 12/15/2000 04:16 PM 
 fyi 
 Christian, I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is not a Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day. Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you agree?    "Pfister, Christian W." <CWPfister@cps-satx.com> 12/15/2000 05:48 PM 
 Please review the below and lets discuss if this really works. 
 Count me in.    Legal Temp 1 12/18/2000 03:03 PM 
 Brad, Please have them add a provision providing that the agreement shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of execution by Enron North America Corp.  Otherwise the agreement is acceptable as written.    Bradley Diebner 12/18/2000 01:33 PM 
 Mike, I am forwarding this to you.  If you are not the person helping Wade with this, please forward to the person in your group who may be. 
 Lauri, I have talked with Gerald and have no information that he is not aware of. Sorry that my memory isn't better about the intent of the language relating to state facilities.    Lauri A Allen 12/19/2000 10:57 AM 
 Please review the language in 87crfm.  Call me after you have had a chance to read.  If okay, I will print on letterhead so that it can be resent to the counterparty. 
 Mike, I have added the language as item 4 under Other to the Transaction Agreement.  If okay, please accept the changes, print, have signed and forward to me for further handling. 
 Ellen, Please review the attached modified documents to see if it correctly reflects the deal.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 12/20/2000 02:59 PM 
 Yes    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 12/20/2000 05:13 PM 
 Use this one please. 
 Dave, I expect to be available most of the day on Tuesday and Wednesday.   I am in EB3863, however, please call me at ext. 36895 to make sure I am not out or in a meeting before you come up.    Dave Fuller 10/12/2000 07:11 PM 
 Jenny, Please print the two crestar documents on ena stationary twice each and send to Grant Oh as requested in Barry's email.  Thank you. 
 FYI 
 Both of the above documents have been updated.  If any additional changes are needed, please advise. 
 Send me the contract so that I can determine if we guaranteed no free liquids.    Gary W Lamphier 12/21/2000 02:18 PM 
 Veronica, The above guaranty agreement as modified can be used.  Please get with Tenaska to fill in the $amount and the term.  Call if you have any questions.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 12/20/2000 12:32 PM 
 Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor. Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages. Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I receive it. 
 Leslie, I have reviewed the product descriptions for the natural gas products on Dynegydirect and they appear to be standard descriptions which should be easily understood by our traders.  As such, I am comfortable with such descriptions.    Leslie Hansen 12/22/2000 11:28 AM 
 I think this is the one. 
 The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction. 
 Ellen, Is this what you are talking about.  If so, I prepared this amendment so that we could get out of a bad trading position.  The customer had the right to use first of the month pricing on volume swings.  I believe that Lee Papayoti did the deal.  Gary Chapman with Union Carbide indicated that the deal is done, however, we are waiting on signatures.    Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 01/02/2001 03:43 PM 
 Russell, We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.    Russell Diamond 10/13/2000 10:11 AM 
 The contract is attached,  Please ignore their requested changes cause I did not agree to them. The credit worksheet was prepared by Russell Diamond as of 10/01/99. 
 Christian, I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.    "Pfister, Christian W." <CWPfister@cps-satx.com> 01/02/2001 11:31 AM 
 Bob, Please review the suggested modifications to be made to the previously sent confirmations for the above parties with regard to volumes to be processed at the Lowry Gas Plant in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  If you agree, please have revised confirmations issued that would be in place of the previously sent confirmations.  Please note that I only made changes to the price and quantity to reflect the deal as reviewed with Nelson Ferries and Charlie Otto.  Please call if you have any questions. 
 Bob, Please use the language in this version.  I needed to modify to cover where we were selling.  Call if you have any questions. 
 Charlotte, Happy New Year!  Hope you had an enjoyable Christmas holiday season.  Can you please let me know the status of the proposed amendment? 
 Brodgette. Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?  *****************************************************************************
