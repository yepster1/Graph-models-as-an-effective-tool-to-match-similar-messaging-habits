[Tigger](#i/tigger) **"You don't have a choice, son."**Not joking.

http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=206285460Not sure where I'm claiming that we're like those teams at all. I simply said I'd be impressed if anyone keeps ND under 28 points this year.

&gt;Texas

ND had 38 with almost a full quarter to go against Texas before the backups were put in to just get some time. Keep all of the starters in and let's see what would have happened for a couple more possessions. A couple more possessions with the starters, and that's 50, given how well ND was handling them. Anybody can cherry pick a score/stat to serve their argument. You'll notice I hardly ever quote stats alone, that's for a reason.

&gt;without facing a defense with our size or athleticism

I'd also say that, regardless of their troubles right now, athletically alone Texas matches up with almost all defenses quite well, primarily in their front 7.

You have Shaq Lawson at DE and they have Naashon Hughes, you have Watkins at DT and they have Hassan Ridgeway. You have Ben Boulware at LB, they have Malik Jefferson. *That being said, I'm not saying they're better overall. Texas is still a FAR nowhere near your front 7 right now.* Your starting front 7 is great, I get that.

However, don't expect me to concede that Clemson has some "athletic edge" over ND or have players "unlike anything ND has seen" in any specific position...especially given how long some of our starters have been here, which includes some since 2012. This part of the conversation needs to end (which I thought was reserved for TCI and TigerNet). I get it, you're athletic on defense, but you're not about to "wow" a team that plays the defenders of USC and Stanford every year, coupled with Michigan State up through 2013's defense, who have/had some of the most athletically gifted defenders in the country (especially up front). Throw in playing FSU last year, too, with their great secondary.

Frankly, if anyone has been "acting like they're reminiscent of 2013 FSU", it might be Clemson fans when they talk about their defense. You know, the one that lost almost everyone in the front 7 and all their depth from last year, because let's be honest...you have very little depth defensively unlike last year's ridiculous unit. We don't *know* too much about your defense yet, really, because the best offense (and offensive line) they've played has been Louisville...who is...questionable at best right now.

I'm not saying that I don't think they're great. From what I've seen, they are a VERY solid unit, but this probably isn't as good as it's being sold.

&gt;GT

In regards to GT...that was first full game for the new starting QB. It usually takes a little time to generate a rapport with the WRs. Also, almost ALL of the prep focus for this game would have been defensively (which I didn't think was much of a secret at this point), not the offense, and just having Kizer "manage the game". It showed on the field...save for inside the last minute. Regardless of their offensive woes, GT also has some solid stars in their secondary as well, just like Clemson.


&gt;UVA

In regards to the UVA game...if we don't lose Malik, the playbook stays the same and I'd be willing to almost guarantee we don't have to pull a last-second score to win, we score about 40, and they struggle to keep up. That being said, that's not what happened, so we don't know for sure. Either way, if you go back and re-educate yourself on this game, ND started rolling in the 3rd quarter until his injury, with 14 unanswered that quarter alone, the play his injury happened on was inside the red zone (or close to it)...set up for the 2nd TD that quarter. UVA were scoreless in the 2nd half until the fourth, the momentum had shifted...until that injury. Luckily Prosise delivered immediately after that.

This UVA thing is like the 2012 PITT conversation all over again.

&gt;in a truly hostile environment

You're 1-2 vs ranked opponents in the last 3 years at home (and didn't play a single ranked opponent last year at home). It's not as threatening as you've making it out to be *as of late*, nor is it going to be something that's going to be so insane that it'll knock the socks off ND players given their experience (outside of the QB position). Before you respond with "He's a freshman!" Yeah, and so was Jameis Winston. But, Winston did well because he had a solid surrounding cast, as does Kizer. I get that Clemson's environment is amazing, and I fully look forward to seeing it hopefully next year, but I'm not *too* worried about the environment (although still concerned), especially since we have a solid run game that can take the pressure off the QB if/when he has some issues. The environment isn't going to be anything new for anyone on the OL for ND (eh, save for perhaps Quenton Nelson), which is the most important component that allows the offense to run. Couple that with the experienced WRs (Brown since 2012), and a RB who is in his third year.

&gt;The one outlier is against a team that is actually ranked lower, according to sangarin, than some FCS teams, including wofford incidentally

Are you really using Sagarin rankings as a source this early in the season? Come now.

If you've made it this far, all I am trying to do is pass the time until this game.4.4**2**

:3IIRC yeah he was the dude chasing the returner down...hilarious to watch him catching up to him towering over the guy.Most of the "they can't match Clemson's athletic ability" stays in the Clemson boards. *Most* of it.[Clemson/UL One Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fPfyh6wRJc)WE ALL KNOW I CAN'T SLEEP UNTIL I GET ALL OF THE CLEMSON OUT OF ME FIRST
[What I think when I hear "Hurricane Joaquin"](http://www.nbapassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Noah.jpg)

I *really* hope this doesn't fuck this game up.That's also what preparation well before the season even starts will do for you.No, you don't understand. He's SLOOOOOOOOOOW. /s

^^^And ^^^its ^^^'"err" ^^^on ^^^the ^^^side ^^^of ^^^caution.'It's okay. we'll replace it with some Irish this weekend.

*^^Shh, ^^Only ^^dreams ^^now.*What, no star?Apparently once he saw Clemson, he was sold. (part of this was mentioned in an interview with him earlier this week, I believe) I get it, given all the good things I've heard about the campus, etc. Also, that crowd environment is clearly heads and shoulders above ND, although hopefully ND's gets better here soon with the additions.&gt;  I suspect a blowout and I don't know which way it will go.

Well, this is fucking terrifying.^^^I ^^^mean, ^^^we ^^^struggled ^^^with ^^^UVA ^^^when ^^^we ^^^probably ^^^shouldn't ^^^have, ^^^starters ^^^or ^^^not.What is this a 4H fair? Ribbons are stupid!I know it's early, but is there any word if he plans on sticking for 2016 or leaving after this year?Imagine how we felt in the prediction thread.That really literally doesn't matter once the teams hit the field. :pDamn bro. I love Rocky Top, but damn.Since you guys freaked out a while back when people used a capital 'S' for Deshaun's name, I thought I'd point out that it's actually DeShone.

Also, if the weather fucks this game up, I will be supremely disappointed. [One of the path projections from TWC looks somewhat promising](http://i.imgur.com/z8eTn4Q.png)1. Fair enough. 

2. Fair enough.

3. It's important to note that two of those losses came after the injury issues began on defense last year, and one of them was the FSU game. And like the three others were with Tommy Rees at the helm, and they were still quite competitive, being the @UM, @PITT (which we were probably robbed of with Tuitt ejected), and @Stanford.

4. I was mainly speaking to the point about how the environment might phase a younger QB, which is something that's been pointed out time and again. Winston hadn't really played anywhere threatening before they arrived in Clemson in 2013 (@PITT and @BC were the only away games before Clemson in 2013). So I wasn't necessarily speaking to his level of capability so much as confidence/poise.

5. No, and it's bullshit.

&gt;Also just so you know my prediction is 27-20 ND.

That's not how this works. You're supposed to tell me that you win by 3 TDs.

&gt;I also think Yoon misses another PAT.

God dammit.Please, no more. I can't take it being delayed or the weather postponing it outright.Meh, at least it's not Golston. Literally adding sounds into the name.This is how most people feel about Michigan/OSU, too.No, be sure to remind Dabo it's Wofford.It's a little funny because they already abbreviate his name on tickers, so he shows up as "Le Fournette".Whew, so we're playing the lesser known brother of Mackensie Alexander and not the real deal. Good to know.[TWC has this path of the storm right now on their site](https://i.imgur.com/z8eTn4Q.png), so that might bode well, if it actually takes that northward turn.Well, that depends on flooding, I'm sure, too. There's a point where you just cannot play with all the water. If there's anything ND knows about, it's shitty grass conditions.It's important to note that you're comparing internet conversations with random people to knowing someone in real life directly in your anecdote. Internet conversations tend to always get a little....weird, no matter who you are talking to.

And yes, I realize I can be on of the (if not the most) annoying ones.ND/Clemson has a hurricane bearing down on it, quite being bitches.

LOL, I just looked, why was this game scheduled as a night game anyway? There's literally no reason it ever should have been in that time slot.Whose (brand) is it?http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1873523/jmhurt_medium_medium.gifIt works quite well if you have no expectations. If only I could get myself back to that frame of mind.I don't even know who that is.I had a feeling. Their sauces can be really great as marinades, too.Yes. Hopefully it avoids Clemson, SC.Literally weather.com a little while ago. We'll see if it holds. This other dude just linked another projection that shows more potential paths.

Short week excuses or not, your offense looked anemic at best against Louisville, and ND's front 7 is heads and shoulders above them, ESPECIALLY at Linebacker.

ND should very well be good enough on both sides of the ball to win the trench battle, pretty much the most important part of the game, given your weak OL and ND's strong OL (everyone can point to the UVA game, but it's not like we played Wofford and AppSt for our other two games so that's the only game we have. Watch the OL against Texas and GT, too, if you want to be informed). The only thing that would allow for a 10+ point win would be ND not applying ANY pressure at all against your questionable protection of Watson (which isn't going to happen with BVG), your OL playing 5 times as well as they have been, and if ND can't do literally anything on offense...which is just hard to believe with all the weapons and this protection, new QB or not.

I care. &lt;3 Clemson Buses.The fucked up part was just HOW LONG that game was delayed by watching players get/sit on buses...only to have the outcome be what it was. If they didn't harp on it so much before that game's outcome, I don't think anyone would remember it.

edit: delayed was a bad word to use, the start of the broadcast was like 8pm, but it took another 15 or 20 for the game to actually kick off with the build up.Yeah, I should clarify what I meant. The start time of the broadcast was like 8pm, and a good 15-20 minutes was spent on the lead-up and the buses. It was just terrible waiting for that game to start.HAHA, I HAD NO IDEA.

I WONDER WHAT THEY"RE GIVING THEM NOW. /sWhen did he mention how nervous he was?WTF, weird I guess I missed it.Indeed. Usually though the ABC games have kicked off relatively early on into it, though./r/CFB literally has a prediction thread every week.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/wiki/weeklythreadsAh. Meh I'll check it out again and see if I've seen it and just glossed over what he said.

Either way, I'm definitely a little concerned. Hopefully they can set the tone early on by really avoiding too much passing and get Prosise the ball, or a screen or two. That or just bomb it out there to see if a receiver can catch it, giving him some confidence in his throwing. Not that I really expect that to work very well against their secondary.Oh I stay completely disconnect during ND games.

Go Dawgs.[Me Right Now](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljd4ufMzqN1qixleeo1_400.gif), given this news

[Me about this game](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m90axdNjkh1qlizbi.gif)I'm more worried that the time is changed and they don't televise it, somehow. I'm just fucking nervous about everything, hence the constant talking about it.The AAC is far closer to that level than the MAC.He's still coached by Al Golden, though.Finally a voice of reason.At least half of the shit I say on /r/CFB.Indeed. This week they're practicing on grass...and doing the whole "piping sound into practice" thing to simulate the crowd (the played the War Chant over and over last year, IIRC, during practice for FSU). The last game ND played on grass was...fucking UVA. If we play that poorly, I will not have a fun night.Thanks, Ollie.

:(Ah, you're one of *them*.Until Joakim Noah fucks all the east coast game times up.It's amazing to me how some people seem to forget so quickly what losing your starting QB can do to a team. After all, a fair number of Clemson fans talked like if they had issues with Watson again they'd be *lucky* to go 6-6 this year.

If Malik doesn't go down against UVA, with the way the offense was clicking in the 3rd, it was a whole different game. ND scored twice that quarter, the second of which was set up in part by the run that injured Malik, and held UVA to zero points all quarter. They had the momentum, and it was completely taken away by a freak season-ending injury to the starting QB. The team folded in the 4th once they were completely deflated, but managed to stay alive with the last minute heriocs. If you think that automatically means anything about your game against a team that's now had time to prep their new QB and played two full games in between, then you haven't been watching CFB all that long.

I love how the UVA game has already quickly become the 2012 PITT game to every "neutral" fan out there in any conversation about ND.

&gt;Heim has never been accused of aiding Sandusky or convicted of wrongdoing. But he struck a nerve three years ago when he admitted that he advised the charity's chief executive not to report Sandusky's showering with children to the charity's board.

Jackass confirmed. I get that he was awarded a Bronze Star, but much like the line "I respect the rank, not the man" line prevalent throughout military circles, "I respect the medal awarded, not the man."

**Please, FFS, don't go directly harassing PSU fans about this as if it's their fault.**This might sound like a silly question, but I've been looking for a decent mic, I noticed on Amazon there are two types of MX 990 models, one says 990 and the other has an "s" on the end "990s". Is there a difference?Between the initial allegations way back when it first came to light for PSU (I admit I cracked a joke or two in bad taste during a drunken night), harassing Baylor fans about the BSU transfer, and the harassment of FSU fans with Winston/Jimbo, not to mention certain...past incidents...that random people feel the need to remind ND fans about, I've grown extremely tired of that garbage on /r/CFB when it comes to this kind of stuff. At one time, this place was, for the most part, better than that. Things like this should never be thrown in the faces of fans/students of a team/school, as it's not anything they probably had direct control over/knowledge of, and it's also extremely hurtful as you never know who may have relationships with victims/those involved or just who might take certain serious issues like this to heart.

Unfortunately, this is what also comes with a higher membership count, and internet conversations in general. Good with the bad, etc.To be fair, people have been saying that every year and every year they seem to bounce back from the single loss. I said they'd go 9-3 this year. Who knows. It's going to take a couple teams that are strong enough up front to protect their QB to set up a passing game that takes advantage of Bama's somewhat questionable secondary. UGA might have great QB protection, but it's possible that the weather may screw up their chances of putting the ball into the Bama secondary, so we'll see how that plays out this weekend.No.To be fair, nobody really got riled up about it. It was just funny.That is quite nice.ND/Clemson:

&gt;"It'll be a tie"

\u0ca0_\u0ca0Skill positions were already questionable coming into the season. Sucks for Snoddy, too, as he was returning from injury already. Hope he gets back soon.Not all that surprising, really. A lot of "military recognition" (ceremonies, purchases, etc) is just thinly-veiled bullshit. For instance, you're never going to convince me that selling these stickers for one's car with "We Support Our Troops" on it *actually* means that military members are getting the help they need from those proceeds.And once it's finally over, you'll only hear about it for another 5 years or so because people like to dredge up the past.Any rumor as to how they'd do the TV coverage, if so? Like, would this trump the other ABC game? I'm really fucking paranoid about missing this game.In the words of yourself: DIE.

:DTo be fair, that does mean that there would be less rain potentially on the ground, depending on how long it rains for.[This was 4 hours ago on USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2015/10/02/clemson-officials-school-able-to-operate-game/73201422/), but I don't think they're operating with any new information in this article.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.He doesn't even know Jayron's first name. BOOO. /s

This is great. Also, Kizer never said anything, lol.

&gt;Put the house payment on that thing

Isn't that what they said during the broadcast with that angry Clemson fan, like he spent his rent or something?It's spellout time!

CGame time doesn't dictate Gameday. They've had 330 ABC games get Gameday in the past, IIRC, too.And to think I liked UGA.[This tweet says there's going to be an announcement at 4pm](https://twitter.com/TigerFanForum/status/650022147918794753)Yeah, I'd rather not go down that road of a conversation today, not to make light of the situation.I heard Stubhub, etc was pretty good about guaranteeing tickets, so I wonder if they'd make up for it in this case. Then again, "act of god" with the weather, and I do think they have some kind of "no guarantee" clause somewhere.On Twitter someone said an actual official decision was being made at 4pm today.To be fair, that's actually less than it was this morning at 100%, IIRC,I worded things poorly in my excitement.[Gameday Guide from ClemsonTigers.com](http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28500&amp;ATCLID=210388211)Nice try. Not going to work.Some people just need a punch in the dick.It's just like calling your Congressman!I'd say incompetence is just highly prevalent throughout all levels of society.I can't believe I'm considering tuning into a game just to see someone get booed.He's pretty much the sole reason why I hate UCF. I'm slowly letting go of that hate.Maybe. What's the catch?Ranch and buffalo sauce. Together? For some reason by brain finds that crazy. I'm not the best cook, though.

Also, my crock pot isn't that big, but I think I can fit pretty much all of that into it.I keep forgetting about spinach artichoke dip, but I fucking love that shit whenever at a bar.Sweetness. Now to find buffalo sauce in this store tonight...Red wine, I assume?This was great.That's the problem. They didn't think.Just a few of the reasons:

- Biggest away game for ND all year

- Biggest home game for Clemson all year (most likely, even though it has no conference implications)

- Possibly bigger/better environment than FSU or OU for ND as well.

- Not like we're playing next year, either. The next game is 5 years away in 2020.

It all makes perfect senseProbably one of my stalkers.Welp, the spinach/artichoke dip is done that /u/AuBears recommended and /u/dubsdcarson's dip is in the crockpot.

Now I'm sipping bourbon, which I haven't done in a long time, but decided to pull out the bottle of Eagle Rare I have.My favorite bourbon will probably always be Old Pogue. Scotch is my main sipping whisky, but while I was in the liquor store, the guy mention ER, so I grabbed it. The nice thing about bourbon is it's also not as expensive as some of the scotch I usually drink.Indeed. Had that single barrel once or twice. Not bad at all.I never once used the word "open" or "letter" in the entire post. I'm sure of it. Given that, I can neither confirm nor deny that this post is in fact an "open letter".I'm looking for an available cock, but it seems there are none available as South Carolina is too busy sucking far more than I could ever dream of.

^^jk ^^&lt;3Yeah, I expected as much. Ah well.Did I just stay awake all night?

*checks clock*

WTF. Why /u/CFB_Referee WHY?!I mean, ND and Navy were rivals all 43 years of the streak.

Also, not everyone cancels just because they lose. :pI can't hear you over Rocky Top. :'(Ahh, Convicts.The puffy shirt sells it.Ahh, Bertram.Comfy and dry.I'm supposed to be in bed, but fucking Diaco insists on forcing me to keep watching...making me think they have a chance. Miss you Bobby D.Don't watch Baylor/TTU tomorrow.


erm..today.Motherfucking SERIOUSLY? It was right fucking there...out in the open. SERIOUSLY.THERE'S STILL HOPE!\u0ca0_\u0ca0*silently fumes*That touchdown was a real punch in the nuts.I'm still mad.Game over if you don't get the 4th.It will totally be the first fanbase I've ever offended as a whole on /r/CFB.LOL @ trying to frame your toddler as a recruit.Just tell them scoring = alcohol.That's the thing, if they think two weeks is "old news". I have news for them as an ND fan...Weird, I wasn't paying attention. I'm going to need proof.No keep pushing him in the face well after the play is over, that's fine.This year's Utah team would absolutely murder BYU...and it would be glorious.Just them, though, right?Exactly how I want it.Oh, it's not just me.Score doesn't accurately reflect how close this game was.Oddly True.Vols fan in me: Hahahahah :'(To be fair, Diaco did coach at ND before he arrived at UConn, so perhaps that trait came with him.FYI, unless it's my browser, somehow you didn't link to the beginning. (as I now see your comment)

Anyway, that was intense. I said I wasn't going to jerk off tonight.[Does this link work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH1t1NRZ58o)I found it through the youtube search function just as a test. It's not the same as the URL you got. Now that I look, there's something in your OP link that mentions "46" which I assume means where you start it. Where'd you get the link? Did you search it on YT or get from somewhere else? Perhaps that's what is going on.

"t=46" is what I'm referring to in the OP URL.We found your problem. :pShit's on fire. Just another night in Morgantown.I can't advocate enough....if you really want to learn...hit up the full games on youtube, etc (/r/cfbuploads). (and play the NCAA game, too, as a supplement)

You'll learn players, tendencies, packages, and everything as long as you pay attention. Anyone can rattle off stats, not everyone can confidently tell you how one unit compares to another, how one lineman might react to a blitz, if a QB is  capable of picking up and sidestepping a rusher, all sorts of things you just don't see in statistics.They said just a bit ago that earlier on it should be better, but the second half could be worse. So, given that, they may still get to run down. I'm sure they're also paying attention to that to be sure it's safe, too. Wonder if they have it covered, though.Yeah it's real grass.Can confirm 2005 was disappointing as fuck.No. Sure we don't play them anymore, but I was extremely upset to see how things went with Michigan. Also, given ND's own experience with terrible administration/decision making...it hit a little close to home. Rival or not, these are still kids playing a game they love, and they should all be given the best chance to win. That being said....some days I feel differently.&gt;I don't think uniforms impact performance


ND's green jerseys disagree.BOO SPURRIERWas going to say, the most Georgia thing ever would be beating Bama and then losing to the Vols. While I'd enjoy the Vols win, it's just crazy like that with UGA for some reason and it's frustrating as someone who kinda likes them. (part of the reason I like UGA is probably because this kind of stuff reminds me of ND in a way, too)Random, but do you have multiple usernames? IIRC, there are at least two Clemson fans with Taco-themed names.The glove didn't fit."DeShone Kizer punts in Madden".I'm...aware of that. :pThat would piss ME off. But, it WOULD be hilarious if they fell *with nobody getting hurt*, just taking the life out of the team.WTF does "the Irish will find more than TOS" mean? (it's a sign, people, just asking what it means)

edit: now I get it.All that after the 10 minutes of showing them on the buses. :pAhhhhh, now that makes more sense.Bruh, your Game Thread game is on point today.Please everyone pick Clemson

Please everyone pick Clemson

Please everyone pick Clemson

*fingers crossed*NO HE'S PICKING CLEMSONIT'S THE NOT-SO-FAST, IT'S THE NOT-SO-FAST!

HE'S PICKING CLEMSONBUT DEATH VALLEY!!!!! IT'S CLEARLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TEAMS ON THE FIELD!IT'S CLEARLY A NOT SO FAST!Holy shit The Orange Pope.Wait until tonight.NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!


edit: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Something about a girl in a bar, so he picked Clemson.Everything is against Catholicism. So, basically, do whatever you want.I mean, I can't disagree. I'm easily swayed by girls in bars, too.I...completely forgot about that. It has "CLEMSON" spelled down it, too, right?Just Heard Texas got a safety on a punt. I'm impressed.That's exactly what happened to me.Good for you, good for you.Jesus, if this continues, this is gonna be far worse than the ND/Texas game.As a Vols fan, they're nowhere near as bad as Texas right now.Uhhh-huh.That fucking douchebag. And I don't even like Texas.If he doesn't get a third year, they're shooting themselves in the foot.At UL, Strong had two rough years, and then mad the jump in the third once his own guys had more experience. I'm fully expecting a similar thing to happen for them next year.

This isn't Strong, this is what they did to themselves by allowing Mack to ride the ship to the ocean floor.To be fair, he typed it.Aaand it's fourth.This time it's really True, as Strong is playing the youngest guys over the experienced ones if the older guys don't prove themselves as a "cut above". So, starter-wise in a bunch of positions, he's starting literally from square one.Aside from "it's Texas", what are you basing that off of, because the actual recruiting rankings would disagree as of late. 2014 they were 16th, though 2015's class was better at 9th.And 6-7 last year.

Not exactly that far off, if you're within a single win of the same record.Right, now consider that he's playing with mostly the youngest guys. And winning doesn't come easy with that age deficiency. You're not going to end up with a full class of game-ready freshmen. It's rare that you land more than a couple who are comfortable seeing starting time this early into their careers. He's playing with those guys to help build the team for the future. It's not an easy process, but it should be pretty simple to understand.As a fan with intimate experience with administrations and coaches fucking shit up, in ND, you can't just change that shit overnight. It takes time. So age of the players, etc. also factors in, especially if they're operating with older guys who feel entitled just because they're at Texas, which is one of the other cultures Strong is trying to change.

I fully believe that we'll have a much tougher game with them to open 2016, and that, in the next few years, other Texas teams will be shocked. That is, if they don't make more dumb administrative decisions.

edit: some words.Sucks because all these young guys are just getting pummeled right now.I'd say there are a few offenses capable of doing it and TCU would be one of them.And ND was a CFP team after their mauling of Texas, too. I remember the game after that.People laugh right now, but wait until Malik Jefferson has a year or two under his belt. He may not be Jaylon, but he'll be a monster."Maybe TCU doesn't come back in the second half."HOLY SHITLately I fell like a lot of special teams units have been underwhelming.Thanks, Captain Obvious.You've...changed...since last night. :pSo, this means away teams are going to win big tonight, right? 


Pls.Good news, they have a FG.Sweet. (I hope you're not lying to me.)I demand sacrifice for that BS against my Vols. Good luck, UF, you're gonna need it. :pI don't want to be fair! I just want the streak to end!\u0ca0_\u0ca0

Football is stupid.Apparently the higher-ranked away teams are winning today. *cough*

edit: I forgot Bama was lower ranked than UGA.Georgia, you disappoint me.A fan of my third favorite team is being mean.Yeah, I've said countless times that's kinda why I think I sort of like UGA...it's....familiar to me.Already talking about basketball."By the roar of the crowd you thought it was against OSU"

That's because there's more OSU fans than IU fans.I pick me being scared.:(They weren't going to the game anyway.OSU/IU is a fucking shootout now. What.I have been waiting for this game for fucking years at this point. And my nerves reflect that accurately.We're not that good. You have nothing to worry about.Most of them have had a similar sentiment, as it can cause issues with their passing game, which is the strongest part of their offense over the run game.To an extent. Artavis Scott is very dangerous and can run reverses and end arounds that don't require the need for long passes, as can most of their other guys. Screens as well still apply. Their bread and butter for the most part (regardless of weather), with Williams out, is the shorter passing game anyway.Yeah, he's sick.This helps ND. But, at the same time, a lot of the ND fans just aren't able to make it down, too, from what I've been hearing.It wouldn't be Clemsoning even if they lost.*Cheers.*Is...is that like a pool hall?This is great news for everyone.Nice. Sucks that where I'm at they got rid of the best pool hall. Used to play a lot myself when I went out a lot.Would.It's become annoying and basically a circlejerk at this point.I'm nervous that I'm not nervous enough now. What the fuck is going on?!Except for the last part, good for you!Alright bros. I'm getting off of here and everything else electronic for the game. Hope everyone has fun at least.

GO IRISH, BEAT CLEMSON!I'm not even mad. That was amazing. Great game, Clemson, all over the field. QB run may have been a bad-ish call, but it's easy to say that now. Great. Game. That's all that matters.BRB, on my iPad.I mean, Clemson basically owned the entire first half and a bit of the third quarter as well.Who would've thought the rain would favor Clemson. :pI mean, they're receivers, not running backs. There's so much other stuff to spend your time on that "ball security" drills. So, I understand it. Ah well. Either way, they fought back in the 2nd half, and...to be fair....Clemson looked fucking insane, especially on defense, most of the first half.Even I was pissed about that. He's a cool dude and was great post-game. Can't wait to see the next dance.Yeah, I don't get all the disdain for that call. That's....ironically...coaching 101.Fuller probably would have caught some things. It's crazy to me that the rain managed to seemingly favor Clemson. Ah well, just an awesome game.Let's be fair, Prosise is heads and shoulders above Bryant by a long shot. Bryant would have gotten completely murdered this game.2013, really, with Tommy.And to think ND has his son on a wall.Easy there, Paul Rhoads. :pIt's also that it took our QB and defense so long to finally adjust. Crowd did their job that game. The QB run definitely killed us, though, early on.I agree completely. It sucks that it took the defense basically as long as the QB to adjust to the environment, it seems.Yeah, lucky you. I was about to slit my wrists by the end of the 1st half. :pI said "basically", and with the way their defense played was the main reason why I say that.I get your point, but it's also easy to say that now. I dunno anymore. I'm not going to psychoanalyze it right now.I'm not even surprised. ASU pulls this shit every year. They play lights out one game and then fucking lose to a team like Oregon State. No offense to OrSt.

No, I'm not still pissed about last year. :pOk.He's a shorter GA3 in better physical shape with no speed. Bottom line: can't cut upfield, and that's not a trait you can have in a running back.I'm actually still in a decent mood. Let's not do this now before I have to buy new shit for my entire apartment...again.You could a little bit early on, but once they caught on...things were dialed in. For the most part, one of the biggest things was "keep Boulware out of the backfield" and they did that for the most part...his name wasn't really called. Without the weather, honestly, I think we hear Fuller's name a lot more, not that I'm saying that changes the score. I'm just happy they looked good after they figure it all out. Also, I'm surprised they weren't as ready as they should have been for the QB run, which should have been almost obvious.

Great game overall.Welcome to "weather games". One team typically gets luckier than another when the weather is the way it is. I'm not that mad, and nobody is going to tell me otherwise. I'll rewatch the entire thing tomorrow which will allow me to realize what was and wasn't truly terrible. The biggest thing is probably the fact that they should have been much more aware of the QB run early on of Watson.ND on NBC has been relatively bad as well so far. Multiple plays out of focus and shit all over the place.I'm just glad we finally remembered how to football a little bit later in the game.Now give yourself zero hindsight and less than roughly 60 seconds to make that call. Tell me again how simple it is.

Armchair coaching is an amazing thing to see.Lucky you. ND Football fans have a surplus of pacemakers in stock.And them having double the preparation time.Yeah, let's get rid of the best coach ND has had since Lou Holtz.Yeah he has a little bit of an attitude to him.That's not even fair. Talk about a softball.....I just looked it up, they fucking lost. What the fuck. (had to watch ND game so didn't get to see the rest of the Vols/Arky game)Literally. Like, now I kind of expect it.Yep. It's quite annoying to me how familiar the parallels between ND and the Vols are, specifically with the paying old coaches. I think Butch CAN deliver, but they REALLY need to deliver some solid depth in recruiting on the OL. Like, I say it a lot, but I'd love to see Hurd and Dobbs behind ND's OL. With that depth, that's what's been helping win games lately...save for tonight.Let's hope they also referred to Michigan's home stadium as "The Horseshoe".Same outcome: both teams lose.

:(I'm just waiting for this to blow up in Baylor's face.Mark Helfrich is a large reason WHY Kelly was so successful. I think they relied SO heavily on their QB/offense for so many years that this next offseason they're going to have to realize that more changes on defense are in order as well as diversifying looks on offense, perhaps lending even more focus to the run game.Many of those great players were actually recruited by Helfrich.Yeah, he missed a wide open man when he thew that one downfield to Corey. Meh, whatever. This is what comes with inexperience, too.I was thinking of you when I read that. As an ND and Vols fan, I'm disappointed today.All we have to do is not screw up against Navy next week after this big letdown in the 4th quarter. 

Should be easy. /s&lt;3 Purdue and IU...when we're not playing them.GG bro, it's been fun. Frankly, part of me is betting that the weather made the experience all that much better.So, Clemson without Chad Morris.

Hmm...I don't even care. I just want to see what we look like when it's not hurricaning outside.Yeah, I'm not shocked at all...especially given last year's game.I'll be a little miffed if GT wins this one.Not saying we could, but I can't wait to hear "remember what happened three years ago". Okay, go, I'm ready.As if things couldn't get worse.Just have to avoid the implosion like last year.Unranked. Wow. :(*Evanston*

 :pSeems like a lot of polls have ND around 15th. Disappointed, given all the weather stuff, but can't disagree. Next two games with Navy and USC will tell us a whole lot about the team.No, you actually lost. I haven't woken up yet.

*sobs*:DNow don't go fucking it up, please.I think they kinda got their "beat the crap out of someone" game out of the way with UGA.If you do, it would make me happy....especially IF we somehow manage to avoid an implosion and go something like 10-2.This is only IF ND can avoid an implosion like last year after a disappointing loss. I know players avoid looking at stuff like this usually, but perhaps it might be a good idea for the coaches to use this as motivation for them., to give them a bit of perspective so they realize that they're not completely out of it.I think it should be the goal every year. :3I'll say this, so far, though, outside of the Texas game, ND has yet to prove that they can play a full game.

UVA was...shitty all around.

GT they couldn't close out.

UMass was a shitty first half.

And then obviously coming out dead against Clemson.

I'd say this applies primarily to the defense, more than the offense, even.Ball handling in weather: F

Fast start ability: FMaybe, we'll see.~~"Savage" is a theme the team had, it had nothing to do with insulting Clemson. But nobody wanted to hear that at the time.~~


edit: Sorry, I misread that. I thought it said "can't believe Fuller got involved" or something. Yeah, a lot of times he just seemed to be forgotten. I guess maybe they just kind of "wrote him off" and decided to throw towards other guys.Well, Mack wasn't anywhere near him on a few (one specifically I remember off the top of my head in the middle of the field) where the ball went straight through his hands, I'll say that. Catching was just atrocious, and Kizer missed a few wide open guys a couple times. Not sure if he just didn't have line of sight, probably also due to Clemson's DL getting in the lanes.My brain isn't working this morning. Edited above."Savage" is a theme of the ND offense this year. So it wasn't really a direct "diss" on Clemson, though they played it up that way.Damn, Clemson is 4th and ND is 24th.Yeah, some have been saying "See you in South Bend next year"...kinda sucks they don't realize we have to stew for 5 years.If so, we really have no evidence of that yet. The issues on the field really weren't related to injuries of lack of depth.[Any day now.](http://41.media.tumblr.com/4cbad663d6d0b6604f507e9ce8d588a0/tumblr_nugwe6ZsTs1r2iinvo1_400.jpg)Opponents so far:

SMU, Lamar, Rice, TTU

Any remotely decent QB can put up those numbers against those teams with Baylor's WR corps, IMO. This is why stats alone in most conversations are a joke. They only tell part of the story.That dude is absolutely killer.http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/about-the-rankings&gt;Wrong Dooley, thank God. Carry on.

I almost had a seizure.All hail Robbie.ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEE!Best kicker in ALL THE LAND.[Me as the kick return played out...](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Shocked-Doc-Rivers.gif)Anything can happen.If there's one thing I'm sure of, this season hates everyone.Depends on the team. That's what I think.Us too. NOW carry on.Save this garbage for the offseason at least. Before the season started, they said that low-quality posts should be avoided. This is a perfect example of one of those types of posts.I don't need to be afraid right yet. Give me a least ONE day off.It's like 4 weeks into the NFL season. It has no basis in reality and brings up zero solid reasoning in the OP as to why he might come back to a CFB team. It's literally just a one-liner question.I figured at least one of your fans would dredge up a months-old post and pull this crap. :pI wonder who has the lone loss.I'd also add in that, apart from a few specific random plays, Kizer probably has better overall pass protection than OSU's OL. It's pretty ridiculous how good our line has been overall this year, even in the Clemson game after they settled in a bit.&gt; GT comes in big over Clemson

Should I want teams ND has beaten to beat Clemson, or should I want Clemson to win out? I'm so confused. I feel like I should want Clemson to win out. /r/CFBUploads 

Also look on Youtube after a day or two, specifically check out a channel called OneHourFootball, as they do well to put most big games up.I feel like they should have done everything to bring in great staff members underneath him for a few years, then groomed them to take over when he was done. But, I'm not sure what the feel/status is of his current staff might be right now.Unfortunately, "time" is the one thing they really don't have too much of with a coach of his age.If Clemson manages to get in, I don't think there's a way they allow ND as well, with an ACC school. The rest of the season would have to be REALLY convincing wins.I mean, I'm still in a little bit of pain wondering how this ND team is going to respond to the loss.:(
Nice try.They did it before the season started, talking about like the "top 26" ot "top 28" teams, too. Whatever, it is what it is at this point.Throw JFF in there, though, for whatever he equals, too. They went way overboard on their coverage of him as well.Clemson is basically an SEC team, right? :(Also Bama has better wins than ND so far.Don't overlook fuckin' Navy, please. Also, as I've said elsewhere, this team has yet to prove they can play four quarters yet outside of the Texas game.The minute everyone starts telling you how great you are is the time to be even more worried.You cheated by dialing up a hurricane.Oh my god, I can't even recognize you anymore. How long will you be like this?Finally someone understands. :pUtah fans are a realistic bunch and most of them would likely agree. Good, someone has already said it.Whew. Was worried it might be terminal.That applies to...a LOT of major programs/blue bloods, at least to some extent.Beth Mowins.

Rod Gilmore.

Having either of them is how you know you're watching a lower to mid-tier football game.

---

Can I just say here that I miss the Herbie/Musberger combo?Verne is a goddamned treasure.I disagree. Brent being on the call was exactly how you KNEW it was a big game. That voice.Bullshit, ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top.it's not that even to me. It's just that she's SO insanely monotone, nothing to do with gender.Where was I complaining? All I was doing was stating a fact.Hahahahahahahahahaha.

*cries*Damn.GT was built up more by other fans than their own, being as they were "the flavor of the offseason" so to speak, kind of in a circlejerky manner.This is True, and part of that was reactionary to their bowl performance and their lines returning everyone aside from the lone replacement Devine. It seems most just assumed that they'd plug-and-play new skill position guys, too, without a hiccup...which is clearly not the case. Plus, Snoddy is out now, too. Their defense isn't quite what was expected either, given the experience in the secondary.IIRC would have made it a 10 point game, meaning you didn't need 2 TDs, only one and a FG. At the time, it was the right call.Equal parts both, but especially sadness.There's a lot of things tougher than Auburn.I'm a little scared.Where are people not considering Clemson for CFP contention?

As far as resume prior to this game, for ND...I'd say it could have been that, too. ND had beaten Texas, UVA, GT, UMass...where Clemson had beaten Wofford, AppSt, Louisville.I don't think anyone was hurt during UMass, either.IIRC, ND wasn't in the CFP "top 6" for more people BEFORE this game, either, so I'm not sure what to say (not counting a few /r/CFB polls). They were just outside, at like 7-8. Perhaps that's my memory, though.

I think you might be capable of winning it all. But, what's frustrating is, given the game's conditions, we still really don't know how good either team really might be, lol. So it's just "wait until next week' mode for the next few games. Plus, the depth concerns for Clemson at certain positions may become more apparent as the season wears on.

---

For the most part, regardless of what a few might say, ND travels very well and *most* try to act as if they're representing something greater than themselves. So, I would hope the experience was a good one. Same is True for when encountering visiting fans coming to South Bend.If the B12 champ is 11-1, 10-2 isn't getting in, then ND has a better shot...especially if it's Baylor with their schedule.

Frankly, though, as I've said before...I think it's undefeated or stars have to align to allow ND in.Ah right, I forgot about that.Good for you, man.Cut blocks don't really injure as much as the narrative suggests. Lately also Navy has been much better about it in the past few years.We have yet to see them play 4 quarters since the Texas game. That's what pisses me off.Haha. :(Oh, this is our weekly bitch about OSU being ranked #1 thread? There's like....7-8 games left.I love this clip. It can be used pretty much everywhere.Nobody. Why? Because everyone is pretty inconsistent right now. Until we see a string of games where a single QB can look truly convincing...it really doesn't matter.IIRC, literally nobody was open, either.They recovered well and almost came completely back. Kizer settled in later in the game as well. For the most part, the issues were on the WRs, not his throws being off or anything or really anything Clemson was doing. So for that type of environment being his first exposure to a full away game, combined with the weather, he did his job and I'm happy for that.Welcome to the new /r/CFB. (no, I'm not saying it's ALL bad, but certainly things have....changed...in the last year or two. It's still better than anywhere else.)I'm afraid for MSU. I'm really also banking on UM beating OSU as of right now.*"Find a quarterback and then we'll talk."*

-Things people didn't expect to hear about OSU this year.Anybody can catch someone's face for a split second to make them look awkward.

Well, except Barney Stinson.Well, so far word is Schmidt is pissed about their performance, so this might be bad for Navy. I'm hopeful.&gt;God damn it.

^^^Please ^^^win, ^^^Vols.Still undefeated in 2015, last I checked.Exactly. At this point, I'm about to give up discussing this. People don't seem to understand, perhaps because it's just so fresh.https://twitter.com/goalsetter21/status/651072205770461184So, can someone explain this "Joey Freshwater" phenomenon? I have no idea what it's a reference to.

edit: thanks, this makes much more senseOohh, I knew about the alleged booster relations, but had no idea about the fake name. This all makes much more sense now.Yours is worse.I like the S&amp;P+ rankings. I'll take those.

edit: holy shit, though, just noticed where other teams were. LOL OSU at 25.Everett GolsonI think some are still just not used to UL being ACC.Fournette vs UF's defense. Hnng. FUCK the ND/USC game is a night game, too.You have a good defense, I wouldn't be so sure.Now you've gone and done it.You are entitled to your opinion.

&gt;often times people are not equal fans of two teams

Right, which is why one comes first and one comes second. This argument doesn't even make sense.You can change it any time you want.Get rid of flair bets, too? LOL @ this guy.People will call people names anyway. Do what you want, and stare them straight in the face when you do it.Dude, stop, I'm dying of laughter here.

lol, I'm not even sure how to react to that.It's a representation of the rain from Saturday night. :(When I was most confident, that was well before we lost our starting QB and starting RB, and like 6 other major contributors.

It's funny to me, because one of your fellow fans decided to respond to a 2 month old comment I made after the game and poke fun. Well, that post was made well before we had the injury losses....because it was before the season even started. Probably even before Jarron Jones went down in fall practice.

And I'm always depressed about something or other, that's just ND Football.Which is why I said "most confident". I wasn't near as confident leading up to this game as I was earlier on. I alternated between "lol this is gonna be awesome" to "I'm afraid' given the fact that we had no idea what was going to happen.:oHey...shut it, pal.[Essential BYU tailgating gear.](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AIl0lMShL._SY300_.jpg)

^^^sorryND literally caused coaching changes, lol.They threw away from him, so it's not like he shut down all these pass attempts to Fuller. Also, Fuller had at least one or two which he dropped that he was wide open on, nothing to do with Alexander, one specifically standing out in my mind over the middle of the field, straight through his hands. That...COULD...have been after Mack went down for a bit, though, too.

Not saying he's not great, though, but this game left a lot to be desired.To an extent. A shutdown CB to me has more bearing on what he does WHEN he's targeted than when he's not, although obviously coverage plays into that. Not saying he's not great, and I realize you guys want to believe that he's the greatest CB in the country, so this may not be received very well here.I looked at the stats, but more important was I watched the game. Weather conditions like that ruin the passing game which favors the defender, not really allowing you to get a True handle on how the two match up. So I'm not about to anoint someone the "greatest CB in the country" (or that he actually shut down Fuller himself) after such a sloppy game. Again, he's perhaps one of the top CBs in the country, yes.Weather like this favors the defenders, so that's another reason why catches for Fuller were not as numerous, as well as just targeting others. He had at least one right over the middle of the field where a defender wasn't even to be found within 5 yards.Only loss is by 2 in a monsoon to now #5. Ranked 16th. :'(One of you guys have said this in every thread that pops up regarding players and Twitter. We get it, and it was a great idea. :pIf he's not careful, someone is gonna torch him and after the game they'll pull something like Lawson did with the "Savage" thing.I'm just in pain.I just think that the weather left a lot to be desired. The passing game for either team in weather like that ruins matchups and doesn't allow you to really get a proper gauge for the way players match up with each other.I'm done with this thread. I can't have a fucking conversation with you guys without just getting pummeled for it.Literally everything is opinion in here, including what biased Clemson fans are saying, so fuck off with the "you're not making any sense" shit.&gt;Notre Dame just kind of gets blown for being Notre Dame and that's it,

And for playing a tough schedule, and when they're winning against that schedule. But let's forget about that."Meet at the paw", IIRC. Basically, that's a thing where the students/fans join the players in the middle. It's done after every game, as far as I remember. and is to display like a continuity between students/fans and team? Meh, whatever, that's a horrible explanation.Sounds like cheatin', Pawl.[After this weekend, at least I won /r/CFB.](http://gorgview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dontgiveafuckspellingbee.gif)You used to be up there, too. :pThis was posted somewhere a bit ago. Can't find it right now.Yeah, I'm still figuring out my exit time/strategy here, and things aren't all that busy.I can just imagine Mack Brown sitting there cackling to himself quietly in a dark corner as this all plays out.They're not, just upvoting because of how absurd it is. :pShort answer: No.I have issues. And work is slow as fuck.To be fair, that's also because they've been doing it for quite a while, so this isn't some new "oh my god we won a game" rush of the field.Wish ND still allowed people to roam the field like after the Blue and Gold spring games back in the day. Used to be able to just run around the field grabbing player autographs as a kid.This guy.
"We're back!"

I've heard that phrase before...somewhere...2012 OU

Uhh, Snow Bowl Penn State, 1992? (attended)

Seeing a USC shut ND out 38-0 from field seats was...interesting. Was cool to be down there, though.I was almost expecting the Bud Light ND fan video.Seriously need this series reinstated ASAP.They said they had it saved, lol. Nah, I don't want to dredge up the past, to be fair to them. :pI remember talking about Iowa going undefeated last year, too.*throws things anyway*It's why ND dropped Michigan. /sI meant UM/ND.That's...unexpected. That said, maybe they realize they'd be complete fools to do so.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZrzg62Zj0So, what you're telling me is that previously seriously injured players are returning? Awesome.And they'll probably win by more.There's a username for that.JT's not going to get his game back if you don't give him the reps. Cardale's plateau'd, it's time to put the guy in who has a far higher ceiling (which we've actually seen, last year), so that he can get comfortable again. Urban is seemingly trying to do everything he can to appease both QBs and sides of the fanbase/argument, it seems, to the detriment of his team. Cardale is not a great QB and never was, doubly so for the system they are running. JT absolutely was a great QB before he went down, and needs to get back into the swing of things, and he also actually fits Urban's offense. Only one way to solve that problem.

Just my .02I love me some Nick Saban putting people in their place.

Did he ever address fans leaving early against Ole Miss when they still had a chance?Because ND blew up your lines.Bullshit. /sThis needs to become a thing.Looks a lot better than one might think with all that weather. Great shot of the field, too.Wait...they even call him Dabo Duck?They're a pretty good football program.That's awesome.

[This one?](https://twitter.com/dabo_duck)No, it was said a couple times before the season started in 2014, too.Dude, these were on ESPN segments and stuff, I don't exactly squirrel stuff like that away "just in case". It's just what I remember.:(Prosise was beating him before last Saturday, too. Unfortunately, we had to play Clemson's defense. :/Wait, didn't this conversation literally just happen last year?&gt;Notre Dame's Brian Kelly and Tennessee's Butch Jones are obviously using the same two-point conversion charts.

:(

I guess we're not completely out of it, which is nice.&gt; We as fans need to stop trying to prove that one back is better than the others based on meaningless, and i use that term extremely loosely, statistics. We just need to sit back on Saturdays and enjoy watching these players play.

No, you don't understand, my team's guy is better. This is important.Sanford who? \u0ca0_\u0ca0 Stay the fuck away. In all seriousness, what's the reason for his name popping up?
Uhh...yeah let's go with that.Off topic, but how did you like Ghana? And what was the arrangement of living there for a year specifically for?This sounds like the preseason hype train all over again.

thatsprobablythejoke.jpgHe's just overconfident because Golson hasn't had any turnovers yet. Just you wait...Exactly.I'm sure he'll be fine.

Hey...[trust me.](http://www.hollywoodoutbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/121.jpg)Yes, a chance...of raining interceptions.What the....they would be undefeated and have won their CCG. How could they not?To be fair, Michigan deserves this sentiment, Navy doesn't.I hate that we got so penalized for such a close game. I understand that we don't really have any good wins, though.Well, they're the "flavor of /r/CFB" right now, similar to how GT used to be. So I feel like that's part of the answer.OH yeah, third in 1-loss teams isn't bad.FYI, there's a Hawaii midnight ET game going on this week, too, vs SDSU.True, which puts things into a better perspective. I think I'm still just sad.That's just Purdue Football, though, to put that into perspective. That's literally what they do. They come out for one game or two a year to make someone look silly, and then kind of flounder the rest.. I'm pretty sure most OSU fans would also agree with that.Some people just don't understand. :p

[But at least it gave me my fondest memory of DaVaris Daniels](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1456470!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/irishweb15s-web.jpg)http://i.imgur.com/pb27baO.jpgI'm *really* doubting Jo right now. I have no idea what to expect from him this year. It'll be interesting to see how he plays into Hoiberg's system. Just saw that "bouncier" article, too. Hopeful that he's healthy and gets his game back.Christ, so many people dropping ND into the fucking 20s (for some it's just the way their polls work). Teens I get, but that's just absurd right now, especially if you're giving Clemson a top 5-7 spot.And while completely I understand that, they haven't exactly shown any GLARING weaknesses yet, to the tune that they're getting *killed* in one way or another each game. At least not something that says they're so far down that they're only deserved of something in the 20s. So while it's somewhat understandable to be cautious, so far they won until meeting a supposed top 5-7 team at their place, and nearly pulled that one off in ridiculous weather. Throw in that it was the most hostile environment we'll see all year with a new QB, too, as his very first full away game (only played part of the UVA game, obviously, and that was the only other away game).THEY S'POSED TO BE B1G.Depends on what he does *after* the win against FSU. If he flounders immediately after that, then it's just more of the same.Too quickly.

*sobs*I agree that there really isn't a signature win against a ranked team. But there's not too many programs right now with a signature win, it's not exclusive to ND. For example, what is Baylor's signature win? Are we really touting TTU as a signature win when they've played literally nobody else (far worse slate than ND so far)?

I get that there weren't any signature wins, but there weren't any other poor performances other than the UVA game, for the most part. Texas was killed, UVA happened. GT was owned almost all game, and UMass was taken care of after a slightly shaky start.

With regards to the UVA comparison (2014 UVA has now become the equivalent of ND's 2012 PITT game to everyone, it seems):

First away game (BSU had their BYU loss in Provo), which can play a part

New QB halfway through (as you mention, with Zaire going down)

Transitive property (that's what we're using when we go "look what BSU did to them")

First full game for new starting RB (Folston going down against Texas)

People continue to look at the single rough performance against UVA but ignore the other three handy wins. I guess that's just what we're doing now around here.No. The drive Zaire's injury happened on was when ND was up. His QB run that caused the injury helped in part to set up the 12 point lead. UVA didn't score a single point in the 2nd half until the 4th when everything changed and the team was...noticeably...different. The momentum had swung, and then...the injury happened.Without him getting injured that close game just doesn't happen. It was a different team in the 3rd quarter while he was in compared to the first half, the offense and defense both started stepping up in the 3rd quarter. The game just changed on a dime with the injury and when they had to adjust their playcalling to Kizer, which slowed the offense down, and the defense was noticeably deflated as well, letting UVA back into it with some ridiculous plays (like some unimpressive passes Johns completed, etc)Oh yeah, I know it'll rebound....IF they win these next two especially...against Navy and USC. They're going to need to be convincing, though.I'm really not. Their pass blocking was still pretty damned impressive and neutralized a lot of the blitzing threats you guys had. Their run blocking was the main question, especially early on, but I really think a lot of that was just being a little unprepared for the force of Clemson's starting linemen, given UMass was the team they saw last week. Now that they have that experience under their belts, I think it *should* be back to normal. How they handle whatever Navy and USC will throw at them will tell for sure.ND fans all try to be gracious hosts, for the most part, to any visiting fans. That's one thing that most ND fans IRL kind of pride themselves on (internet comments are a terrible indicator), how they interact with the visitors. We've had situations where we share our grill with visiting fans when tailgating sometimes, too.

I still have a that Utah Gameday shirt, somewhere.Yeah. Frankly, it was a bit surprising. He and our Center are the best two linemen we have, so I don't see any reason as to why they wouldn't bounce back. I'd say it was an aberration from the norm if we truly look at Stanley and how he has played over this and last season overall, which includes matchups against some arguably just as good (or potentially better) D-linemen.

The OL as a unit just did not come ready to play from the start, not to take away from Clemson who played their asses off, same with the DL. They're good enough that they *should* have owned both sides of the trenches, as most somewhat expected, but they just, rather inexplicably, didn't (I especially expected better for our DL vs the Clemson OL). Part of this could be due to the rest factor, as well as the environment. I don't think we pulled our starting linemen perhaps early enough vs UMass last week (but I could be remembering wrong), so that could have been part of the problem, too, where Clemson would have had a major advantage.

What I'm really intrigued to see is how you guys play next game, or if the "big win hangover" manages to catch your team off guard.So I'm guessing we're getting penalized for beating GT by only 8 points, then, and not 23. :(
25 is basically not ranked, to be fair.Ranked sadness.Going from a home game to playing @LSU is quite the punch in the dick, especially on such short notice.Isn't Minnesota also still like roughly 1/4-Notre Dame roster? Perhaps they're gotten rid of a few as of late, though.This is True.That's not how this works. Everyone is guilty upon first rumor.A couple more rebuilding years under a new coach can't exactly make it worse. Frankly, I'm kind of excited about the prospects. I guess not all angry Cincinnati coaches pan out.I'm already there. New coach, 10-2 next year with a win over Florida and Saban, win the East. Book it.Seriously. I was all excited as fuck coming down last year for the Bama game. I didn't expect a win, but I was happy to go. Plus, the rest of the fans were definitely excited as well.I don't need more disappointment. Frankly, may have been too many egos in the WR corps. I'm fine with the way things went without him....when they hold onto the ball, anyway.

LOL, it's going to take me a bit to let go of that fumble by Chris Brown, sadly, and I really like the dude as a player and what he brings to the team.Purdue plays ND, MSU, and OSU extremely well. I have no idea WTF is going on, but it always happens.Obviously, you shouldn't expect a coach to ever actually blame everything on a legendary coach that preceded them, publicly especially. That would be a terrible place to be, and then you wouldn't really be "owning" the current problems the program faces, which are your responsibility now.They're not worthless, but they're also not the only indicator of how great your team will be. Some teams, who shall remain nameless, do less with more on a relatively consistent basis.Typical arrogant ND fans.Kind of sucks for Illinois if they've got a few good candidates and then suddenly the Vols are throwing their hats into the ring again.There's a name for disguised Kiffin.Obviously, Auburn.Hope the rest of his life works out.What's the NCAA "BS" that Tunsil is being held out for?[Damn straight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKbOtWeAEnY)It's like these NCAA cats are just hiding in the bushes waiting for these players to have someone do them a favor.Isn't it because they have a lot of questions as to just how Ole Miss managed to make such a jump in recruiting relatively quickly, though?Uh, if ND has the mentality that we're losing undefeated teams quickly, and Navy is undefeated, that means ND is going to beat them.Also, Luatua was out, which I even completely forgot about. He was the better blocking tight end, overall.Texas would be insane for firing him so early on.

Also, "Yes."I have no idea how they didn't call that. He absolutely had his worst game of the year.Oh, well then. He definitely had a terrible game, but I'm positive that this one single game doesn't reflect his full abilities.Seth Russell and Corey Coleman, because that's the answer you want to hear. (don't lie!)It was 30-7 with a minute to go against GT, took foot off the gas on defense and played soft, just saying.The "I have no idea who to cheer for" Bowl.That was seriously probably the most impressive trash talk thread post I've seen in a long while. The one-liners can be funny as hell, but that one was just...beautiful.I think you'll score more than 30 on them.Can we stop these threads? We're literally just hitting week 6. This needs to be reserved for the offseason.Good. Can't wait until I figure out a way to autoplay the video and then disable the "Close" button.It really was. I've even seen people on UHND and stuff say that "Watson isn't that great of a passer", which is laughable. The rain screwed their passing game in much the same way it did ND's. He still had a 50% completion rate, bear in mind, in that weather. If they'd have thrown more, I think he more than would have made up for it, even if they hadn't scored again, as they were mostly using short passes..which is kind of their thing now.So I guess I can reiterate that Prosise was beating him out as of last week, like I did in the other post, and someone should mention that most of Chubb's production against Bama came after the game was already over.

It might sound insane (understandably because Chubb is great, and obviously biased) to the uninitiated, but I'll take Prosise over him any day at this point, even *with* the rough Clemson game (in which Prosise may have had only 50 yards rushing, but he also had 100 yards receiving).https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3nnh48/of_the_top_ten_rbs_in_terms_of_ypc_only_one_has/

[Next question.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvVzNdOiVOM/maxresdefault.jpg)Great, so now the Vols can lose on a bigger stage.Finally someone with a brain made a decision, **if True.**Never forget to take out the trash, Goldberg.Was mostly joking.

I said a similar thing in the thread yesterday about this. While I don't think he should be necessarily the outright starter, he should be getting more reps because his ceiling is higher, and he just fits the offenses Urban has been running better. I'm really hopeful we don't have a similar issue with Zaire when he returns next year, but I don't think his personality would really allow him to be timid on the field.I've been adding /s tags every so often now...because sometimes people can't pick up on posts that are literally *dripping* with sarcasm, apparently.&gt;Gary Patterson

lol.

It's like putting Bill Snyder on your list. He's not leaving. 

edit: Also, TCU has better resources/money as a school and a better recruiting state, no offense to Georgia who is one of the better states overall. TCU has also made some *serious* upgrades to their facilities recently as well.*removes a single DraftKings commercial per hour*I can't wait for everyone to realize how annoying literally every other TV ad is. All I think of when I watch commercials is "I'm never buying this shit" and /r/wheredidthesodago. Every program has to have like a down year. Hell even OSU had a 6 win season sandwiched in their last 8 fucking decades or whatever of 10+ win seasons.IIRC, isn't Kirby Smart kind of already on the short list as a potential successor to Nick Saban, anyway?If that 1-loss Conference champ is in the B12, the records would be identical, and then it comes down to who you've beaten.I can't wait to hear about a Finebaum caller actually saying this.Sweet. They have a fair number of former good CFB players. Oregon's Masoli is up there as well as Cincinnnati's Collaros.Shit, I actually forgot about that. IIRC I saw the game where he got injured.Here, have some water.I could build a house with the number of bricks we've seen already. Hoping that's corrected soon.lolCam!Mayo with his nasty hair.Portis steal. Oh snap.Getting great looks, just need to put em down.So.. it looks like Brooks is still shooting terribly.Stop talking about furniture and shit.At least ONE of those two-loss CCs would get in, especially if they factor in the schedules and which games were won/lost for the 2-loss teams when compared with Baylor's OOC slate. Sure, it's been talked to death....but it's a very real factor, whether or not their fans want to hear it. Even without that, the way to look at it is that, with two losses and a CC, these other conference champs still have 11 wins. People keep thinking of it in the terms of losses, when in actuality it's been said time and again last year by the committee that they value wins over losses. So, you're still comparing 11-win teams, if all those B12 teams go with one loss. Also, I'm doubting right now that TCU gets past @KSU and @OU, but they always manage to surprise, so we'll see.ND gets pissed and wins out, getting into the CFP.

Oh, this is a prediction, not just my deepest darkest desires?Let's ask Skip Bayless.&gt; in the post season.

Ahh, so the Capitol One Bowl?&gt; Louisiana State

The one spelled out name that always makes me do a double-take.Bold not impossible. jk &lt;3Wat.So, if you want Brooks to make a shot...put someone directly in his way...got it.Just as long as this involves them losing this weekend, I'm okay with it.Still would have 11 wins (if 2-loss and a CCG win), so it's not far-fetched at all.Usain Bolt is so fast I can't even see him in the picture.We really need to thin out the herd on this subreddit.It did. Even after the mods' note about quality of posts prior to the season starting, the offseason lack-of-quality has continued throughout the year.Which are used in conjunction.This time let's both play with our backup QBs. :pI'm not sure how often you've been around during the offseason...but the trolls are definitely out in force during that period as well.I've already seen the things on the front page of the sub! :(The fuck kind of combo is that?He was actually talking about basketball the whole time, asking if Kansas would beat Coach Cal's 38 game streak this year."42-14" /fanofteamthatsnotbamaGood, forgot I even mentioned it.As a somewhat avid scotch drinker...

WHAT THE FUCK, MAN.Yep, although still not that bad. Let's pray it doesn't turn into /r/nba. If your team or one of your team's players is the flavor of the month to hate, you're pretty much screwed on a whole different level.I..totally forgot about the Couric interview, lol.I mean, I'm a Bulls fan...and we have Dunleavy, soo.....I'm sure glad ND never had any ridiculous hype videos.You're sending out rescue missions THIS week but not last week in the fucking monsoon? What the fuck, man! Had to play with wet cats and everything, it's bullshit.It's not that hard to make Thomas uncomfortable this year, apparently.&gt; Personally I think college football is more fun when USC is the powerhouse villain it was in the mid 2000s

I disagree.What is lagswitching? I got accused of it because I laughed about the fact that I managed to score 2 goals while lagging, and one of the guys I was playing against said he was going to report me for it.The ultimate in blue balls. The ball should actually turn blue when that happens.Your defense, given that you're one of few teams in the B12 that actually plays typically very strongly on that side of the ball, is better than anything they will have seen so far. I wouldn't be shocked at all if you beat them. That's the main thing I'm basing this off of.You guys were never the ones truly hyping your team, outside of perhaps the whole "CPJ wants to embarrass BVG" leading up to the game....which also would apply to a few GaSo fans who came out of the woodwork. It was more just the neutral fans who were on the wagon.Not really. Even as the #2 receiver, Brown was largely a non-factor specifically in all the drives that put points on the board aside from one catch in a drive that ended with Kizer running it in, so it really wouldn't have made too much of a difference in our score, if at all. Our 3rd and 4th WRs (Carlisle and Hunter) ended up making the important catches, for the most part, or Prosise, like on the big TD play down the sideline, who is a RB...which wouldn't even be a CB's assignment.True. I guess we'll see. Anything can happen. I think your offense will also be able to play somewhat well, considering their defensive losses.Wouldn't know anything about that. :(Be a fan of whatever team you want.Thinks he's Louis Nix.When it comes to basketball, everyone kinda hates Duke at least a little bit, it seems.I get angry before the game, ND gets angrier because of last week and beats the pants off of Navy after a first quarter close game.http://i.imgur.com/NQHKSVE.gifMizzou somehow miraculously beating Florida would certainly fit the narrative of this year so far.&gt;BOLD PREDICTION: Navy and Notre Dame will see the winner end up winning the game on a last minute drive. I\u2019m 1-2 with these thus far, so idk even know why you should trust me here.

Please, not that close.I'm waiting for the "Keep Everett Golson" shirts to go on sale at Miami after the game.Well, it's recency bias in my head, but I'm looking at it from the standpoint of who the last team played was and how your performance was against them. UF beat Ole Miss, quite a good team, soundly. You guys kinda struggled with South Carolina...who...isn't that great of a team, from what we know so far.&gt;Maybe you ND would've won, **maybe we would've actually blown you out instead of it being a nailbiter**

I figured you'd take a shot like that. The reason you slowed down later was because of the fact that our defense finally settled in, if you actually watch the difference between the way they played early and the way they played later in the game. Then again, I know this because I've watched and rewatched it over the course of the week. Plus, half of your points, I believe, came off of silly lack of ball protection on ND's part.

Not saying they didn't play well, but you capitalized on some inexcusable mistakes that ND made. If it were like a 2 turnover game, with one being the exceptional helmet-to-ball that your kicker pulled off, I'd say it was more of a "sound" win for Clemson, but with 4 turnovers....that's just sloppy all-around play. Weather games like that tend to come down to luck, period, and even with all that ND managed to play you within 2 points. Now go back into sunny weather, like you say, and all those missed catches, the bomb to Robinson for a TD and the big pass Fuller couldn't hold onto over the middle, suddenly happen. Brown probably doesn't fumble either inside the 5.

The weather helped Clemson more than anything, but they capitalized and played a hell of a game...especially the pressure they put on early.
Baseball on the other hand...rally cap time!Fair enough. I'm still hurting because of how much I put into that game.Good to know, NW fan. Seriously, though, I've been using NW basically all my life, sorry, to refer to Northwestern.Well, he never used the words "open" or "memo" so....maybe not.To make it better, Michigan comes in at #5 in the CFP rankings.Indeed, I have tremendous respect for the man and their program. Kentucky on the other hand is....a little easier to dislike.Yeah, it's really all about that for everything but especially as a fan. People will remember those IRL experiences, and apply that to the rest of a fanbase. It's why ND fans have somewhat of a bad reputation among people who have only had a few experiences with random fans. There are some exceptionally uninformed and asshole-ish ND "fans" out there in the world, usually who just latched onto them because it was popular/they were doing well (although the Davie through Weis years thinned a few our).

This is why I always say that visiting South Bend for a game gives you a better feel for the actual fanbase. You'll almost never, if ever, encounter that type of fan...because they'll probably never step foot on campus anyway.

Obligatory: don't take the shit I say here seriously all the time, I'm actually not a dick. Internet conversation is a special beast.&gt; Tennessee tries an onside kick to seal the game but is recovered by UGA with a touchdown run to make the score. Tennessee 17 UGA 14.

Why do I get the terrible feeling Butch would try to pull this and it would come back to bite them in the ass.

&gt;Pig Howard

...is no longer there....so at least the Vols won't get a fucking touchback due to a fumble into the endzone.I'm just worried about how they respond. Yeah, Schmidt said they were frustrated and will work harder...that doesn't necessarily mean smarter, or that they'll be ready for their next game.&gt; Is the season over yet?

I'd prefer to not end the season on a fuckin' loss in a hurricane.Just in general? I mean, look at ND's meltdown last year after FSU with all the injuries. And then it continued into this fucking season.

See also: 2007 NDWho the fuck told you that you could use my link?Second only to ND's Victory March, Rocky Top is the best.

Read AL.com's comments from Bama fans and tell me that Vols fans are the ones with mental health issues.

Got'em.No defense.

Next question.Playing against teams with no defense (read: shitty defenses). When defenses are bad, they give up points. Combine this with the rate of play of some of their offenses.Pretty much. As of late, the way I see it, there are only about 2-3 teams in the B12 that typically tend to have a strong enough defense year-in and year-out that is capable of truly deciding the outcome of a game. Those would be some mix of KSU, OU, Texas and TCU (Patterson has always managed to have a strong defense...although this year's injuries have hit them hard). Longhorns are obviously struggling mightily this year.

The rest (Baylor, WVU in some year, TTU...) basically try their best to outscore their opponents, which they usually do very well at. KU and ISU right now are...kind of off the spectrum.It does have to do with number of plays, absolutely. But a good defense is capable of slowing or halting these drives. When a team like Baylor last year met Texas' defense, they scored under 30, when they met WVU's defense, 20s again (WVU mostly good last year on defense, IMO), when they met KSU's defense, they were held to 38. So the scoring drops when you meet the few defenses in the B12 that are capable of stopping drives and dictating the pace.[Tigger](#i/tigger) **"Yes, yes we did."**Actually, *to an extent*, yes. Their secondary is a massive liability (as most fans and people who know anything about their team will tell you), which leads to points. Just because it's Alabama doesn't mean they are impenetrable, which seems to be the entire basis of your response.Except I gave 3 examples, not just one.Fuck.It certainly has. It'll be interesting to see how things progress defensively over the next few seasons. The good news is that, with MSU's recent success, instead of building up 2-3* guys, MSU can now start at a higher base talent level, recruiting-wise. So it's possible that his departure will at least be somewhat neutralized by that factor.

Wishful thinking, because recruit rankings don't always matter, but it COULD help/have an effect.&gt;But other teams play at least 2 crappy OOC games, and those teams aren't putting up huge numbers.

Actually, ND just put up 62 on UMass...and this includes almost a full half with the 2nd stringers. Hell, they were on pace for 50 against Texas (same as TCU) if they hadn't pulled the offense for almost the entire 4th quarter.

&gt;Michigan and Northwestern have the two best scoring defenses in the nation right now, but if TCU and Baylor played their starters for the entire game and played up tempo for the entire game, they'd easily put up 45+ against Michigan or Northwestern.

What the hell evidence do you have to support this claim? And why are people actually upvoting this nonsense?&gt;9 Notre Dame 22 Clemson 24 (88.34)(in a loss)

Hah. :(It's the only way they can relive their glory days of high school.&gt;Incredibly accurate quarterbacks are a major part of it. Being a Texas Tech fan for the last 11 years, it is almost hard to watch other teams QB play. Boykin and Russell for Baylor and TCU hit open receivers 9 out of 10 times. This can't be said for about 95% of the teams in the country.

I hope nobody actually believes this to be True, because it's flat out hyperbole. If so, they must literally watch no football outside of their own team.

Russell and Boykin have a 63.1% and 63.3% completion rate as of this week in the season, respectively.

Goff @ Cal - 70%

Doughty @ WKU - 74.1%

Lynch @ Memphis - 70.5%

Falk @ WSU - 72.6%

Cody Kessler @ USC - 73%

Stockstill @ MTSU - 67.7%

Hogan @ Stanford - 67.5% (although Hogan has some significantly lower passing attempts)

All or most of these QBs listed are just as, if not more, entertaining to watch when it comes to their passing game, IMO.I've seen enough already. Sadly, I'm probably watching again later this week, though, to re-check some things.I'd like to see them play FSU's or  Clemson's secondary, specifically. We already saw them play MSU's last year and they passed very well, but there was no rushing game to speak of, which was surprising considering Linwood's talent.\u0ca0_\u0ca0This is FSU/Miami week, what do you think you're doing, Gators?!Careful, you're an "8" away from waking up the UGA fans.NFL is a passing league. Reynolds is absolutely amazing for the system Navy runs, but it wouldn't translate well at the next level.

He's fun as hell to watch...against other teams.

He has the size to the point where he could potentially play another position with all his talent, I guess, but it might be hard to find the right fit. Slot WR for his frame might be possible.

&gt;\u201cWhat that means is he may not get to step out between those white lines after his senior year so what he\u2019s trying to do is make the best of it. Every game is one less game of playing football.

As the team that has to play him this week, this is fucking terrifying motivation.

&gt;Reynolds might get the touchdown record and then disappear from football forever.

While things do move on, players like him are remembered not just because they were great, but also because they were standouts on a team that rarely has his level of talent. So I would say I'm hopeful that for many years people will remember what he accomplished, I know I will.I thought I was sad earlier this week.I don't think I could be more jealous of anyone, ever.Indeed. I never meant to imply that was some amazing feat, it's just better than many of the other higher scores we see from this same Baylor offense.

...that's about the best way I could word this response. :/Probably lack of a quality win for ND. Clemson now has *one* with ND, but ND has none with Texas, GT, UMass, UVA.

MSU's "quality" win against Oregon may have also been negated by Utah's performance, I guess? Also, the close game against Purdue doesn't help, but that's just Purdue. 

I'm not sure what this thing takes into account, though.

Maybe I'm missing something here that explains what is weighed more heavily, though.Only one way to solve this...

8 team B1G Championship Game.

We'll call it "The Ocho Trophy".But of course. I left that door open for someone. :pIt's literally all interpretation at the time. To an extent, some are just very clear.I've always felt like the rule/penalty is more of a deterrent than anything that was truly put into place to clarify exactly what is and is not targeting. Unfortunately, the fundamental problem of shitty tackling technique still exists, coupled with guys who look for that highlight reel hit.It makes getting hammered during sadness after a game that much easier.The point I was replying to specifically was speaking to the accuracy, not the length, of their passes. Also, yards per completion also has to do with the work the receivers do after the fact, which is why individual stats don't tell you the full story. Not disagreeing with your numbers, just pointing that they're irrelevant to my point, and explaining how yards per completion works.&gt;Like I have family that are ND grads and they're completely great about how they support the team.

Yeah, they tend to train family well on how to act. Parent and all the family friends is how I got my fandom from birth. Been doing this all my life...sometimes unfortunately. Even during the worst seasons, like 2007 and during Willingham/Davie, I enjoyed the hell out of watching this team play.

&gt;But it's those Catholic prep school kids

Attended one for a short time. Did not enjoy.

&gt; that grew up watching Rudy

Shit...I like the movie. :( (not the actual dude, he's a dick)

&gt;never went to ND

Fuck...

&gt;couldn't even tell you the name of the town or state ND is fucking in

It's in Boston...Texas. Right?

My biggest gripe (aside from being an obnoxious asshole IRL) is when someone pulls for the team but doesn't bother to know the names of any of the primary players. I mean, come on, it's the starting quarterback and you don't even know who he is?

Been watching ND Basketball since before LaPhonso Ellis.And even then, it's definitely gotten more....special...this year.[How about the tango?](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/485261/erin_andrews3.JPG)I like most of the all-black uniforms that ASU wears.

I mean, sometimes it happens that way where they do better at a new place. For example, Tenuta was pretty much a joke at ND, but he's done pretty well with UVA's defensive unit overall since his arrival.He's the butt of almost every joke including even outside of Knoxville, although I'd say Bert is taking the cake right now for what he's doing to Arkansas. I genuinely feel for the Arky fanbase.I'm not usually even that helpful, given that I typically forget the Wiki even exists.

I'm giving myself the youtried.jpg award.Nice.

After the MissSt game to start the year, admittedly, I kind of lost track of SoMiss with everyone else I've been watching. Quietly going 3-2 right now, with the other loss outside of MissSt being a rather close game against Nebraska.

Don't let the score fool you, the MissSt/SoMiss game was a closer game than it looks, even with a good number of 4th down attempts, they looked good at times.

Certainly hope things continue to trend upward for that program. Not a bad shot to get bowl eligible this year, which would be HUGE for Monken. Might have to start an NCAA14 dynasty...http://i.imgur.com/fbiga.pnginb4 I wonder who their coach will be.http://i.imgur.com/uvJFGX8.pngI...I meant Miami.[The Unauthorized Biography of Nick Saban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRyTzZ60O8U) always gets me.My brain doesn't work for like 23 hours of the day.

Well, good luck with that, then.It's the only way to communicate with all the racket in Clemson's fuckin' stadium.Damn with the foreshadowing post.http://i.imgur.com/7yxWyYQ.jpgSounds like you'll fit in great at LSU.CFB crowds are the greatest....where do fans like you come from?Which makes them still probably centrist at this point. /kindasarcasmYes.I guess it's just that we don't see such ridiculous statements coming from fans of the successful teams in that conference, at least around here right now.All of this is True.Fuck'em. If you want people to NOT be crazy as shit drunk..then let them pace themselves. Plus, the prices are already going to be high enough that students aren't going to be getting blasted on whatever they sell in the stadium.I like how you're leaving out the benefit that your own team would get.Can confirm, have asked this before. Bad idea.2-losses means 11 wins for conference champs. The committee values wins over losses, which has been said a bunch of times at least since late last year. They're not "2-loss teams" so much as "11-win teams"...the same number of wins that anyone with a single loss would have coming out of the B12. As long as those wins have quality to them, I think they have a decent shot at least, depending on what other conference champs pull off as well. Also timing matters, obviously.
I just decided to leave that out as it might give connotations of bias to some.This is great.Well both of those posts are getting hit with downvotes from people without the balls to respond or provide any reasoning to the contrary, so I have no idea what to think.Could be, but this was the only thread that got hit like that.&gt; who won their 11th game in the conference championship game, and thus was 10-2 in the regular season. 

A CCG is an added quality opponent, so I fail to see how that negates that win...unless the other division was truly shitty that year and they were playing something like a 6-6 team in the CCG.

&gt;The Big 12 doesn't have the opportunity to play a 13th game, which isn't the fault of the teams involved and should be directed at the conference.

That's True, but to counter that....you schedule at least remotely decent teams for the OOC slate and avoid FCS squads. People bitch about the SEC scheduling an FCS cupcake, but at the end of the day at least they make up for it...if they make it to the SECCG...by playing another quality opponent.Skip Bayless, everybody.My trash talk game is terribleYou sure it wasn't all the private jets in South Bend? That was fun to talk about.To be fair, they stuck around for the entire beating in South Bend. Though they had to wait for their jets to warm up.I'M PRETTY SURE NOTRE DAME ALREADY SUBMITTED THEIR VOTE TO REMOVE THEM IN WEEK 1THE TEXAS VERSION OF BOB SAGET.When I think "understands young people" I think "Republican Presidential Candidate".

edit: wait...this isn't the trash talk threadOh I know. I still manage to point it out sometimes because it's frustrating sometimes when it's just a genuine conversation.I DON'T KNOW. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE TEXAS FOOTBALL OF INTERNET COMMUNITIES.I'm waiting for those sources from Miami and Texas.Please, nothing shocks me after another FBS program managed to hire Charlie Weis as a head coach.Definitely not fucking Notre Dame, apparently.*sends out a search party*TIL William Perry is a football coach.You're right, Northern Florida is really just Southern Alabama.&gt; I WOULD TRASH TALK TEXAS, BUT I THINK ALL THEIR FANS ARE ALREADY DEAD ~~INSIDE~~Little risky.*waits for his shout-out*

---

I love that we're describing the Fulmer Cup as "Criminal Acheivement", lol.I was kidding about Texas. I'm fully on board with Strong needing the key third year at least to show improvement, especially given his track record at UL.&gt;Their schedules are inherently easier anyway because the lack of a CCG grants them an extra bye week during the regular season to rest up. 

I wouldn't go this far, since the FCS squads being scheduled by most FBS teams aren't exactly NDSU or EWU, etc. It's a scrimmage/practice for most of these teams scheduling FCS squads. It's a game, yes, but it's not exactly one where that FCS squad even has a remote shot even against most of the FBS teams' second string, let alone the first string. With 12 games only, and I realize I might be biased, you'd be hard-pressed to convince me that Notre Dame's schedule is easier than most teams that have a CCG who also schedule FCS simply because of the number of games.

I do, however, agree with the fact that the B12 *could* add a CCG, yet they chose not to. Just like with Baylor's schedule which Briles was pretty openly supportive of in the past, it's their bed, now they have to lay in it. That's the thing, when you have no CCG but you have 2+ outright bad teams on your schedule which takes the cake.*Ding.*If he's actually having to contend with former staff members trying to undermine him, that's some fucked up shit.Just FYI, next time I think the article title with the sub-title (the question under the image) may have been better.I figured as much, and I wasn't trying to say that's necessarily what you mean, but still felt compelled to bring it up, as some people tend to...argue....that ND sometimes schedules easy.

I agree, the number of conference games should have zero bearing on the situation. Number of conference games might take part in determining a conference champ, but it has zero bearing on CFP selection which is ultimately to figure out a *national* champion. So what, you have 9 conference games. That doesn't mean you can't schedule better opponents for those three OOC slots.Stanley is the article file photo...right after his worst game of the year.

edit:

&gt;after having his leg rolled up on the week prior 

Glad someone else is pointing this out. It happened at around the half of the UMass game, so I wouldn't be necessarily shocked if he was still feeling it last Saturday. They really didn't play him for much more against UMass (IIRC) after it happened, so there wasn't a way to see how much of a difference it made against live action until Lawson lined up across from him...who is hard enough to block as it is.Devil's advocate: we don't know how many messages it was, so no way to tell just how much time this would have taken. Could have just been a text or two, which doesn't require much focus.

*Not excusing it in the slightest, if True.*Click link, left to right, top to bottom.I mean...the Urban just won a national championship, the other just started, at a blue blood program no less, and has already demonstrated massive success in building a powerhouse out of an academic school (Stanford) that was mostly terrible before his arrival.Fiesta!

...or Russell Athletic. :'(

Fuck injuries.At this point, with the way the Vols have been playing under Butch, I'm not sure what I want to be True.I'm so confused. Am I looking at a ranking system that currently has WVU as #1 after Week 5 or am I reading this entirely wrong?What kills me about this team is that all the skill talent is there. I continue to feel like the OL is the one thing truly holding this team back from being amazing. That and some play-calling issues at times.Was announced/posted yesterday, FYI.As an example, look no further than Clausen at ND: ridiculous talent, but the OL basically refused to block for him because they didn't want to block for the new guy. What happens? He gets clobbered (literally sacked a team-record 34 times in one year). Even with all of that, he did a pretty awesome job passing. I can't even imagine what numbers he'd put up with, say, this ND OL.**EDIT: Well, this is awkward, now that the comment above has been explained to me....**

---
~~*Commence with the "lol the butthurt is real" comments, but your response was a pretty thinly-veiled attempt to drive the point home even more about our game, especially given the lack of context in this thread. So, now you get this response...*~~

edit after the cross-out: lol my butthurt is real

---

~~It seems some of you just can't stop. First I have someone dredging up 2 month old comments telling me they "told me they'd win (paraphrasing)" (disregarding that my comment they were responding to would have been made well before we lost anyone to injury....like a starting QB...something Clemson should be able to relate to...and our best blocking tight end the week before which was clearly missed for our game), now this completely out of context response for this thread. I get it, some of you *really* think Clemson can beat ND 42-10 any day of the week. Great for those people, I guess.~~

~~&gt;The rain took about a 15%-20% toll on max-output potential.~~ 

~~What is your point? Literally the same can be said for both teams (except I'm not willing to pull some random percentage from thin air), only one team was pretty unlucky with the ball security and the weather. One thing that's clear from the other side is that ND left 14 potential points off the board with both a dropped pass to Robinson in the endzone and Chris Brown's lack of ball security. Like it or not, luck does play a factor in ball security in such weather. If you have 4+ turnovers, bad or good weather, at some point it's less the other team and more the fact that your mistakes are giving the game away. (see: Bama against Ole Miss this year, or part of ND's performance against ASU in 2014. Same could be said with the UNC/ND game last year which included a pick six against a relatively rough defense as well).~~

~~Clemson didn't have as many ball-security mistakes, as was evident by the overall turnover battle, meaning they definitely prepared better (as they should have with double the time) and played a much more sound game, which is commendable. Did you limit the playbook later on in the game...which may have slowed you down a bit? Absolutely. But guess what....don't look now, but ND limited themselves right out of the gates by trying to force the straight-up run of Prosise, which your defense was ready for right away, without mixing it up at all. So again, with the lack of adjustment early-on, that's a self-inflicted mistake on ND's part, too.~~

~~Another area to give credit to Clemson would be specifically *two* of the four turnovers which were heads on the ball, especially the kicker-caused fumble on the opening 2nd half kickoff which led to Watson's TD run, which were just excellent plays being made. But something like Brown's fumble at the goal line was all on him trying to do too much in the terrible conditions when he should have tucked it and gone down, I'm not handing out credit for something to the other team when it's undeserved. I, and most others, have said myself that Clemson came out fast and caught ND off guard early and I've given credit where it's due. Plus, you capitalized pretty damned well overall on ND's mistakes.~~

~~That said, that was not ND's best, even with the the current already-injured roster. It's also quite possible that it wasn't Clemson's best. But, we haven't necessarily seen them look truly convincing against a single P5 team where at least we have the GT (regardless of what you think about GT's team they're not completely hideous, it was a 23 point lead with less than a minute to go) and Texas (although TCU certainly dwarfed that final score) performances for ND. There's no game you can point to right now against a remotely decent opponent outside of ND that proves that Clemson "left something off the board". I'm saying this not because I'm annoyed about the loss (which will obviously be your and some of your fellow fans' first reactions), but because I've watched your team extensively so far. What's more, you had double the prep time for a team that was already banged up. So, the excuse for the close game with UL was the short rest period (even though they had a similar rest period, too), and now in this close win we have to hear "we left (madeup)% of 'max-output potential' on the field" line...completely disregarding the fact that the other team may have left production on the field, too. When does it end? As someone familiar with being a fan of a sports team, I think I can guess the answer: Never.~~

~~Is the ceiling high enough that Clemson COULD be a lot better than they have displayed so far this year, potentially even making the CFP? Sure, absolutely...*and I'm all for it*. But at this point in time, nothing that Clemson has done on the field in all 4 of their games this year has been the display of a team that has some massive advantage over ND's current team, which is the point you were trying to make.~~

edit: This is how I get my frustration out, so just roll with it.Well what the fuck. Great day I'm having.This makes more sense now that I use my head.Main objection: it's literally been one fucking year.

That should be the ONLY objection, along with "someone will ALWAYS bitch and moan about being left out" and "they are students", too.Seriously. The idea of a BYE is just terrible, IMO.Time to start a spinoff of the Fulmer Cup? Almost like they did Saved By The Bell: The College Years, could do Fulmer Cup: The Adult Years.

Shut up, it's ~~a great~~ an idea.USC, what the fuck?What the fuck, Trojans?

Fucking every one of the teams we are playing this year are laying eggs. Watch, fucking Clemson will even end of up going like 6-6 now this year, god fucking dammit. Can we get a single opponent this year that doesn't look like garbage this year?&gt;as is tradition

This just in, Sark to replace Kevin Sumlin at A&amp;M.*raises hand*

He was partly responsible for their great run under Carroll, being on his staff, and they're building up their facilities to be insane. I expected better from USC this year.

And to be fair, the only thing people have for his record as a head coach was a couple years at Washington as their sample size. Plus, he was following Tyrone Willingham, not exactly easy.Should have just let ND take Ronald Jones II.Why do you insist on saddening the Vols fan in me?I'll say again, if GT beats Clemson I'll be slightly fucking confused.No conference has many clearly dominant teams so far right now, do they?Stop deflecting!I wouldn't mind USC being considered at least a remotely quality win or loss in two weeks, but they may have gone and fucked that up completely now. :(Please sleep and take Sark with you.&gt;we sark we sark we sark!Wow, I thought it was longer than that. Justin Yoon, ND's freshman, had the leg for a 46 yarder @Clemson in a mnnsoon.^^Please ^^no.This cracked me up. I'm not happy about your loss, either, though.I feel like this whole "Chip Kelly back to CFB" movement is absurd. He was 10-6 for two years in a row in Philly and they've only played ~~3~~ 4 games this year, I believe. They're not letting him go.I'm just sitting here hoping we don't fuck up against Navy after the big loss to Clemson. :(Ah thanks. Still very early in the year.I'm just sitting here waiting for Clemson to piss me off further by losing to Georgia Tech.&gt; I can't believe Southern Cal fired Kiffy

I get that he's on Bama's staff right now, but I can't believe someone can't believe Kiffin was fired from a head coaching gig. He's not a remotely good head coach.That was a clusterfuck of a relationship between the office and Harbaugh. Actually, the SF fiasco could maybe be looked at as similar to the Nebraska change, wanting a "nicer" head coach that's "easier to manage". Seems to be a questionable move for both teams.It's possible, as another USC fan I believe has said, that Sark was just an "interim guy" that they brought in which they knew already had ties to the program, with his being part of Carroll's staff, to "maintain things" for a while as they find their ideal candidate.Sorry, it was a parallel that just occurred to me.I'm sorry.I guess tonight is #SarkNight2015

So, can USC be a double digit favorite next week? Kthx.We should probably hold onto both, just in case, depending on what happens with Clemson/GT on Saturday.You'll get no argument from me, and it frustrates the hell out of me to see it as well. I felt the same with what Michigan was going through for a short while and I don't even like them. 

That said, sometimes the stars just align and you get fucked. For example, ND got screwed with Davie not really working out after they pushed Lou out, and then with the O'Leary fiasco, so they had to settle on what was available...Willingham...and then they did that absurd contract for Weis all because he lost a close game to USC. I repeat, he got a ridiculous contract extension at least in part because of a loss. Most of this was because of shitty decision making, though. A lot of these coaching changes and administrative decisions just hit home for me, given ND's recent issues.

This applies to many businesses/places, not just universities, but sometimes the people in charge are just out of touch with what makes sense for their respective programs.&gt;Not enough room for three TEs.

We'll take another one. We could use 'em.Uhoh...I might cook again this weekend. Dammit.&gt;You can fill a locker room with all the talent in the world and still underperform.

30 for 30: The Story of Notre Dame FootballThis.....this needs to become a thing.I'll get over it when we erase the sadness with our next win.Calm down. Still the week after. I'm sure I'll be fine after our next win. Either way, outside of our game, you're a top 10 team now with CFP hopes, so yes, I might end up talking about you.I would say GT was the one team that ND has beaten so far that really had too many expectations for this year. UMass started out pretty rough against Colorado, Temple, and ND in a row, but now that they're getting into the conference slate, they should start doing a little better after the win over FIU, but they're a new program to the FBS that has shown some improvement each year. Texas is still currently in a state of rebuild/disarray. And UVA has played well in August lately but overall really can't be expected to produce wins with their schedule the way it is compared to the program state, the deck being pretty heavily stacked against them in August with UCLA, ND and BoiseSt.&gt;Bonus fact! Did you know Joakim Noah has one of the most punchable faces in the NBA? 

You take that back!["wonderful city"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY)With Texas' current state, it's like playing Purdue...you have no idea how good they might end up being.Longhorn fans still not dead: "What is spirit?"Good time to mention /r/footballstrategy, too. (of which he is a mod)I also feel like the Longhorns rise will eventually cause a hiccup or two for Baylor as well, not that I'm saying they won't still be good. Their rise is directly kind of correlates to Texas' struggles, if we look at Briles' record compared to Texas.Honest question, what makes people think Graham is a target for Texas? (I'm completely unaware of a relationship between the two outside of him coaching at Allen and Rice?)I can't tell if BK is looking to stay for the long haul or not.How was the split between the two? Like is Oregon open to a possibility of him returning?I wouldn't be surprised if Navy at least puts a scare into ND after last weekend. Reynolds is amazing and hard to stop.

GT may have an outside shot at Clemson if they manage to play their best game of the year. Even then, if I were betting, I'd bet that it wasn't too close.

Plus, Vols/UGA game is *always* something interesting.Five off the top of my head:

LeBron

JR Smith

1988...[the greatest individual season in college football history](http://i.imgur.com/vB9B5.gif)

Please god no."That escalated quickly." isn't really what I would use for just spray painting last year's score on a well.

I mean, the last time that was used accurately, Brick killed a guy.No.I mean, people don't really hate all SEC programs equally, especially since Alabama basically delivered half of those championships in the streak on their own. THAT's the program to hate. Yet, we'll continue to hear random fans of other programs, like MissSt (a team that probably had an easier road to the #1 ranking in 2014 than ND in 2012...with their wins over 3 ultimately 8-5 "top 10" teams) fans for instance, every so often talk about how tough the SEC is and basically claim the championship streak, as if they're some big time contributors.

I don't hate the conference, I hate that there are fans of certain programs just basically riding the coattails of the majors with staying power (namely Alabama and LSU, UGA to an extent) that have actually been proven multiple years over.Congratulations, you are a college football fan, just like almost everyone else.[It's fucking scotch.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/amateur_hour_anchorman.gif)Lucky for us people aren't easily offended anymore.Damn. Dick move.Thomas was *supposed* to be a whole different monster, given his arm should have been a threat. I'm worried about Keenan simply because he's the better of the two right now.Nice.

Bartender I know apparently got drunk enough one night that they took a flight to Florida...just up and bought a ticket that night. Woke up by their phone in a hotel and it was their boss asking where they were.Well if there's anything we know about this ND team, it's that they can totally play a full game of football.

:(There's usually a couple that are in the middle, more of the secondary rivalries, and then the late-season ones are the big ones.I like UGA, but....I need the Vols to win. :(UGA is funny because they're so familiar to me, given ND's ability to screw up in a very similar manner.True, but I try to avoid claiming the academics...being that family went there, not me.

Also, UGA has Mike Woods. There's not too many, if any, better fans than that.There's some KU fans that don't like him, from what I remember from some past discussions, obviously in part given the in-state rivalry factor. Mainly, I think some just feel that the credit he's being given *at this point in time* is a little overblown. I tend to agree *to an extent*, given that his second tenure has been pretty lackluster [compared to his first] for a coach held in such high regard. That said, it's not just what he's done as a coach, but he's also had some great "apprentices" that have gone on to do great things (Bob Stoops, etc).

He definitely built the program from pretty much nothing, but at what point do you say "okay it's been over two decades, you shouldn't be less consistent than you were earlier in your career"? Frankly, I think similar to some of the other older coaches who had great success (Beamer, etc), things are faltering a bit and the writing is on the wall and someone *will* have to take over within in the next ~5 years. I respect the circlejerk about "he'll coach until he dies", and that's all well and good, but it's not realistic..and it's almost a little selfish. I hope he sticks around for a couple more seasons, though, because his teams are typically a lot of fun to watch.You have no money in your fuckin' wallet.Just look at how Arkansas started the 2014 season and you'll have your answer, which is "yes."

Though I still think losing half of the tandem rushing attack they had, with Williams being injured, last year is hurting them.At this point I'm thinking most Vols fans *WANT* him gone. And as one, I'm starting to agree.Excuse me but that is fake. Identity theft is not a joke, /u/matthc!I wonder how long a game between Al Golden and Butch Jones would take.What's most annoying to me is that I was always firmly on OU's side of this thing....but with the beatings Texas has been taking (not just on the field, but all the other stuff, too)...I feel a little bad for them.

Teams that have beaten them so badly this year should feel ashamed. Shame on you, TCU.I think that also depends on if he has another major issue a la Golson academics, "the 5" academics, etc, too. Not that it can be directly attributed to the coach, necessarily, but it's a matter of having the right guys and keeping them honest. Also if injuries keep getting worse, someone is going to start asking questions. Sure, Malik's is understandable due to his positioning and the guy rolling up on him, but Tranquill's is at least a little questionable on the celebration...even though ACLs can be fickle. Folston's as well wasn't due to some major hit, either. It'll be interesting to see how the next few years develop. Sounds ridiculous, but he could just get tired of seeing players seemingly drop like flies so might just look for a change in scenery, which I'm sure a bunch of schools would be open to, and be willing to pay pretty damned well. Coaching at ND long-term isn't for everyone, in part given the higher academic expectations for their players.

Also, he already got some interest from the NFL after 2012, so god only knows what will happen if he delivers a couple 10+ win seasons in a row...if he gets to chance to stick around long enough to do so. We know this, Swarbrick will do whatever he can to keep someone happy/around, like he showed with getting Ronnie Stanley to return instead of bolting for almost a sure 1st Round draft pick last year.

So many factors/possibilities.&gt; I will choke myself to death with fried food if OU pisses this game away. 


*tagged*
I never really got into it, but this is one of the few scenes I enjoyed seeing....Careful with that.Yes, that was 100% correct.I thought we knew this already? It's like, so only one team has to travel (instead of going neutral site)...and the plane was already booked anyway or something, IIRC.Wholeheartedly agree. That's why I said "**starting to** agree", as I don't think it's as bad as most think. The blowing the UF game was pretty much inexcusable, IMO, when you have that kind of lead, though.

Also, didn't the team lose two offensive lineman, already one of the WORST units on the team, prior to this season even starting? I could be wrong and maybe it was only one. Butch needs to get on the OL recruiting something heavy, because that's one of the biggest differences made since BK's arrival at ND and it's starting to show on the field in a big way this year. Without that unit, you can't place much blame on Dobbs and Hurd, even with all their talent, which is frustrating to see go to waste.

Obviously, perspective is important. I think that you're right and it's not as bad as most think. As for me, I think part of it is just giving away the UF win...it's been a fucking decade. If they were getting blown out of the water a la UGA vs Bama, I'd be "outraged". Even last year when I was down in Knoxville, they caught on eventually and made the Bama game competitive, which I was impressed with. I'm just hoping for at least a similar margin this year in T-Town, but we'll see.

For the most part, I truly do want Butch to work out for the Vols...and obviously a lot of this is reactionary due to this story piling on top of the couple losses.I'm already old enough to see it, lol.Joe Schmidt.I mean, he was at least rated as a 2* (which is obviously also ridiculous to think about now) by Rivals and a starter at CMU, not exactly a True "walk-on". He walked on at Wiscy because he wanted to move closer to home and felt CMU weren't helping his game with the positions they were trying to fit him into. Semantics, I guess. Also, his game really peaked after college, so he wasn't exactly the posterchild DE back then that he is now.Obviously, I understand why you'd want to argue that point to give JJ credit where it is due (understandably). However, it's a little disingenuous, because most walk-ons are perhaps guys that weren't good enough to start *anywhere* else or be recruited by many/any FBS schools and worked their way onto the field from nothing. He got a scholarship right out of high school and started somewhere else before he chose to transfer home to Wisconsin.Fair enough.This may sound ridiculous. If you have all the talent you need for any system and you are a coach that understands that system and makes the right play-calls in the right situations, literally any of your choices could be the best. Any system with the right components can work magic. Part of what makes CFB so great is seeing the diversity of all the different teams and their offensive schemes, which all can produce amazing results when you have the right components in place. It's usually when coaches come in and try to install a new system without consideration for what they're fielding that causes problems.

If there were one single system that worked better than all the rest, everyone would be using it and only recruiting players for that style.

---

edit: To put it another way, based on system alone and all parts being equal, none of them can truly give you a...*cough*...decided schematic advantage.That's why I put "many". IIRC he was also unrated, too, from most recruiting services, if not all. He only got offers from AF and Cincinnati alone, I believe, and that's it.This is great. I really hope he doesn't pass from this condition.Let's find out.

Bears to Bears, please.

*Begins reading article...*Go to hell, you bastard. I need this.I know you're joking around, but Rudy played a single play. Joe Schmidt went from walk-on to starter and team captain. It's not even close.Right, so all of them have their own merits across the board. One is not "better than the other offensive systems" on its own, and these approaches listed are applied in specific situations.

What I meant by that line was there is not some "single system" that simply "works better" than the others just by itself. If that were True, everyone would be running an identical offense across the country.If all parts are equal, then it doesn't matter. Literally every game comes down to match-ups and how you take advantage of mismatches. That's how teams win games. Their OL plays better than the other DL, their WRs play better then the other team's secondary, etc. If everything is a wash, personnel-wise, then neither system is going to bring better results. This is why you watch film to prepare for other teams, so you can see what you can use to your advantage and learn that team's defensive tendencies.Easy, I love the shit of this game. I probably pull for about up to 8-10 teams overall, though. But in the ones I'm totally neutral, I just love the game and watching the action/crowd, etc. unfold.

Also, it may be for an upcoming opponent, so I'll watch a LOT of that team, typically. Although lately I realized I got a little obsessive with....certain teams...so I needed to slow down on the re-watches.That's a weird question. Every system works to its full potential when they have the best players and if they can create mismatches against a defense. Overall, if you have players that aren't that great, then they typically aren't going to execute that system as well as a team who runs the same system with better players and preparation/familiarity with the system. That said, any team can be shut down if the defense is talented and prepared for what the offense throws at them. Every week is different and every player is human, so units have good and bad games all the time.

It's just not as simplistic as you are trying to make it. If it were, coaches and players wouldn't be watching film for their upcoming opponents at all, which shows them what tendencies each individual player/unit has that they can capitalize on.You forgot "triple option".[You are correct.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKbOtWeAEnY)&gt; I actually like Yea Alabama 

[*Checks flair*](http://i.imgur.com/XZJSgPg.gif)[This will answer your question.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHo)

Let me know when you've watched the entire video.I wish Notre Dame played Rocky Top as a secondary victory march.It's True, though. The main problem certain GT fans have is that people will refer to their entire offense as the triple option...when in fact there's a bunch of other things going on, like the Veer, etc. which I don't think necessarily qualifies as the triple, but I can't remember.Look at my name. What do you think?Regis Philbin, Class of 1953&gt; ~~CUSA~~ officiating is just horrible. 

A potted plant.Chip KellyPlease, Dantonio is retiring at MSU.Pllus, Tony Alford is an awesome recruiter and RB coach, so it'll be tough to pull it off, IMO.Best OL for USC.

Trojans...we understand.I'm pretty sure Will Fuller used up all of the gods' "Not todays" against UVA.I knew you cheated, you fucker.Someone wants to die. That's all I know. I *will* find them...Get out.&gt;19 Notre Dame

[Top 25 pass defense? Really?](http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/giphy.gif)Put the bottle down. It's barely Saturday, bro.Given that ND had no major injuries against Clemson, I would celebrate...but I'd probably tear an ACL.[Full scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DRoTHnt5Fg)I wanna say this was posted like on Monday...just FYI. Great story either way and just a testament to how great some of the Clemson folk are.Well damn Texas...This is looking much more like Texas' defense.Missed his own motion man wide open.So I guess this is how you play rivals. Make them think you suck and then come out and punch them in the mouth.OU getting this stop is like in Little Giants where they gain a yard.Texas, stop giving this away. :(I recognize this Texas team.I'd like a LB Corps with Malik Jefferson and Jaylon Smith.C'mon it'll be fun.Jesus, and that was without Ridge.What if I told you Charlie Strong was going to go 1-4 including getting blown out of the water twice, and then they'd beat their undefeated top 10 rival OU.This is great.[OU fans right now](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/804/617/d5b.jpg)So this means we can stop hearing about how amazing Samaje Perine is now, right? He's done literally nothing all year and had something like 40 yards this game.Texas is a quality win now, right?My heart just stopped.3rd down....let's run Dobbs...again. Fuck.Verne?I understand that it's time for a new OC.When ND on NBC has less commercials, you know you have a problem.KICKER OF THE FUCKING GAME!!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHoI'm not even watching CBS anymore and I'm expecting my TV to change back to CBS and show UGA scoring and then going for 2 to win the game. Any minute now...Every Vols season as of late.KSU. What the fuck. You HAD this game basically in hand.Yeah, I thought of that just a second ago, lol.I think they know. :pNot just chaos, we need everyone to have a loss for our own hopes.*Batteries /sThis feels like TCU is basically about to take it. :'''(Looked for a bit like a miss, I just yelled at my TV. My neighbor HAS to hate me in the fall.I still have no words for that game except "lolrivalry".Remember those ridiculous defenses KSU used to have? Gonna need them right about....now.Well, attempting on fourth and not getting it most certainly  would have been a loss.#FUCK!I hate CFB.My top three teams:

ND - ehhh against Navy

MSU - shitting it up against Rutgers

Vols - Surviving the fuck out of UGA
"How can you hate Bill Snyder?"

Easy, watch this game.I'm....disappointed in you, KSU.Well, OSU has stayed at #1.#GO GREEN!

Fuck you, Dabo, for trying to make me like you.I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this, just saw it.You already have me. I'm pretty much around all the time, so when someone uses it wrongly it usually gets addressed. :p

&lt;3I just saw the rant, I love it. It's really not fun because I'm supposed to hate teams we lose to for like the rest of the season. I can dream of a rematch, even though I know it probably won't happen, and with all the injuries it wouldn't necessarily help our case. :(It's a rumor....about removing some follows on Twitter?

What the fuck are we doing here at /r/CFB?

Sorry, I just...whatever.Been using that one, or [Statfox](http://www.statfox.com/cfb/injuries.asp) for a while now.Dat Hawaii Defense!I care as a random fan. I have no idea why, but part of it has had to do with the late games and being able to extend my football watching until 3-4am some days. :p

I just love it and have been following for a while. They play hard and look pretty impressive at times. It's evident that they at least have some talent, like with Iosefa going to Tampa for a short while. Now he's not in the NFL though, like experimental league.Shit, cmon Max.

Woolsey is the guy that started last year, I think, though. So it's not completely a brand new guy.

edit: fuuuck that could be a bad one.Yeah, FYI, Woolsey is a better runner than Wittek.HAHAHAH he just flattened his own blocker.I get what you kinda mean, but I like how you were trying to make some grandiose statement here.Yeah that makes me sad. I'm torn as to what is really hampering things with Hawaii, just Norm or a bunch of other factors.4 yards deep in the endzone. Sure, run it the fuck out.Sometimes I really feel like Woolsey is a more dynamic QB than Wittek and wonder if they didn't just start Max "because" of the USC factor.Drink up, half pint.Holy fucking shitballs.Yay facemask. /sPlease no.NO CATCH


JUGGLEWatch this take half an hour to review it.YES!Please Bears...please....66 yards....what the fuck. That's....has that ever been made before?Absolutely terrible. What a ridiculous rant. Just stop it, Dabo.

^^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^cannot ^^^^^^^^^confirm ^^^^^^^^^or ^^^^^^^^^deny ^^^^^^^^^if ^^^^^^^^^that's ^^^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^^^why ^^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^truly ^^^^^^^^^feel.Barning.I'm scared.I liked it too. But, this is brand new, so you can't compare it to the old cast's version. This is like people crying about how great Jon Stewart was, so Travor obviously sucks. The show is in its infancy.Every opponent on ND's schedule could cause trouble every week, especially teams like PITT, BC, Purdue, etc. They've always been problematic at times when they "weren't expected to be great".

I'm just *really* familiar with my team's ability to give others a chance.Hah. We'll see if that helps.I can't find that line anywhere in the article. Are you paraphrasing something?Any thread about them eventually has the word thrown around. It's kind of absurd. Any loss they might have or have incurred means they obviously "Clemsoned". It didn't use to be this bad here, but this is also what comes with higher sub membership numbers, as the typical quality of conversation you'd find on the other boards finds its way onto /r/CFB.Seems like the worst possible week for this to be going on....ND/USC week.Bottled directly from the source?I mean, I'd be surprised if he were fired already. I'm assuming that's just overreaction and this is just typical twitter "news".You'll have to forgive him. Ohio State fans literally have no clue what it means to struggle for even a couple years.Nope. When it's in South Bend, it's in the middle of the year. When it's out there, it's at the end of the year. This has been going on for ages (at least most of my life, IIRC).

AKA USC is afraid of the cold. :pAll of our opponents we've beaten have been screwing us, so far. The unexpected one would be Texas delivering against OU.....this is a one line tweet with zero details.I dunno, they may be too salty.They were still feeling the effect of scholarship shortages, too. Kind of a big deal. In the next two years, though, whoever is coaching there, Sark or otherwise, will have a wealth of talent.Shit...No, it's obviously because you are afraid of the cold.

Although what you said makes sense.Most leaders in any realm of influence surround themselves with smarter people than themselves. You'd never learn anything if you didn't.Sucks for the schools who can't really stand to battle it out.I'm probably wrong, but I think that's some sort of snap interference.You mean the OL where Tuerk, their Center and best OL, went down in the first quarter?Celebrate "Survival".Good enough to ruin my day when ND plays them.He can't answer too much anyway right now, given how fresh this all is. Is there something I'm missing?Watch him come back to ND Football on NBC.What also sucks is he was a very high draft prospect, too.Same here. No idea what to expect from USC for ND or Michigan for MSU.Damn, that was quick. He was pretty high on ND as well, along with UM.

Also, he's a 4-star in the 247 composite, which is what we use on /r/CFB.I'm not sold on that with UM being up there...and with the way you've been playing recently.Weird, not according to the profile for UM, but who knows. I just think with the way UM has been playing that HAS to help them a bit with him as well. And I'm sure Harbaugh's staff isn't exactly going to just "leave him alone", or at least I'd be surprised.

Then again, since he's opening up the recruiting again, he could decide to just go in a different direction completely, who knows.Is it the Shamrock or the Golden Dome that tells them to run the "fumble the football" play?I refuse to get my hopes up. He'd certainly fill a hole with Jaylon potentially leaving after this year. Then again....if Smith decided to stay for his senior year, oh my god.I vaguely remember something about that, what was the injury issue again?Ouch. Kinda sucks for a guy that needs to hit people to have a shoulder injury/issues like that. Wonder why he got that high of a rating, given that factor.It's almost like many people only look for calls that were missed that might have benefited their team.Both of my flairs be like: \u0ca0_\u0ca0[CFB Injury Report](http://www.donbest.com/ncaaf/injuries/)I'm worried the ND/BC game will resemble the 2012 game where it's like 20-3 or something really low scoring.True that they've very done well so far. However, I think you have yet to play the best offenses you'll see this year. The Clemson game will definitely tell us a lot.&gt;Aug 10, 2015

I'm assuming OP was just linking this to pose the question.Not.

He's doing a great job, and I feel like UGA could end up shooting themselves in the foot if they fire him "in the hopes" that they get someone better. Then they could end up with a situation like Mike Riley at Nebraska or Sark at USC, basically a situation where you think to yourself "we didn't think this through".I think most of those UGA fans don't seem to realize that they are not a "destination program" in the same sense as many others. So, the likelihood of them hitting a home run and getting a coach that can deliver *better* than what Richt is already doing is at least somewhat slim.Fiesta vs Boise State.

Please no.I've actually been thinking about that matchup possibility for a while. I'd love to see how they handle the Clemson secondary.Starters: 

QB Malik Zaire - out for season

RB Tarean Folston - out for season

TE Durham Smythe - out for season

DT Jarron Jones - out for season

NB Shaun Crawford - out for season

Backups:

S Drue Tranquill - out for season, started against GT

S Avery Sebastian - ? but may be coming back for this next game (no longer on injury report)

---

Honestly, I think we could have done fine with the others out, but Malik going down has put the biggest hampering on the offense, and overall team and their attitude, IMO.That or a rematch with Clemson, even though I know it won't happen.Isn't that the same as what he basically said? Did you mean to say "what if we're just a decent team"?That or a rematch, pls. :'''(We already stole one guy, might as well take Bryan off your hands and add him to the ND staff. :pTennessee is remotely possible if Butch doesn't make a turn starting now, and they can come up with that kind of cash, too.If BK leaves, I would not be opposed to this.

Hey, maybe that's what the whole trip for that ND/Clemson game was actually for! /sLook at you with your non-season-ending injuries. Lucky bastards.Alcoholism isn't really that simple.STILL haven't played four quarters since the fucking Texas game.

Speaking of that, so far after this weekend, Texas just made themselves to look like the highest-quality win ND has had all year. Fucking Texas!&gt; JOSH \u201cAEROSPACE\u201d DOBBS

As a Vols fan as well, this is great.*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*Honest question, how many quarters did he play?Ah okay. I had no idea, truthfully.We kinda need to win, too, and....the 2nd half of our schedule looks rougher than the 1st half...with Temple, PITT, and at least BC's defense...and maybe Stanford.Well shit.Sanford seems to be doing amazing work in the QB coaching department. It's been put to the test this year already, too, sadly.Trigger warning, don't scroll through to the next article.

I need to go break things now.I'm sure BK forgot to think to himself "I have to please all the Clemson message board fans" before he said that. He most likely meant best Navy defense since he's been at ND.I doubt that. If so, that would be insane levels of inferiority complex, and Clemson already has a fair amount of it, somewhat understandably given some of the treatment by media, etc.He's part of a three-man team. Sanford, Denbrock, and BK all collaborate on play-calling duties. Frankly, you'd think it would fuck everything up, but they've all attested that it's amazing how well they work together.I like how this is written before the actual game between the two takes place.Possibly. But if he's part of a team that makes the CFP, which initially was looking like a possibility before all the injuries this year, then he'd have a bigger check mark on his resume. I think that was kind of the way it was maybe looked at.

Another possibility is that he considered being closer to his father at Indiana State, as well as the remote possibility that perhaps he saw BK leaving in a year or two, as others have considered as a projection. So perhaps he thought it could wait it out, and, if he delivered enough success, found himself in at least a Asst. HC position at ND, hoping to jump into the driver's seat as HC in 5-6 years? I dunno, just spit-balling ideas.

All sorts of possibilities, really. I'd say that even if he were looking to jump to a HC position in a couple years, both the money and the name of ND over BSU definitely increases his stock, though, no insult to BSU.No way this is going to be that big of a win. No way, none at all, nope.

^^^pls.I'm pretty sure all their players read TigerNet exclusively. /sWhile I can dream, this defense for MSU just isn't the same as the past few years. We'll see, though. Anything can happen when you hit the field.I'm not that overconfident. Their offense was also a bit hampered at times, too.I would love nothing more than to derail the "omg three shutouts" train.You look normal again, so that's nice.That guy's reaction is great. It's like when Bill Burr goes ".....well fuck it then..."Angry typing definitely helps. Can confirm.Child-like me: Wait....do they really do that in Texas if you just yell it out like that?I think your struggles as the game wears on also really comes down to the line depth you have, or lack thereof, not just letting the foot off the gas. Your skill positions are beautiful, but when the lines are playing a full game and you can't rely on the 2nd string to take some pressure off at times (especially defensively), your starters eventually get taken advantage of both with fatigue and the other team starting to recognize tendencies.

This is just what happens especially during halftime when the other team gets their ducks in a row, especially after adjusting to the environment. As far as your defense, the other team making adjustments especially helps when they know you can't throw a 2nd string defensive front at them like you had last year that gives some different looks at new guys with fresh legs. Most of Clemson's 2nd string defense last year could basically start at most schools. The same can't be really said for too many on that 2nd defense this year.He would have been RB3 anyway. Prosise was already taking 2nd team reps in the fall prior to the season starting, and so far Adams IMO would have replaced him at RB3 easily after a couple games in. Greg was a highly-rated bust, that I myself was REALLY excited about, and he's proven that with both his play on the field and his attitude. He had one great kick return that had everyone excited along with a few runs, but I'm not sold that that would have been the norm. And, Sanders is already seemingly delivering more consistently on kick returns/punts IMO, when he gets the blocking anyway.Losing Tuerk is probably going to suck for SC considering now his replacement (Rodgers, I think) has to contend with Tillery and Day. Should be interesting to see how often ND can blow up the middle and get a LB in there on a blitz, which BVG will definitely do.By beating OU, I guess.That...seems like the opposite of the best thing for UCF's football team.I think the weather limited both teams' abilities, so I'm not so convinced as to say ND would have won simply because of that.Never underestimate BK's ability to outcoach himself, too.Speaking to that talent, Ronald Jones is going to be tough to stop, no matter what they do. Luckily ND recruited him as well, so they're at least somewhat familiar with his abilities.Clemson's DL destroying ND's OL early on is what put a stop to that. It was really uncharacteristic of the ND OL, but they just weren't prepared early on for what Clemson has up front. They got it down a little later in the game, but early on with fresh legs, their DL was killing it.Relevant: ND hasn't played 4 quarters since the Texas game.You and yer silly conferences. 

:''(This makes no sense and it was amazing.Oh my god...my sides.[Harbaugh, obviously.](http://i.imgur.com/biDFHU0.gif)Nope, just Artavis Scott.

He's terrible. /s

Oh, and the 10 other WRs they have.HEY MARK, THEY SAID MSU WILL BE A CAKE WALK!!!!! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?! TELL THEM SATURDAY ON THE FIELD!

I think he heard me.[Yes, it will. Look into these eyes.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvVzNdOiVOM/maxresdefault.jpg)This is great. Hoping to make an LSU home game soon myself. I'm pretty sure I won't be able to handle all the liquor they throw around down there, at least anymore with my current tolerance levels being reduced.I just realized I only recognize him by his first name "Ifo".I'm just not up to LSU-level tolerance.YEEEEAAAAAHHH!

Frankly, I'm getting worried about our DL, though, after Day and Okwara leave.Congrats on that.He just looks like a child throwing a temper tantrum there.I think Folston would have better luck running than Prosise did against Clemson specifically, if he wasn't out, just because of his style of running, coupled with his blocking abilities with are far superior to any of the current active RBs.

Plus the QB run with Malik would have been a far bigger threat than it was with Kizer. It's a whole different offense, IMO, if Malik is there.

Jarron Jones coupled with Day up front would have been a far bigger disruption than the current DL was, even though Tillery and Cage have been decent in his stead.

Luatua was ND's best blocking TE, and he was out for that game, and it showed in a big way for the run game.

Smythe was also missed at TE, both for his blocking and also receiving abilities.Not that you mentioned him, but Norton being out was a godsend, as Guillermo is an upgrade from him.

Wiggins, Williams, and Reader were certainly losses, but that's 3 compared to ND's 5-6, one of which is the starting QB...kind of a big deal...still having to explain this to Clemson fans blows my mind.

Tell me Clemson would have won without Watson. One of the scores, the QB TD run after the 2nd half kickoff fumble, never would have happened.

You'd have to actually understand how ND's offense has now changed with Kizer at the helm compared to Malik to see what has changed, but I doubt you do.

And my 5-6 figure is leaving out Tranquill who proved himself against GT especially.Never said that he wasn't. But, you're seemingly saying that you're refusing to acknowledge what having a *True* dual threat does for an offense? It's an absolute game-changer by diversifying the offensive options/approach.

edit: Put Schuess in the game and tell me you get that Watson TD run with a straight face.Literally. :(Right, you are entitled to your opinion, but that displays the lack of a fundamental understanding as to how the QB run/read option changes the entire defensive approach (Watson being in there isn't just a threat because of his passing, also because of the way he can run the ball). Instead of a DL getting into the backfield and busting the RB alone, he and the others now have to stay honest and account for the QB pulling the ball and running himself (also with part of the onus being on the LBs). Not having to account for Kizer running like Malik made it easy to key on Prosise. It's a whole different game. This comes with an understanding of how the read-option works, which they cannot run anywhere near as efficiently with Kizer at the helm, although they still do run it from time to time and he does *okay*.

Stanley had a minor leg injury that probably hampered him from the UMass game (he went down at the half and didn't see much if any action in the 3rd and 4th quarters, IIRC), and again having the blocking of Luatua at TE out definitely helped your DL bust some run plays up. They played their asses off, don't get me wrong.

&gt;Shaq Lawson was in the backfield almost every snap and when he wasn't, he was held quite a bit  holding was rarely called on both sides, which was odd to me seeing as how both ND and CU held badly

As far as the holding, it keeps coming up that Lawson was held. I'm betting if I spent all my time looking for it, ND's DL was probably held on numerous occasions as well, but you're not really looking for Clemson holding ND, are you? (I can usually admit my bias. Can you?) Last I checked, ND wasn't the team saying "the refs better let us play". I'd say they were more likely consistent with both teams.

I agree that Kizer did a great job, but it's still True that with Malik it's just not the same offense and there are more options to defend.[Satire]You know this is satire, right? Please say "no" so I can laugh at you.1 Disrespect Added = +10 point margin of victory for MSU.

Am I doing this right?Looks like Michigan fans didn't come to play school today.The "Satire" notice was literally in the beginning of the article. So, how much did you read? Aside from none?I think most(?) of the fourth was with our backups, so I'm not sure.I'd say it means "inferiority complex". As of right now, I *do* think they deserve a top 4-5 billing, though.

This is probably just some master plan by Dabo to get them riled up. :pAnd they'd probably be wrong, because it'll be to a good opponent like FSU or whatever. The definition now has just gone on to mean "Clemson lost a game", instead of the original intended joke. Plus, on top of that, it's just old and busted at this point and needs to stay on the other shit forums across the internet instead of permeating the conversation of /r/CFB.

You realize everyone is waiting for certain teams to lose just so they can yell "told you so!" all over right now, right? OSU, ND again, Clemson, Alabama again, every major named team.Uhh, okay.Only tears now.Can we do it without a monsoon this time?Soonering. Get it right.Love that guy. /sHow bout that second flair of yours!THAT WAS RHETORICAL, MONSOON DENIED!No you wouldn't, nobody would.Uhh, wait, we can have Watson?HURRICANE WAS IN THE OCEAN, IT WAS A MONSOON.I'm not even sure where to begin on that KSU/TCU game. What the fuck.I think they just looked at the weather and just went "fuckit" and let everything unfold just to get out of there sooner, lol. Sucks because I really would have liked to see this game played without the weather and both teams at full strength.I'm pretty sure BK was kinda the same at one point later in the game last year. I think we really need this game back, if not just for the potential angry coach shenanigans.Welcome to every sports conversation ever.Ouch.More like Sleep Forest.The rational ones expected like 6-8 wins this year. With these shutouts, he's already delivered more than they can believe.You're going to call the guy you already gave the finger to?I'll just leave [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n1KPQmdddY) here.[Hey...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOpNKOK6i0)Russell Athletic Bowl win it is...Yep, Baylor and ND basically returned the most players this past offseason.Which is something they're working on for the future. Current schedules are decided years in advance, like ND scheduling UGA for 17 and 19 and OSU for like 2022 or whatever.

Just like SEC OOC scheduling is also getting better.Too bad nobody uses it correctly.I forgot this one was on Thursday. I can't wait to see this./r/titlegoreThis is what happens when I retire my pitchforking business.Jimbo's a cool dude.Seriously, last year was a clusterfuck of blame from Jimbo down to all the random FSU flairs on the subreddit.Wat.TIL Bert is James Harden.Welp.The hope is he'll get clean/sober and have a great comeback story. Sure, perhaps not at SC, but who knows?Watch him go to the NFL in a couple years.Not too many big names available right now that I can think of.Knee and shoulder injuries got him around the UVA game, out for season.This might actually be the only "home run hire" they can make right now. Other than that, I can't think of anyone else "available" that USC could pull, especially at this point. It's possible, I guess, that they let things ride until the end of the year where things become a bit clearer. And, frankly, I don't see Chip leaving.No, Joey Freshwater.Oh my god, no, please.I'd be surprised if he leaves TCU. Financially and recruiting-wise, he's in a very similar situation to SC. Great program support and a great recruiting state.NO!Yeah. Hoping he recovers and everything works out. Sucks because he's a great player overall. I had a feeling you were asking for a reason like this. :pObviously, endowment-wise, USC something-like triples TCU. But still as a football program, I think TCU pretty much has the financial backing to roll with almost anyone in the country. It depends on how far out on that limb USC is willing to go, which can only be assumed to be pretty far, and the timing of it as well. That said, as another factor, TCU has just done a fair amount of building of new facilities, etc. so that helps potentially keep Patterson there as well.I have no idea, but that doesn't ring any bells for me with the Vols' job. Perhaps he was mentioned randomly, though.http://i.imgur.com/EqgJ626.gifWithout the crystal footballs.I wonder if Harbaugh misses Cali? :(I feel like this is the only reason he suggested them, choosing to leave it up to someone else to complete it.Well shit. That saddens me.Were you also UCLA's #1 fan against ASU? Because this just might backfire on you.Yeah, he's reported and looked to be a hard hitter. Hoping that he's back on the field from here on out and we see a little bit of that.Dress adequately. You're not cool because you can "take the cold". It'll probably be just above freezing, according to the forecast, so the earlier game will be warmer, but don't be fooled. By the time 1030 or whatever rolls around, it's cold as fuck. Also says "few showers" possible, so take something waterproof.The watery crap is nothing like the ND Hot Chocolate of old.Given ND's past experience with this, TCU, I can say that at least you're building valuable depth for next year when completely different starters go down.I could go the rest of my life without seeing that idiot's face.Well, Strong just beat an undefeated top 10 OU team, their biggest rival, too. It's Strong.That getup he's wearing looks familiar. I don't like this one bit.Okay, the Vols fan in me still says Strong. UGA/Vols are typically close games, but they're not direct rivals, and UGA hadn't really played anyone yet before they met Bama (no offense to UGA), and it showed. Meanwhile, OU had already beaten two then-ranked teams coming into the RRS, Vols and WVU, and had a generally more impressive slate up until this past game.

Maybe that makes more sense.

edit: actually, let me clarify, UGA and Vols are considered "rivals" in some circles, but that's nothing like their GT or UF rivalries, and nothing like the RRSNot sure if talking shit about Texas or your own team.Shit...My god, Temple is going to potentially be 7-0 when ND goes out there. That is a bit scary.Back the fuck off, asshats.I imagine Swarbrick would do everything to prevent such a move.[Notre Dame Athletics Department right now](https://memecrunch.com/image/51ecc4b3afa96f24f1000001.jpg)Great read, but my reaction would be...same old story: just keep winning and stop caring what other people think. When you lose, you confirm a lot of people's biases."Don't know what you have until it's gone" applies here.When you're not a "destination program" (no offense) and you have a coach delivering the record Richt is with relative regularity in one of the toughest conferences, it would be silly to throw your hat in the ring "just because". Firing Richt with his record as of late would also be a red flag for coaches to avoid that place, too, if they were even considering it.I agree that it would be a very attractive job opening, but like I said...if you fire a dude who has the record Richt has had as of late...that's also a massive check mark in the negative column which makes prospective takers think twice.I'd say it's literally right on the outskirts. It's a GOOD HC gig, but it doesn't hold a candle to quite a few, I'd say, and is certainly not a blue blood...which is also the way I'm **partly** thinking of this. I'd say a job Oregon as a non-blue blood would even have a leg-up on them, with all that Nike help, too. Plus again, firing a guy with Richt's record puts a check in the minus column and makes coaches question the place a little bit, at least.I don't disagree with any of this.That's...not really relevant. And the answer is no, although I'm hoping to correct that soon.It's like the plight of Nebraska with Bo Pelini. Not stellar, but good seasons overall nonetheless. It's risky as hell when you fire a guy for being "not great", but then have to go with an unknown commodity. And then you may end up with your own 2-3 coach string of failures which may cause more harm than good. So it all depends on how things shake out with current openings and how they should time the UGA job coming open. If they do it this year or next, they could be contending with USC, next year potentially Texas if Strong doesn't deliver, Miami with Golden, all sorts of possibilities that might make it that much harder to get their "ideal candidate" when contending with programs with just as much or more pull.~~I think 2017~~ 2019 is in Athens. Ideally, that's what I'm hoping to make it down for. I'll have my bark-shield up. :p

edit: nope, 2019 in AthensSomething tells me there has to be much better "theater" coming out of the South.

And frankly, you seem to be excluding New Orleans jazz, which is a performance art form in it's own league.Miami with a fresh face and energy around the program will sell itself, IMO.

Use less coke, though.Absolutely.Well, Arkansas State is playing on Tuesday night, Gus came from there....sooo...that means something right?I mean, you could have actually lost to Jacksonville St. So there's your bright side.Fuck, don't tell /r/gaming.Personally, I'd like to know the perfect candidate that USC can get which will have them go 11-1 every year, with an annual loss to ND but a shutout of UCLA.Houston and Cincy are in the same boat there.Good, been waiting to hear about him coming back.Cmon, it'll be fun.This isn't surprising if you understand enough about Purdue Football. It's just what they do.What a coincidence...Anyone else leaves like this and half of /r/CFB would be losing their collective shit about how big of a dick move it was.Can't catch a break lately with those streaks.You can't hire yourself and your NCAA14 experience doesn't count.I will trade your records over the past decade.I'm okay with those bastards not operating where they can injure any more players.Now that Sark is out, literally all sights are on Haden. I wonder if he didn't see this coming.Now in the middle of the season it's going to be a month full of "OMG remember when Spurrier said...". Exactly what I was afraid of.

Commerce with the circlejerk.

edit: ..and downvotes of course for anyone who doesn't conform. Don't forget to hit up my entire profile page and get a couple pages at a time like some of you asshats have been doing.

edit2: to clarify, I'm not shitting on his actual career accomplishments, it would just be preferable to not have everything discussed  be about what he said and avoid his actual career accomplishments at multiple different programs. I give myself zero points for execution...and may god have mercy on my soul.I absolutely have the utmost respect for what his teams did on the field. Half of what he's celebrated for has nothing to do with that, though. That's what's frustrating.My god. What is this shit.I wasn't intending for that above to "Noneify" his accomplishments, in fact quite the contrary. I feel the exact same about his Duke, UF, and SCar tenures. His accomplishments are far more important than the "quotables" people refer to, which is what I meant...although my delivery was...poor at this hour.Well at least you're clean now.I wouldn't care if it didn't drive the conversation, and if you don't agree with the masses it skews the conversation. When a sub grows larger, as /r/CFB has in the recent years, it gets worse.

Even just a genuine observation/question of a program/thing that is "against a specific thread" gets hit if you don't praise them to kingdom come in the process. It's just that over the last ~3+ years it's noticeably worse than it used to be. Not much you can do but roll with it, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to call it out every once in a while when I feel like it.Stop suggesting Brian Kelly, please. This is the only time I will say it nicely.I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, he would switch to USC possibly right before Bama plays them to start 2016, which would be glorious to see. On the other hand, he'd be reconstructing a new Death Star that would be operational almost immediatebly and permanently orbiting ND.Wouldn't be the first celebrated program savior to do so. Snyder took his first "retirement" after two failed seasons when the going got tough, 4 and 5 wins respectively.Just saying there are parallels.It's been a crazy year. Now go back a week and a half and look at all the hurricane madness.

Ah well, I'm just going to sit here, grab a glass of wine, and wait to find out that we actually beat Clemson. Any minute now... :p

Now throw all the injury garbage for a pantload of teams on top of that. Fuck everything.

The theme of 2015 is simply "who the fuck is going to get out alive?"Guam isn't a state?! OH MY GOD!To be fair to you, nobody expected him to bail in the middle of the season.Okay that was gold. 

Should have said Ceres.We're going to have like 20 articles posted saying Coach O isn't a candidate.Pat Haden is a muppet.If the Vols beat them post-Spurrier, it's basically post-mortem, right?God, you say?

*Hmm.*Read half the shit I say (actually it's not recommended)...I understand. :pI...can't necessarily agree with this. USC is now just fine in the talent department, basically matching up with ND. Plus, some of the top talent ND has right now is leaving after this season, which is why BK emphasized the "this is the year" message. The question is more how many stay for their last year who have a year left but a high draft stock (Fuller, Jaylon, etc), and if they can prevent injuries next year, too.Easy. Utah doesn't remotely compare to TCU when it comes to recruiting grounds as well as program support, no disrespect to them. Simply put, TCU provides more reasons to stay when another program comes calling than Utah does. In addition, TCU has more room to match whatever anyone else would throw at their coach as far as salaries are concerned.
USC is USC

SCar is South CarolinaThis is the answer. Football-wise alone, South Carolina just plays second fiddle to Southern Cal.It's amazing to see someone actually come to this realization "in the wild". Also, you should probably hide now.Just stating a fact.I agree he's interesting that way, as that is the way I've always seen him. What I meant is that when you say he's not witty around here (or at least saying anything remotely similar to that), which he really wasn't, you tend to get a LOT of backlash.Wait...really?lolI wouldn't necessarily say that they're more open. It entirely depends on the quarterback, to be honest. Some QBs run limited sets to keep them in their comfort zones, especially if younger or newer to the system. Some QBs are given carte blache after they have proven themselves, so the playbook opens up. I'd say there are plenty of NFL systems that are run the same way.

As far as the triple option, the reason you don't see it is how dangerous/risky the play can be, both from a physical standpoint, i.e. a RB getting blindsided by an NFL-caliber LB when taking a pitch, and from the point of potentially losing the ball due to fumbles due to bad timing on a pitch. It's just too risky. Every so often you may see it run as a trick (I vaguely remember seeing it like once in the last 5 years), but it's just not worth it with all the other options you have, both passing and running the ball behind an NFL quality OL and with the RBs/WRs they have.Well at least it wasn't False information.

*I'll just see myself out.*&gt;500%

Whoa there.&gt; "le omg I'M ANGRY BLAH BLAH BLAH"

You're missing at least one "SEC".Pelini and Bert on the same staff would be....a sight to see.&gt;but isn't his personality compared to a cactus?

No, he's literally a cactus.Well at least they're letting him do a proper mic drop.Okay that would be amazing.Giving it a year both allows you to set things up and do it right as well as doing it "on the day" as an anniversary of sorts. That's the way I'd do it. If you try to rush it, I feel like it wouldn't be the greatest ceremony, etc.No. More like instant illegal play.Vacated wins are bullshit.Because everyone loves him, so saying anything negative about bolting in the middle of the year isn't allowed. We also don't know everything yet.This is True. However when it comes to conversation around this subreddit, he can literally do no wrong in the eyes of the masses. That's part of the reason why you see nobody questioning the move, because if you do you're automatically cast out.That's a perfect way to sum up how I feel about him, for some reason.Woo big win over Navy has ND back to 13!Three shutouts. They deserve one week.Basically a UCLA lock at this point.ONE week only!lol Game Thread.SETIf this year's record is any indication, that's a terrible bet.

*runs*Vegas doesn't know shit about the run ....of the mouth....game.100.0And awaaaay we gooooIIRC a similar situation was said to exist at LSU during the offseason, but it's not the kind of debt one might think of like personal debt. Not sure, though.McCord, look at that ball fly!Still hungry, eh?

*BREAKING: Urban Meyer to retire from Ohio State effective immediately*Wait, did he just say Spurrier's legacy will be SCar's "Sandstorm enthusiasm"?He said he's not retiring?

**Spurrier to USC confirmed.**I can't wait to fucking leave this hellhole and I'll be happy as fuck that day.To be fair, nobody will openly say that, to avoid burning any bridges."Our team wasn't as good as I thought we were going to be."

:|lol["I'll have something to do every day."](http://d3f5994kvuwcz1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/spurrierball.jpg)0-6 UCF can't catch a break."Let's get moving.." aka "I have a tee time, you fuckers."Wait, do you mean this in a good or bad way?What's the general feel on Tanner, good or bad?I mean, half of the subreddit are acting like Spurrier is dead, so it fits. :p"Lay it on the line"

Oh shit...We Are Marshall confirmed.Don't watch the chatroom.

edit: you fuckersYou mean Spurrier leaving or something else besides that?

edit: i keep forgetting asking for clarification isn't allowedLou's a great coach, one of the best, but he was at the end of his career when he went down to SCar. He also doesn't always bring in the greatest character players.USC and ND hired guys with roots in their school. I'd be careful.Well, I was judging that by the fact that my question got multiple downvotes without an answer just for wondering what you were specifically talking about. Yay /r/CFB.It would be silly for Dantonio to leave for SCar. It's a lateral if not somewhat downward move, program-wise. MSU isn't just good at football now, they also have a great Basketball program as well. The entire athletics "complex" of the school is doing quite well. The same cannot be said for South Carolina.Just saying consolidating everything in a sticky that happened yesterday might be a good idea, given the magnitude of all those events.I'm waiting for Haden to get so bad that it turns into Mchigan/Brandon 2.0 and I start feeling bad for USC.Don't lie.Not right away, but some people would eventually come around and they'd at least avoid having to tell you to stfu about how great you are. :pI would support this move, if it works.The most practical is that he'll probably become an analyst of sorts on ESPN or whatever. Doesn't even have to make regular appearances, just during the season once a month/week or something.Yeah, that was another logistical part of it. Stuff like this, if you want to do it RIGHT, takes time. I've been part of setting up such events before, and when it's rushed, it feels that way when it happens and it's kinda shitty. When it's planned, things run mostly smoothly and all goes well, nobody is panicking, etc. It then becomes an overall enjoyment for everyone to take part in, which should be the goal.He definitely at least needs to do a show with Feherty some time soon.Well what the hell, now I remember vaguely this happening...Well, maximum hilarity for USC would be stealing either Mora or BK.

Maximum hilarity for SCar would be stealing Richt and then going on to beat UGA for like 10 years in a row, or stealing Dabo and doing the same to Clemson.I meant more "by comparison to MSU", not in the sense that "SCar has bad athletics". They're definitely improving. As of right now, for SCar BB, I just remember Devan Downey off the top of my head. Had a couple great games but I can't remember who they were against now.All this before they lose to Northwestern this week, IU as well. :p

&gt; go winless for the rest of the season.

&gt;with a perfect record.

uhhhHe then changed it to lossless, and now finally undefeated. :p[...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l8HHPrQuj08/UFHoFiGMxWI/AAAAAAAAC4U/CZP4l20VFx0/s1600/john-lackey.gif)The team just isn't that good.I'd say there's at least enough of them that believe this kind of stuff to fill the Shoe.I think the Fighting Hawks logo could be the start of a really slick design if it were sharpened up, and would look pretty good on a helmet.

I like the name North Stars for some reason, but picking an actual physical mascot you can have seems like a better idea.Hey, I said the same about Alabama, not intending to offend. I'm still not sold on their ability to get through without at least one more loss. I saw 9-3 coming into this year, in part not because of anything specifically bad they've done, but mainly because some other opponents may be better, namely LSU and perhaps playing @A&amp;M this weekend becomes a tough game. Then again, I was riding the Arky wagon for a short while after the way they finished the year. Loss of a RB really hurt them, IMO, though.Hell yeah, nice tie in there. Angles and whatnot can always be tweaked on those points to sharpen the look of it.God dammit.Chop block is when a man is blocking low while another goes high. Cut block is where you just basically go for a block at the legs, like when RBs block a blitzing defender out of the backfield.

And I think it was far enough away from the actual ball that there was no reason to dive at his legs, especially from the side/behind like that.Looks like clipping, almost, really.You can't chop block anyone. Period.Something tells me he knows.I keep telling everyone Notre Dame is the greatest football team in the country, Michigan State second, Tennessee third. They should believe me because there's no way I'm biased.-_-"Just accept my 'FIRED' invite on Outlook."Bill SpurierWhere In The World Is Sark In San Diego?\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afDoes "Everyone vs ND" count?[Serious] So, do players get paid for their picture being put on the front?It's been an hour.OSU, ND, and MSU were all in the top 5 just a little while back.

Damien McMama (likes Big Macs)http://i.imgur.com/NQHKSVE.gifIf so, my Master Plan worked far better than I could have dreamed.Alabama could beat the Patriots.I could see Joe Schmidt, ND's current MLB, becoming a long-tenure head coach somewhere.It's good to hear that he got great recognition and that there's solid support behind him. Hopefully for them, USC doesn't fuck up this relationship like they did Coach O, interim or not.

I'm honestly getting the feeling this USC team is going to come out really ready to play on Saturday.Depends on where that staff is by then.Martinez and Ragland are both MLB/ILB, typically, IIRC, Schobert is your lone OLB. I get that Schobert has had a good year, IIRC, but leaving Jaylon Smith off in favor of him is borderline criminal.


This is of course just my opinion and 2 cents.You spelled NCAA14 wrong.I FOUND HIM!How dare you.I don't like this game.It was definitely a shitty move.Yeah I wasn't trying to take away from him, but it may have come off that way. In Jaylon's case, there's a whole lot of "running away from him" going on right now with the teams we play, too.UGA fans  (and others) took exception yesterday to me saying it wasn't a "destination job" quite like these were. An Auburn fan told me to "take off [my] Notre Dame goggles".

LSU also needs to be on there, IMO, but I can see either side of the argument there, I guess.No, that was the year. Alternates locations each year, so it'd have to have been 2003 if it was the game prior in ND Stadium.

edit: actually, hold on, that may not have been the year, now that I think of it...

edit2: now I think that was it. :/Fending off the elusive 2-4 haters errday.Purdue was always fun.I was all set for a nailbiter.New to mid-week CFB? You gon' learn today!14[Come on man](http://giant.gfycat.com/SpecificVigilantAdmiralbutterfly.gif)Yeah, when it's out there, it's the last game of the year, when it's in South Bend, it's in the middle of the season.This has been posted many many times already.It tells the team when to cheat and when not to cheat.:(Kessler since Malik got hurt, sure.

You'd be a fool to swap Prosise the way he's playing right now for either RB Jones or Madden

Adoree yes as a CB

As a WR perhaps Juju, but you'll have a hard time selling anyone that he's better than Fuller

No way anyone on ND's OL would be replaced with Damien Mama, regardless of his size, with the way they are playingIrony. That is all.Ehh, I think since it's on NBC they won't be spending that much time on old USC coaches. If it were ESPN/ABC, I could see it more. Then again, Flutie &amp; Co always surprise me.That and people just run away from you, literally. Jaylon Smith is getting similar treatment right now.ND's home crowds have been far better this year, in part due to the added construction. So, that combined with a night game should hopefully have the ND players ready to go, ideally channeling their Texas performance.Michigan is fucked now.He's not THAT evil.Holy crap, that was amazing. I need to see more of this.&gt;Bret Bielema has no comment ~~after loss.~~They fucked a bunch of MormonsI hope he grows a moustache some time soon.On second thought, let's not have a drinking game for this one...or any other one.Yeah, we know he's totally cheating. Official NCAA Reddit account /u/NCAAInvestigations has been notified. Don't worry, we'll catch this ruthless bastard.All ND has to do is come out fast.

Like they totally did in all their other games. :(This is great for the Temple program. Happy to see they are doing well. The second half of ND's schedule is turning out to be much tougher than the first half.While it's very petty, it does drive the conversation one direction or another.Actually, it's weird, the month of January 2013 was cancelled. I don't make the rules, it was Mayans.There's a match-up discussion thread for just this reason.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3oncct/week_7_matchup_discussion_thread_8_michigan_state/That really depends on the game.This is why you watch mid-week CFB.They literally never tell the full story.That was a great video, the DK intro especially. Please hide it from USC.

*Hmmm...*I'd be surprised if it was THAT easy against USC with the renewed energy they could come out with. But, given the spread of like 6.5, I think ND *can* cover that.http://replygif.net/thumbnail/603.gifI think they'd be hard-pressed to not put UM and ND together if we end up with similar records at the end of the year. That would be great...as long as your defense doesn't play quite as well as they have been.He's slated as an OLB, but in the 4-3 Over (could be Under now that I think about it) ND can run, that finds him more of an ILB positioning at times. Schmidt is the straight-up MLB. Yeah, we lost Jarron Jones before the year started, too.Announcing that he's taking the USC job.Damn. Am I thinking of Nebraska, or did this happen with someone else, too, this year just like a week ago? Texas maybe?I can still see in my mind the leaping catch a PSU WR made inside the 5 during that game.Please let this happen.[Fuck you, 30 for 30.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/62P8_Ik7NlE/hqdefault.jpg)All he needs now is an award winning offensive line.Not gonna be smiling this weekend.


^^^plsIt's not that one...I don't think...that I'm thinking of. There was one with them going the same direction, but it was at the top of the field.Embrace it, it's fun.

Cmon man. You're not going to lose. It's at home, and Baylor really never loses at home. There's absolutely zero chance WVU could pull this off. Your team is heads and shoulders above them. You should just lie down and take a nap during the game on Saturday, because there's no reason to be worried. After all, it's not like WVU has beaten Baylor recently.Yeah, I think it's the one in the 4th I'm thinking of, which led to them tying the game. That catch is what's standing out in my mind, I think.IIRC, that would be the one where he threw literally everything into the dirt for the entire half. It's like he wasn't even a QB.Kizer is "mobile" but he's not killing you with his feet like Malik could.

&gt;the Center got worked and he eventually quit the team.

Jesus, well, we caused Texas to make staff changes, I certainly hope we don't cause a USC player to quit.

&gt;but looking at the team's current performances, I don't see how they can beat ND this year.

Look no further than your overall talent and some of the renewed energy your interim is bringing. I don't think they'll be as bad as you think.Welcome to ND Football every year.We'll find out real quick here soon.*posted by a UGA fan*

I love seeing people post bad news about their rivals.Plus, I think that if they fire a coach with Richt's kind of success, that makes other coaches a little more cautious, given his record.&gt;Checkered Orange &amp; White Brick Road

FTFYHow many completely neutral coaches, if given a choice, would pick UGA over USC? Especially if Haden is out soon.&gt;... Holy shit why had I not thought of this?

Because you're not very smart, you're a Michigan fan. ^^^Might ^^^as ^^^well ^^^get ^^^started ^^^now, ^^^right?

&gt;That would be an awesome match up. 

Yes, yes it would.
Who knows. It's possible that they talk about him a lot, but also possible they don't really discuss him that much to avoid associating with a guy who may be on the way out.I don't disagree that it is one of the top jobs, but it's not one of the premiere jobs. In my mind, there's a difference.You spelled "Yes" incorrectly. It's okay, rookie mistake.

This thread has no purpose.How much do you know about autism?I'm trying to figure out if OP is an Ohio State fan in disguise.It got popular.Just my random thoughts, then...

Makes sense. I feel like what's happening here is that you have all these symptoms/random knowledge in your head of the disorder that seem to line up, and you're trying to project that onto Jim because you're seen a few things from time to time that he does which might match. Somewhat akin to when a hypochondriac reads about a disease and instantly thinks they have it because a few things match up with how they're feeling.

Have you met and interacted at length with Jim Harbaugh personally? Because that's typically what really gives you an insight as to whether or not one might have such a disorder, not just watching them from afar and in a few snippets here and there. Everyone can seem to have a disorder if you only seem them in certain emotional/awkward situations, which coaching a major CFB program would deliver on a semi-regular basis.

Then again, you probably already know this if it's your field of study.I thought you were referring to the Wazzu game, so I had to look it up. Holy shit, UNT.Gotcha. FYI, it's a weird thing to see in this sub, because this basically devoted to actual football news, so that's why posts like this, even though it's ABOUT a coach, will get removed and get that reaction.NOOO NOT BLAKE BARNETT! Hope he's okay.We REALLY need help on the DL now since Sheldon is leaving, IMO. The more they have, the more they can rotate guys in. I'm really hoping Jay Hayes gets himself out of the doghouse and starts to deliver on his potential, too. Jones having the injury, as much as I hate to say it, may have helped keep him here for 2016. Also, same could be said for Folston, as the word from many was he was looking to "get out" after this year.It is....but to a degree. Asking if a coach autistic is...a little out there. This would have probably been better received during the offseason, FYI.Yeah we did this earlier. And here I thought we were done saying that word for this week.Uhm, OP, you're going to need to be more specific.

edit: that's better. For the record, OP didn't link the image until just a second ago.Boo you.I wonder if they remember what happened with A&amp;M/Bama last year.That's clearly not it. He didn't even form any complete sentences in the body of the post posing any questions. Wait a minute...I'm wondering if the reason the ND/Stanford end-of-season games are packed is not more because of ND fans in Cali than Stanford fans showing up.If ND is in the CFP, I want a Clemson rematch first.This conversation about "2-loss CFP teams" has to stop. It should be looked at as "11-win or better" teams. Again, the committee values wins over losses, as has been pointed out countless times. So, it would be very easy to see a team that won their conference, going 11-2, getting in over, say, a Baylor team with a record of 11-1. It's the same number of wins, and potentially with a tougher overall (and OOC) slate (at this point in time, until it inevitably gets better for Baylor in the next couple years). Plus, the earlier in the year the two losses happen, the better, obviously. If you drop a close one in week 1 and then another close one in the middle, then go on a 6-7 game win streak, then win your conference, it's not farfetched, IMO, that you get in. It also doesn't always come down to who wins their conference, although that is the understated goal of the committee. Ultimately, as they say, they will "choose the best 4 teams, regardless of conference".I don't know, but cancelled games are a special situation that are pretty rare. The possibility that a team both has exactly two losses and also had a game cancelled both happening in one year is just plain remote.

&gt;Well thats not fair.

To address that point, nothing is every totally "fair". Literally with any "selection system" someone will get left out who "feels they had a right to a spot", and someone will be annoyed about it. If you luck out and get in with 2 losses fine, but don't bitch if you get left out of it since you couldn't deliver through the entire year (same goes for 1-loss IMO for the B12). Once you get the first loss, you've already allowed someone else to decide your fate. This is why I truly believe that outside of outlandish situations where teams drop like flies, ND (and current B12 contenders) should assume they MUST roll undefeated to get a spot, unless their conference membership status changes.Talk about an interesting series. Whoever becomes Snyder's replacement should be pretty excited, too, about that 2021 game.There's really very few. It's a far smaller circle than some are making it out to be. "Top 10-15 jobs" includes a subcategory of 5-6 programs that are basically in their own league. Some don't like to hear this, which is understandable given that they feel their program is being slighted when left out. There's top tier, and then there is the apex of programs, which are a subset *within* the top tier that really only match up with each other.

I'd say that comes down to, off the top of my head:

USC, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Alabama, Texas, Michigan.

That's pretty much it.

You'll probably take this as a slight on UGA, but let's be honest, those schools are in a league of their own as for what they can offer. Put UGA up against any of them individually with a completely neutral coach (no ties to either program/area) making a choice, and there's a *pretty* clear advantage to those programs.

Again, I mean no offense.Right, but that would imply ties to a specific area, though, which is why I said "completely neutral" coaches.

I agree on everything else.I, too, am aware of that circlejerk. I chose to avoid it.Fuck'em.First you dial up a hurricane for your biggest game of the year, next you're using helicopters as a device to gain an advantage in the tailgating game as well.

Clemson, biggest fuckin' cheaters I've ever seen.I still can't get over how great that field condition looked with the conditions the way they were.He was a special Aggie.Not sure. I'm sure I'll be drunk one night and remember, only to blindside you with it.Something tells me this isn't going to be very fun for Oregon.&gt; off the top of my head

&gt;Coach Meyer, I'm wondering if we can convince you to come to Nebraska by offering you all the U.S. currency in circul-hello?I'm a little miffed I'll miss most of this game until the end because of focusing on the ND/USC game. But it's perfect that it is at night.It's funny, ASU is actually like Utah. They can look absolutely horrid sometimes and then come out and play like a championship team.

No clue what's going to happen here, but I can't wait to watch it!How exactly did the "quietly agree" to do this? Just curious.Well, BK talked all about his depth before the season started. That worked out well.At least it gets rid of all the casuals. :pTrash Talk Thursday

It's literally a thing. See the [Weekly thread schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/wiki/weeklythreads).Then you could also go do this in the Match-Up discussion thread for your game.

[Found here, posted 2 hours ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3orpa8/week_7_matchup_discussion_thread_oregon_washington/)

Just saying it's a little redundant.Fucking BleacherReport. This is pure speculation based upon the opinion of a random "NFL doctor" that they won't even name that hasn't even examined him, at least that's what I gather from the dude in this video, whoever he is.

To clarify: Yes, I fucking hate that website.FYI someone else posted just before you, same story.Every BR post should get mandatory POOP flair.*Welcome to the Nick Chubb Injury Update slideshow! Slide 1 of 20, Click next, please.*Matt Leinart with Reggie Bush in pursuit.Hey....fuck you. :pAs a Bears fan, hell yes.I think he may just be in the Florida/Georgia Hall of Fame.Leinart was the ballcarrier, Reggie pushed, FYI.And all they did was basically plug in Zack Martin.Apparently, we can't even talk about this in an unbiased fashion. You're massively overrating your own players like they're all Superman based upon a few individual plays and it's that simple. He "destroyed Stanley in the running game" in a couple individual plays alone very early on, that's it. And part of the reason for that would be half of ND's OL dealing with injuries and the best blocker at TE being out as help on that side of things, while your players have over two weeks rest for that game.All I did was point out the context and situation in that post above.I don't get it. Dabo did an amazing job this year, but they've had 5 consecutive 10+ win seasons in a row under him. Ferentz went from barely being bowl eligible to the B1GCG and being a CFP contender this year. If we're handing it out to non-Iowa teams, it could be argued that BK should have gotten it, given how well they rolled with the injuries and prepped all of ND's young guys as replacements.Yeah but it's Richard Sherman, and because large numbers of people hate him mostly simply for being as good a player as he is, that means that he's clearly way off base. It's basically the same as people hating the big program names in CFB.

Stanford bias or not, he's not that far off.Last I checked this is "Coach of the **year**", not something that's supposed to be judging one's career as a whole. And you don't know that for sure, regardless of recent patterns.Couldn't quite use his former running back skills there.Easy choice, IMO. Dude's going to be crazy the rest of his career.Step 1: Get fired from UGA

Step 2: Profit, literallyI could see a 12-0 B12 Champ getting left out, depending on who it is, in favor of a 12-0 ND though, if their schedule quality were to remain the same. In fairness, though, they're already taking measures to increase SOS. I mean, frankly, we already saw a 1-loss ND ahead of Baylor and OkSt earlier this year, too, so there's at least a little bit of precedent there in the committee's eyes.Shocking news. This would be great to see them put together a FB program.*wanders over to AL.com*Any reasoning provided?JJ eventually has to live up to his preseason Heisman. Surely next year is the year!Which makes it a bit more perplexing, given that it's not even AT Clemson.Too hard. They were hoping to take the Ba-(notices flair) uhh nevermind.Some day soon, I swear I'm going a drive throughout the north earlier in the season (less shitty weather) to get to games in Fargo, Missoula, Boise, and ultimately Seattle.Although Louisiana gets carved up pretty well to an extent by other teams.Wait, is that happening?Honestly, if the losses on the OL prove to be enough that protection isn't as good as it is this year, then Malik is going to be the better fit anyway, given the fact that he's a bigger threat to beat you with his feet in an overall sense, provided the injury recovery goes well. Couple that with just HOW good he is at the read option, how fast he is, and how he leads the offense both on and off the field, and that's an awesome combination. It's going to suck to see either of them relegated to the backup role.If I have faith in anyone knowing what they're doing, it's Swarbrick.Well that is interesting isn't it. Must've gotten his memory back. Fully admit I jumped on the "fuck frats" wagon in that initial thread pretty quickly.There was video? I only saw a still picture where he leaned in on someone else's photo.I *believe* so, but either way this is kind of absurd the lengths they're going to.&gt;mostly

Right, I get his attitude is the other reason.BRB getting my lunch pail.I love when we get questions on /r/cfb to which they could find the answer in an even shorter time by Googling it.

I'm guessing literally none of these people work in IT.[From their Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMG_Academy):

&gt;IMG Academy is a **private athletic training institute** for youth, high school, collegiate and professional athletes located in Bradenton, Florida.


That's what they are, so of course their facilities are going to be sick. Same as like a military school might have a full rifle range on site, because it's part of who they are.https://i.imgur.com/wd8UydF.gifApparently it's /r/CFB during the offsea-all the time now actually.Which Norman is "Thee Norman"?I thought that said "ten year" and had flashbacks.It's okay. I do not.Seriously, it's not that hard to understand.You didn't hear? He's transferring. Wants a chance to actually win a championship, even if it means a late-game punt block is in order, and at least an outside shot of beating OSU.Join the club?

:pSaid a time or two before that I'd love nothing more than to see Jaylon Smith + Reggie Ragland in a LB corps. That'd sure be interesting.It's almost like you have to watch the games to understand exactly what's going on.*voice cracks*That's just to let you know that you're on a quality site.His flight to Arizona is not mandatory. Please leave him home.I think absolutely egregious PI should be spot of the ball, like when Fuller was flat out tackled twice by USC because they simply couldn't cover him, one of those at least was Adoree Jackson but it may have been both. If you think about it, it really is BS that a dude can flat out fucking tackle a guy and get nothing more than 15 yards, especially given where some of these penalties happen.

[He hasn't moved since.](https://bigtennetworks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/usatsi_8306221.jpg)Damn I miss that dude.My concern is that it'll end up being Zeke vs Joe Schmidt far too often. In which case, we're fucked.Keep that idea in your pocket for the offseason after all the bowls are over, would be fun to revisit.That's the point. Take it away and you force them to actually play, and if they just plain get beat, then that's the way it is and they're not good enough to stick with their man.You're fucking joking, right?

Wait a minute, houndstooth jersey and pants. Yeah, that's not happening.&gt;Class of 2017

So much time for things to change, anyway.[Kizer to Fuller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0NmV03xf9Q)

Without this, a lot of things could have taken a bad turn. Some people incorrectly call it a hail mary, that shit was perfectly on target.

[Uhh, For Michigan State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBlgN85wB6U)So Ohio State would have played Iowa.If ND doesn't fail the earlier two point conversion, they wouldn't have needed the one at the end of the game, so it could be said that it's that one. That said, I don't think you would have lost any other games even if ND managed to win, and you may still have found yourselves in the CFP.&gt;painfully aware

Drinking heavily can be much more painful in the long run.If you get brought down by Rudy, you don't deserve an offsides call.8-4 considering all the injuries they've suffered and general lack of an OL really is pretty impressive, if you actually look at who they lost to: OU (in OT), Grier-led Florida (led going into the 4th, dammit), Arky (lost by 4), and Alabama (close the whole way, just couldn't stop their last drive).It isn't like they got blown out in any of their losses, either, couple that with the injuries.If Jaylon Smith somehow joins the Packers, I will not be a happy man.And, you know, half of their offense being Elliot. If you can run like that, any remotely decent QB should be able to develop a bit of a passing game. Cardale was probably the most overrated player from a fanbase I've seen in recent years. All that crap about how he can throw shit from his knees and he did some shit during halftime of a spring game, like that remotely matters.Well yeah. My main question is whether Jaylon will return, that's really my only concern, along with Fuller who has already eluded to a return. But, sometimes these things change when you see other players around you taking off.I think there's SOMEthing that says he could have returned for 2016. No chance risking it anyway when it looks like you might be the top LT taken.Call Dabo for pizza.Please continue this philosophy in the Fiesta Bowl.He really just needs to get on BK's level when it comes to OL recruiting. Having amazing RB and QB recruits won't make a damn bit of a difference if you can't block for them, as ND has shown this year with all the replacements doing what they've done behind this OL. If he can pull just a few guys like we've been getting year after year, it'll work wonders, ESPECIALLY against the some of the defensive fronts that can give fits in that conference.Auburn fans would be going "lol 42-14" all over Bammers like all the halfwits that were doing it after 2012.&gt;Alerjammahs 

Come on.Charlie Weis is their coach.Between and Alabama and Ohio State, no fanbase as a whole (not ALL of their fans) needs a bigger dose of down years than those two right now.I doubt it. Les already addressed the fact that things need to change after this year. Plus, on the Texas front, they're looking to make changes on offense and they have some really young players this year, along with a bunch of injuries to top it off.&gt;mid 200's debacle

*The year was 252 A.D.*....*Alabama had just suffered their second losing season....*Was announced a day or two ago, FYI. Probably just yesterday and everything is running together for me.

edit: apparently there are different COTY awards, perhaps.http://media0.giphy.com/media/WiyczarN2XMm4/giphy.gifWell god dammit. How many COTY amards are there?I was going to say, someone managed to do a bang up job keeping this all private, if there really are major issues.Yeah, I think so. Too many awards now, lol.This would be a big loss for OSU in the Fiesta Bowl.

^^Better ^^sit ^^him ^^for ^^the ^^first ^^half ^^to ^^teach ^^him ^^a ^^lesson.I will trade you tiers of clusterfucks.All kidding aside, I don't think he should really be disciplined by the school. It's a legal issue and nothing that's really all that damned bad. He didn't hurt anyone or anything like that, and I'm assuming it wasn't a direct violation of any already-outlined team rules."See officer? I didn't pay for sex."I saw on TV they have codewords and shit for different things.At least the woman he was soliciting most likely exists.If it were only about wins and losses, I'd have an iPhone.Well I'm excited.This is gonna be terr-oh that wasn't bad.I'm still unsure what to think of Boudreaux. I honestly have my doubts that with his little commitment schtick and how highly touted he was that he'll be that good.Uh, why? (oh wait, didn't he commit/decommit from USC)Yeah, remember the commit now. But seeing that is great.Michigan fans began to claim they "didn't want him anyway" once it was looking like they weren't going to get him.[You can go to hell.](http://i.imgur.com/PPMD5.jpg)&gt; who makes something like that for a highschool football commit? 

[Not ND OL commit Parker Boudreaux, that's for sure.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doO8JuxdyRY)Yeah, I have no idea what is going on with them. I really hope they stop doing this, at least for ND guys. That's...really not what it's supposed to be about.Well, I mean they have more top 25 wins than [insert ranked team you want to crack a joke about here]Let's hope BVG actually starts developing them. Morgan at this point is a question mark, and frankly I'm really wondering what the hell is going on with Asmar Bilal, too.I thought they were off the top of my head a while back when he did the USC commit at least.He did, yes. I think two, and also IIRC he's the one that moved around a bit, which might have been their biggest concern, between Cali and Detroit.&gt;Pitt's athletic department will pay for all out-of-pocket costs that are not covered by Conner's family insurance, partly through the department's athlete insurance policy with UPMC and the rest from their general fund.

This is the best news of the day.Well shoot. I had no idea they RS'd him.Define "healthy"?

Jarron Jones, DT who has been out all year, will be back, probably more in a supporting role.

Durham Smythe, TE who has been out since UVA, will be back, too.

Prosise, the RB who played most of the year, should in theory be back, but True freshman Adams has been a solid fill in guy.

OLB Onwualu should be back in the lineup, but Martini has been a solid stand-in 

S Tranquill, QB Zaire, NB Crawford, RB Folston, reserve WR St. Brown, backup LG Bars, CB Russell are all basically guaranteed out.And frankly, Martini is looking to be the better OLB, mainly in part due to him actually being a "career" OLB in a sense, although Onwu has looked amazing for a converted WR. Jarrett should be interesting, but I think he's out after this year, no?

Hayes has the best chance to be a combo standup-DE, rather than "hand in the ground", and OLB, most likely, IMO. And that combination fits well with the 4-3 setup (4-3 Under, I believe where Jaylon's "OLB" position is actually more behind a DT, almost like a 2nd ILB) they're trying to run, although that could also switch up a bit even with Jaylon's departure, as one of the reasons they went with that at times is because they wanted to set Jaylon up more in the middle of the field so teams can't literally just "run away" from him.Did I say *anything* about the integrity of college athletics as a whole?I'm still having trouble forgiving Chris Brown for just not going down inside the 5, given the weather. He HAD to try for more. That said, I get it, because he was doing what he thought was best for his team.I get that he's made them look good this year, but it's the first year. Last time I saw a coach get a big old contract extension in his first year, it didn't work out too well. That is not to say that I don't believe Narduzzi is going to do quite well at PITT.I'm okay with this if it means they're no longer a thorn in ND's side at all the wrong times.&gt;[:(](http://cdn1.theodysseyonline.com/files/2015/09/20/6357838580357014281910227076_sad%20uva%20fan.jpg)

ftfy &lt;3They're called Rudy.He doesn't catch properly, but the question is whether or not anyone is going to change that habit/ability or not. If there's no plan to work with him on it then what's the point? This also depends on how this year's and next year's WR stock looks, obviously.There's only one alternative: 8 teams. 8 is the sweet spot.

6 teams will not work because the idea of first round BYEs is terrible, and anything more than 8 just gets too convoluted and includes teams that really don't deserve to be in the conversation.Or like where some of them are. As some BSU fans can attest, there's nothing good about playing in Boise in December.Yeah. And most of them happened before our Week 5 meeting.

Imagine how hilarious it was to have some of your fellow fans dredging up and responding to our months-old preseason conversations where I said that ND would beat you guys. I could not have foreseen this many injuries to key positions (Zaire especially was rather unexpected), especially not that early in the season. And we lost starting OL Nelson during the game, in the first half, and I think one or two other OL were nursing high ankle sprains in that game, one being LT Stanley, all the while playing against a team with just over two weeks rest.

Anyway, Happy Cake Day!Go away. :(That's it?

&gt;Glenn Schumann\u2019s exact role on Kirby Smart\u2019s new football staff isn\u2019t defined yet, but his salary is.

"So, what  would you say...ya do here?"I didn't think it was an exact position coach. I was thinking when I put "that's it?" that is was just "assistant coach", as in like #2 to the HC.I meant season record-wise, something OSU hasn't had any struggles with recently, really.I had a minor heart attack.The teams we thought would be good were bad and the teams we thought would be bad were good.

edit: changed hard/good easy/bad

&gt;Who would you like to play next year that wasn't on your Schedule?

Michigan, I'd like to play Michigan next year. :'(Better hope UNC doesn't have a GT-like implosion next year, though. They actually lose Williams after this year, IIRC.

Really enjoyed that Clemson/UGA series.I listened. &lt;3I hear Clemson is good at riling up their fanbase and players by creating narratives with out of context quotes from opposing players, so I'm sure you'll be fine. :pAnd now this makes me paranoid for Avery Sebastian.Bobby Diaco vs Upstart FBS program UMass

Aww yiss.IIRC, he was shown on the Opening drills and 7 on 7s. Very solid hands, great route runner, and a big catch radius, solid size. If he sticks, that's a truly impressive pickup for Houston.*Searches the record books...*

*Still searching...*Notre Dame had such a great BYE week in 2005 that they decided to give Charlie Weis an insanely stupid contract extension.&gt;"the"

For "the" OSU fans.Their spending is crazy, like top 3 in the country. I had no idea it was that high, but one has to wonder if that'll all come crashing down at some point.How dare you mention that man's name.This should be a new post flair, just for this one if nothing else.I have heard that about Trub, but we'll see. A lot of fans will say that when a guy struggles a little bit, though, lol. (\u256f\u00b0 \u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253bRB Josh Adams

*If for some reason Jaylon Smith returns, he might have a ridiculously outside shot of winning.And he I am just longing for Malik to come back, lol.Speaking of that, is Schotty actually *staying*?There should be hats for "tiers" of regular season record, like 6-6 through 8-4 teams and 9-3 through 11-1 teams, or some bullshit like that.[Done.](http://i.imgur.com/3AYmw0y.png)On the one hand, the addict in me says "no fucking way", on the other hand, there are a ridiculous number of bowls.I can't hear you.That's kind of what I figured. Any idea who they're realistically looking at?That's text, not sound. I still can't hear you.Not interesting? I don't think you understand what I mean by "addict".he fits in well around these parts, then.Holy fuck.I'm not putting him up there because we have no idea what to expect from him after a full year off from injury.It's not intentional, I apologize.Why wouldn't it stick? Because recruiting is crazy, that's why. I think you're reading too far into that phrase, as I'm not trying to say there's a big chance of him reversing this decision, just that as long as they hold onto him it'll be great.A while back around the time of his USC commit, IIRC.No, just no.Hop on that.Actually ND has 3 top 25 wins: Temple, Navy, USC

Close, though!Then all they need to do is get permission from schools to use their names again, which may be part of the problem, too. Licensing and all that, IIRC.Aaand we're done here.Some Aggies didn't like it when I said a while back that most of their success was because of Manziel alone and had really nothing to do with Sumlin.

I think he's really an overrated coach who will be lucky to win 10+ games in a season again while he's at A&amp;M. In my eyes, he clearly doesn't understand what he's up against when it comes to the truly great programs in the West.Manziel brought them their first taste of success in a long time, and that was only because it was so surprising how good he was that most defenses weren't prepared for him.&gt;Jeremy JohnsonI know. I was just reiterating.There was a closeup shot they did towards the end of that game that was just hilarious.Wait...why?Great, then we'll be handing out credit for 9-10 wins against an easy West division, just like last year with MissSt. Guess it's only a matter of time before they beat three "top 10" teams and find themselves at #1.Good luck with that. They've been going on all season.While he's not great, he had ZERO help from that OL FSU was fielding. Every time I watched him, it was like an absolute sieve.Gotta wonder how that's going to turn out against potentially much better front 7s in the CFP.Honestly, even though Hoke had trouble at UM, he's always been said to be very good with the players, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was able to get their support earlier than most might expect.&gt;Steve Elmer

Working out nicely.

&gt;William Gholston

Ahh yes, the 2012 game which ruined every announcer's pronunciation of Everett Golson's last name.Just found my extra large bottle of lube.Something tells me if Josh Adams somehow ended up starting all year, dude would have made Barkley and Gaskin look paltry, number-wise. That said, it would have been with a far superior OL.Finally some sense from an OSU fan. ^^^^^/sNot going to lie, I'm not exactly unhappy. We'll take all the help we can get, given the still-injured players who'll be out for the Fiesta.That's because everyone is a fucking hypocrite.I was actually impressed how great they looked, and their defense looked better than I expected in that game as well, regardless of your scoring being what it was.&gt;5* Tight End

*Fires up the Shamrock Phone*My god OP butchered both first AND last names, lol. I'm kind of impressed.Hey look at that.Muamiinb4 arguments start over whose Center may have been betterI can...understand that./discussionAlso:

Come on, people.So he's playing for Michigan State against Bama?Holy shit there's TWO of you. I KNEW it!Only if it spills over into the Cavs org and keeps LeBron from bringing a championship to Cleveland.Kinda do:

&gt;who initially came to Notre Dame as a defensive back before moving to wide receiver as a freshman&gt;the gates are always open

What sorcery is this?It's okay. I usually skim most of the time, too.Is it as bad in person as it is on TV?"Hey kid! You're not supposed to be here!"I just got curious as to how many stadiums one might be able to venture into on a road trip. I know there's a few that are always open, but I was hoping to learn what others were, too. :pThat's kind of hilarious.^^^It's ^^^what ^^^Fortune ^^^yells ^^^at ^^^Rudy ^^^when ^^^he ^^^walks ^^^on ^^^the ^^^field ^^^upon ^^^arrival ^^^at ^^^ND.I am not looking for updates on who a player follows on Twitter.You lose, :p
"It's gonna be a blowout" -People who haven't watched Temple play

GG Owls.

Also, Matakevich's strength/playing style reminded me of someone during the whole game and I couldn't remember who, but I do now...Clemson's Ben Boulware.Poor OSU with their consecutive 10+ win seasons.I thought I was about to get Michigan'd.Just like Jack Sparrow, Pirates are not predictable.It's okay we have an easy one next week...PITT.

/killmeI hate your team. :p40? That's a long life for an ND fan. At least I'm assuming...considering I think I have less than that because of my lifetime support of this team.If I don't drink during ND games, I'd be breaking shit...well....MORE shit.[How Wazzu makes me feel about ND's chances against Stanford](http://i.imgur.com/d3zlU8Y.jpg)Why.Ohhh Wazzu.I dunno, I think this is a lot of Stanford also just playing REALLY well now.OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH!

Love when players get the mic.That Wazzu WR just made Braxton's catch look like child's play.That fucking sucks for Wazzu. They deserved the win over Stanford.Who the fuck would take Sumlin that's BETTER than A&amp;M right now? Since the "surprise" that was JFF left, he hasn't proven he can beat truly good teams.I was about to say something, but then you included bad KeiVarae, so never mind. Good KeiVarae just does not make up for the Bad one.Well, it IS PITT.And LA money.&gt;  The SCAR game gave everyone False hope.

Literally what happened with A&amp;M last year, actually.Yeah but when's the last time George O'Leary had a direct effect on a terrible hire?The worst part is we have to relive this "no-catch" every time that one commercial comes on. I recognized it the first time I ever saw it.Yes. I've never seen an ND fan say he's a great human being.

edit: I should have worded this differently, not saying he's actually a bad personI'm pretty sure they get paid a ton of money to develop the football program and win games more so than...keeping their cool and managing an awkward situation between an assistant and a ref that might get you a huge penalty. Not saying it was right, but just let's be honest about the primary reason coaches are paid a lot of money.And now I know why Watson turned around there, I had no idea what precipitated that. That dude should have been removed from the field instantly. You don't hit opposing players like that.Dabo Swinney is Sarah Palin, confirmed.How much of the scoring problem isn't something that can be directly attributed to UGA's OC, though, and not Richt?&gt; They're a great program historically but a definitive step below Alabama, USC, Oklahoma, etc.

I'm just glad someone else said it....and didn't get crucified for it.So Richt becomes unemployed?[Let's ask Skip Bayless to weigh in here...Skip, who do you have?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6UwXBnCAAECq-z.png)This story was already covered earlier in the week on the sub...and there's no proof *as of right now* that any football players were involved...It's like the Top 3 were made just to mock Art Briles/Baylor.

I wish I did.Maybe. We'll see, since nobody else except for perhaps Clemson has looked particularly convincing. Honestly, I believe Baylor will be top 4, and probably not even 4th...but not first like some projections showed earlier on.Ehh, I wouldn't lump TCU in with them entirely, since they also had a Minnesota game earlier in the year and TCU already has played Texas, too.The contract is for like a decade or something, I can't remember (maybe it's only 2020?). I think they'll let it play out until then, as they should, to see how things develop.Yeah, I should have worded that perhaps a bit differently.This helps for ND's Temple game, I guess, too.That motherfucker can move those tree trunks faster than I think I've ever seen from a bigger guy.

Also, in the same vein as "names with the letter Z", Mizzell on UVA. Their recruiting of athletes has been great at UVA, it's just the coaching that seems to suffer.Well, most college students are just kids.Are you just creating single question posts today?Nice try, Art Briles.Okay, well stop.Because you didn't get into the playoff last year you damned scrub.4 me[Let's see the next game on ND's schedule is.....PITT.]

I think the opposite. This is a huge win for Notre Dame against a very good Temple team. | @ Pittsburgh

This, I'll take this explanation please.Yep, this is why IMO your overall SOS needs to make up for the lack of it, not just backloading.~~Nobody has completely shut out Texas this year.~~

wait....whoops. WTF. How did I miss this. ISU? Really?Looks like the switch actually DID get broken in the offseason position.No, you get downvoted BEFORE your opinion is even considered. Get it right.

edit: see?NO ANIMAL HAS AN ORANGE PAW PRINT, CLEMSON! DOWNVOTE.Until the loss of Russell actually proves to be a problem, you shouldn't be penalized. We'll see next week.
God damn, if this is True what a job market this will be during the offseason.&gt;Fuck I'm Beam'd he never got a NCI'm more worried about playing eternal thorn-in-the-side PITT next week.Could probably swap for UGA with the way they're playing right now.I'm still made about that opening week game. UNC just handed it to them on a silver platter.So your entire basis for thinking UNC isn't good is their week 1 game alone? At least that's what it sounds like you are saying.Clemson should be top 2, IMO.Everyone is talking about going into Stanford with 1-loss, and I'm still sitting here terrified of PITT...and BC and a little bit of Wake.*wanders over to TigerNet*Always.8th for ND? Good. My second flair is a little worried for the first, though.

Navy is 6-1 with their only loss to ND. They have @Memphis this next week, which I honestly believe they have a decent shot to win in potentially a close one. Can't wait for that game.That was quick.Everything is great for the Vols until the 4th quarter....dammit. :(I can't wait for Navy/Memphis. I think the Mids have a solid shot, too.True is basically a private version for further in depth discussion without a lot of the...added stuff....that you see in /r/CFB.Wow..this is...this is worse.Okay, Shirley.Nah, the real chaos would be Navy winning out, which would include beating Memphis this coming Saturday. Go America.[No, it's clear you're becoming a Baylor hater, too, given your rational thoughts. Come with me, it's okay I promise.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2204535-empire_vader_beckons_l.jpg)Seriously, how good do YOU think Temple is?

Also, what kind of a chance do you give Navy to beat Memphis this coming week? I think they have a decent chance, actually.He won't be benched. He's a liability in certain situations, BUT what he doesn't do he makes up for with helping everyone else around him, lining them up in the right positions, etc. Having a LB like him who knows the game that well behind a DT like Tillery to help adjust his positioning I think is crucial to getting those DTs in the right positions to make plays. While he's missed gap assignments and his fair share of tackles, consider what the defense looked like against ASU last year after Schmidt went down against Navy. It was lost. With one more year in the system, however, I think Morgan will be a MASSIVE improvement overall next year at ILB, combined with Martini/Onwualu at OLB, and also the slim chance that Jaylon returns for his senior year. Otherwise, Coney has looked good in the few times he's stepped in at OLB and has the instinct to be a very good contributor. I'm really hopeful that Asmar Bilal develops, because I think he could be a huge playmaker from everything I saw during his recruiting footage, etc.That one freshman should be a great target for Temple in the next couple year, great size as well and a solid catch radius.Yes. You need a "QB" on the defense. Before Collinsworth was out last year, he was actually the primary signal caller, so Schmidt was option 2 for that role. You need someone who studies the system, not just "knows it" just from being a part of it (aka # of years "in the system"). For example, a guy like Jaylon, he's not a signal caller, he's a guy you unleash and just let him do his thing, that's who Morgan's identity kind of aligns with. You need that "student of the system" in the play-calling/leadership role, and Schmidt is it on this defense. Next year, I'd say it's possible that Redfield takes that role, really smart dude and finally showing a better understanding of things as the season wears on.[Welcome.](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-31663-Will-Ferrell-The-Campaign-welc-1h2U.gif)Frankly, I think with that OL against Clemson's DL....Golson being mobile will be a big deal. He also does fairly well in those big games.They quite literally did.The balls on Cutler to run that in.As a team who actually beat USC, I see a problem with this. :pNothing is certain.If only PITT didn't lose. I already know they're going to come out like they're Bama or something.http://plus4chan.org/b/op/src/139528764249.pngThis is not the Bears defense I was looking for.Frankly, that could have been OPI if he wasn't careful.FUCK!

How fucking open do you have to be?! HOW?!Fuck everything about the ending of this game.lolhttp://i.imgur.com/gvHlJfN.gifHere comes the block.NFL is stupid. :(Well at least we can watch the Saints/Giants now.About the same chances ND gets the win over USC from 2005.2005 USC. I'm still in pain. Fuck that shittily-produced 30 for 30 and what they say. The rules were clear.Their backloading is going to be the death of their CFP hopes. People are just waiting to drop the B12 from the CFP given their top teams' SOS, and one late-season loss will take care of that.Plot twist: each gun is a six-shooter with only 2 bullets randomly placed.I love this GIF, not because I love seeing Uga sad, but because he's so damned cute.Coaches are also not supposed to just say "yeah, we're going to suck next year, too". What kind of leadership would that be if you didn't try to instill confidence in the team?I think Aggies are just looking for any way to bash Texas right now while they're down, since most of the posts are them struggling seem to come from your fans. Meanwhile, Sumlin hasn't beaten a good team since he had JFF.Holding a guy accountable for what....trying to display some outward confidence in his abilities and his players?Absolutely, IF that happens. It's high-risk, high-reward.Fuck. I like Norm as a guy, but I think it'll be interesing to see how things go with Hawaii now...if they continue football.You mean USC or SCar?


edit: to clarify, this dude has no flair, so I have no clue what fucking team he's referring to since some refer to South Carolina as USC, too.Some refer to South Carolina as USC, too, so I wasn't sure...especially since he's not flaired.No it wouldn't. :pIt's at the top of the subreddit. There's literally actually two posts about it already on the front of the sub.I agree. (not sarcasm)I have no idea what you're referring to, tbh. I'd need footage of it. Can you give about a time that it happened in the game, so I can check my recording?Wow, that would suck.Hey, I certainly hope not. I love those games. It's just that it was discussed around roughly a year ago, IIRC.Well that puts things into a bit more perspective. Damn, shitty ADs are bad for everyone. I'm really hopeful that things work out and get better for Hawaii soon.I'm ready for the tears. It's going to be amazing.Well...who do you have?Ohh, okay, I remember now. I don't see him ever looking at Luke, I think he was looking at the ref and yelling to him...and Luke just was standing there wondering what his concern was, like if the ref was going to be spoken to about a penalty on he or KVR or something. He literally doesn't seem to me to be concerned with Cole at all. That yell at the end doesn't even seem to me to be directed at Cole, either, even though it kinda looks like it.Solution: have less bowls.If it's on that atrocity of a field, I'm not watching it.The good thing about this is...it passes the time between seasons.I have some jazz knowledge, so I should apply to UNT.What kind of gig was it? Just out of curiosity.If you're deciding between environments, Clemson &gt; Bama. If it were at LSU, that would change my answer to LSU. This is just from all accounts from fans of those teams and also fans I know who have gone down to these places. I have yet to go sadly, but LSU and Clemson, in that order, are at the top of my list.&gt;Heisman front runner going up against arguably the best front 7 in the nation, I'd take it.

While I get the love for Fournette, in terms of matchups...Dalvin Cook vs Clemson's front 7 isn't all that far off, or Watson vs FSU's secondary. All I'm saying is that the other game provides what should be an almost equally awesome matchup.Yeah, I never meant to imply that's what it was....hoping it didn't come off that way.I would have started "the real Death Valley is LSU" debate myself. :p[Rocks are scary, bro.](https://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/galaxyquest.jpg)*twitch*No, OP has a clear raspberry bias.Don't forget ND/Temple. :D&gt; t-town is a shit hole full of coke head frat boys and the bars close the second they lose so take that into consideration 

Damn dude.

Wait...do they really close if Bama loses, like...just to avoid the crazy?&gt;I guess it's the reasonable thing to do because who really needs to keep drinking after drinking all day 

Not sure if really an LSU fan.Nice!

Let's hope that he sticks until then, 2017 is a long ways away, and he has almost all the big names on his list.

&gt;This decision was made earlier than some expected, but his grandmother lives in South Bend,

Ohh, so ND had a spy all along!Also, I love the fact that after the game he owned the mistakes and said the red zone mistakes he made were unacceptable. Hopefully he actually fixes it, though, too. Can't keep leaving those points off the board.I still can't wrap my head around the fact that OU lost to a team that just got shut out by ISU.So you already knew the answer to your own question?So you already knew the answer to your own question?

:pI'm beyond nervous to see what will happen between the three of them. I'm *almost* kind of glad they didn't pull Hunter Johnson now, given the years all of them have left. Also, the injury to Malik kind of showed each guy that any game could be their starting shot.Agreed.

FYI, it's Wimbush, with an "m". :p (might be autocorrect, now that I think about it)Yeah, mostly it's just the losers who never went there.

._.As if Duke is the first team to get screwed by a bad call. Next time, play better so they don't have a chance to pull this. If you let the refs decide, you've already potentially lost the game.Cook has a hamstring issue, but they rested him last game as well, so I think they're kind of holding him back until FSU.Tell them I apologize for being an embarrassment to the name/brand on the internet, unless they read this...then they already know.&gt;And... tradition


*checks Kyle Field*&gt; That guy is basically a JJ Watt

Wow, just wow.Ahh rivalries.2005 ND/USC. (IIRC after the game there was some admission that they fucked up)

I'm still waiting.LOL, sucks to be you.

[Checks ND 2016 schedule.](http://i.imgur.com/oRQTiMJ.gif)I hope Bo goes to Hawaii and makes them into at least a 9-4 team every year.ND has to play them there next year. I'm scared shitless, especially given ND's clear inability so far to play away games.&gt;Matt Mauk

lol, no "y"


Yeah, this was posted earlier today somewhere on here. edit: [Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3r40nj/mizzou_qb_maty_mauk_suspended_for_remainder_of/)Annd that's  the game...Mets have a SHOT if they limit them to this one run. Hooray for small rays of hope.

edit: uhhh, well nevermind.True. Ouch....literally and figuratively.[Like I said](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/3r5alf/game_thread_world_series_game_5_royals_31_mets_13/cwlaz4a), METS HAVE A SHOT IF THEY LIMIT THEM TO TWO RUNS!Hey at least we can all unite around the fact that the Yankees aren't in the World Series.This...sounds like Barkley talking to Ernie. Did I nail that?I've stayed up this late. Come on you fucking Metty bastards.

edit:  FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!Mets really Costanza'd the end of this game.This is perfect.This is what watching a Met die in nature looks like. Whatever a Met is.LOL stands are empty.&gt;Just don't go down without a fight, Mets.

You don't understand rivalries, do you? :pI hope they come back and win....and all the fans who left are like "......what?"WHO THE FUCK SWINGS AT THAT?!Of course it was Matt Damon.Good, now I can fire up Netflix before bed...finally.

Congrats both teams. Fuck the Yankees.I remember that USC line everyone was bitching about, too.Someone should tell Kansas students that the World Series is for Major League Baseball, not College Basketball.Damn, I had no idea about the extra BYE, as teams usually add the 13th game.Kinda-yes.

*ducks*6 teams is silly because it involves deciding who gets a BYE. It should be 8 and no more if you expand.How does having 8 teams increase the games even more (except for the team with the BYE)? If a team in the 6-team CFP that doesn't have a BYE goes all the way through...they play the same number of games as they would have in an 8-team CFP system.

That is...of course...only if my head is working this morning.So his brother is a seamstress. Got it.I'm guessing the comment graveyard had something to do with the election part.It's morning.Too.Cincinnati fans, where are you?Maybe Texas is already down, so you can't really categorize the loss to ISU as something truly "worse" than much else that has gone on this year.Just use news.google.com, search "college football" (add the week/team/conference if you like), and ignore anything from BleacherReport...so you'll have to scroll about halfway down.This sounds like something Rocket Ismail would have done....but not defense now that I think of it.Too soon to tell.That...title alone annoys me.

&gt;Illinois went for it on fourth down and didn't know itThis saddens the Cutcliffe. Someone should send him a shirt.So this is how we add the next job opening, Cutcliffe just hangs it up after it happens to his team twice.That background behind the player is absolutely atrocious. Makes it almost impossible to tell where the uniform ends.*Could you pass me that bowl of sour grapes, please?*This...this speaks to me.&gt; We have only ever had 3 coaches with losing records and one of those was Fickell who never lost the interim title. A third of our head coaches have made the College Football Hall of Fame.

&gt;If you coach at Ohio State you are more likely to get into the Hall of Fame than having a losing record.

None of these specific points signifies being the top job in CFB. The money and recruiting points are the only two that would be direct benefits of the job, and I frankly I think at least Texas and USC can outbid OSU if they wanted to any day of the week.No it's not. I love the fact that this huge game doesn't have some cutesy name to it.

If I had to choose something, I'd go with something like "Battle of the Gulf" or something ridiculous like that, given the Gulf of Mexico being right there. It's a stupid name, I know.I love Tony Alford's little anecdote about Dexter Williams' first visit.There you go. I'm sure the veterans would love it, too...[WE USED TO BE **HUGE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaQUSVOupE)What...it's nice...especially nicer than it used to be...but I can't possibly think that Hyde Park is nicer than Evanston.Win out, beating Stanford.

Some CCG winner that's not B12 has to have 2-losses.

Baylor and TCU (and/or whoever else is at the top of the B12) probably both need a loss, but it's *possible* that ND's resume at 11-1 is seen as better than theirs at 12-0 at season's end.Hah, that's True.That's...the perfect way to describe the differences.When Dex visited, he was telling him they'd have coats and everything waiting for him....also it was Dexter's first time seeing snow...and he loved it.

[I think it's in this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBc2LsGwSs8)This is exactly what I've been saying about Richt. Who? Who the hell can UGA pull that will give them BETTER overall success than he has right now? (and USC might be looking at the same guy..and can outbid UGA easily) One bad season...and he's coming off a 10-3 year while being 5-3 right now. Regardless of the scoring struggles, you don't just go and fire a dude with his track record/longevity in the program. No offense, but UGA is not Alabama, they're not USC, they're not Texas...and yet these fans calling for Richt seem to think they are (yes, I get that UGA is the flagship in a great recruiting state, but there's more to it than that).

I just really don't want to see a program I have kind of a soft spot for make a silly decision and then end up with a Willingham/Weis situation...a situation a non-blue blood may have a really rough time recovering from if they managed to pull the trigger on the wrong guy. Also bear in mind that a season like 2013 was in large part because of injuries. If anything, I think they should really explore coordinator/other staff changes first, not HC changes.

If Mark Richt can't go 10-4, 12-2, 8-5, 10-3 and keep his job, then who the hell in their right mind would take that position?Doing everything they can to ensure he stays and doesn't look at any other jobs?Will Fuller can outrun him, too, just like Adoree.

*runs* ^^but ^^not ^^fast ^^enough ^^to ^^get ^^away

All kidding aside, though, USC is going to be one of the fastest teams in CFB on the field if they keep pulling these types of guys in. That alone is scary.Older one, but i love it.He didn't run right through him, so much as make a small juke to the inside and faked him out. I still think Nicky shouldn't have gotten beat on that move, though. Then again, as Greek said, that IS a bit of a tough position to come in right off the bench...Nope, just halfway through the second game...and starting RB on like his third carry in the first game.I'm hopeful for TTU that Kolin Hill can come in next year and have a big impact...if your DC sets him up for success, he could be a great addition.&gt;At this point the only thing BC can hope for is to ruin Notre Dame's season, always a worthy goal.

Oh I hate you BC, because this is ALWAYS possible. :pJoe Montana.

He's Joe Montana.Gonna be interesting to see how ND handles replacing Grant and Connaughton, though. Huge losses.Fuck, that sucks.

Probably from tossing too many Utes to the side.In a similar vein, anyone know who else of the 1-loss teams only has their loss to an undefeated team? (didn't think creating a whole new thread for this question alone was a good idea)

edit: UF's loss is to LSU, so that's one. MAYBE the only one, come to think of it.*twitch*

:'(Jon Gruden*I* am your father.[Search your feelings, you know it to be True. Join me.](http://i.imgur.com/pvorT.gif)In no particular order:

Notre Dame vs USC

Michigan vs Ohio State

Alabama vs Auburn

Texas vs Oklahoma

Army vs Navy

Offseason vs SeasonND/USC compares to those easily. Outside of recent events, the Iron Bowl was simply NOT on the national radar like OSU/UM, ND/USC, Texas/OU, etc. have been for quite a while.

edit: Obviously, this will be met with exception, most likely from fans who are too young to remember what CFB was like over a decade ago. That said, the Iron Bowl is absolutely huge now.Prepping for a potential upset, I see.http://i.imgur.com/ORETsvC.gifLSU is simply the worst place to play if you are an opposing team.Any human being at USC should be able to out-recruit UCLA. To some extent, USC sells itself and UCLA does not. (in football)Words I never thought I'd say a few years ago:

I'm really fucking pumped for that Temple/Memphis game.You?Clemson (specifically TheClemsonInsider and TigerNet) likes to take things a bit out of context to get their fans all riled up, apparently. They did the exact same thing for some of the pre-ND game comments from some of ND's players.Zero respect for Michigan. Zero. Fun. Sir.Yeah, his awkwardness was perfect.Yeah, his success jump actually directly correlates with the hire of Chad Morris in 2011, which is why some I think were concerned how things would progress with him taking the job at SMU. And then Venables was added in 2012, which is where the Clemson defense really started to become what it is now.It's "fun" to read the forums sometimes, though.Yeah, that's why I put "who else"...perhaps I didn't make that clear.Injuries. Motherfucker.~~I'm getting real tired of your shit, FireRicht Crowd/Internet.~~

I get it now. Went through the questions... I picked Steve Spurrier. Interesting...I was missing the question thing....Noscript blocked it. I was...confused.

:(

So, you predict Iowa will be a top 7-8 team...and then rant against your own prediction?

And who the hell spells out someone's record, like "6 and 2"? ;p

&gt;would you argue music with Eddie Van Halen?

As an avid jazz listener (to a snobbish degree), yes.

&gt;Would you argue food with Wolfgang Puck?

His canned soups aren't that great.

&gt;Would you argue Film making with Martin Scorsese?

Maybe.

&gt;Iowa knows Osborne and Alvarez, the two key people in the committee.

Bro, you know multiple schools have connections to individuals on the committee, right? Like ND and Stanford both have a connection with Condi? And, ironically, Ty coached at both schools.

edit: every school, changed to "multiple schools" as that wasn't the correct way to word that.That's awesome.Yes.

I believe this is where the phrase "wake up sheeple!" comes in.Britney Spears also made millions. Doesn't mean her music is that great, or more importantly especially complex/requiring a boatload of knowledge/talent. It's pop, it's designed to appeal to the masses, just like a lot of rock/heavy metal music is extremely basic at its core.

It's actually scientifically known that most recent music has been *designed* to be less cerebral, and hard rock/metal like Van Halen also applies.

Not saying he's not great (as I do like some of his stuff), but there's a lot more going on in a Wes Montgomery solo than there is an Eddie Van Halen solo.Let's be fair, in True GRRM fashion...everyone should fear for their lives, not just visiting players.So was Utah...

Actually Utah is like the Ron Paul, HUGE at one point but basically irrelevant on Reddit in favor of the new guy (Bernie, Clemson)I like how Alabama's loss is to a now-20th ranked Ole Miss team and yet they get the benefit of the doubt of the 1-loss teams.

Then again, I kind of understand it.Something tells me this spelling was autocorrected. It's perfect.
B12, not SEC.

What you need to know is Aggies will be even more excited if Kansas pulls the upset.Is this a job application? Because I'd totally be down with coaching in Hawaii.Ahh yes...

"The Pete Carroll"Should have said "it makes you want to do the right thing each and every day, like beating Bama."Nice try, puntageddon.I can't tell you how much I love this intro, every damned time."Here IS ten reasons why"

AND IF HE SHOULD WANDER HE SHALL NOT FALL, AND IF HE SHOULD FALL, HE WILL FALL IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO COVER UP HIS RANK SO THAT PASSERSBY WILL THINK HE IS A SOBER WANDERER!

AHHHHH!Oh, I see it now.Tiger God wants a rematch, too.

*swiggity swooty*He did that thing after the kick return in he MCB. So there's that.Frankly, I'm a big fan of [Kizer flapping his owl wings at Temple players](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWjFXXywnY8NSW6US1qs0jPoJFw=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4217761/flap.0.gif)

The context for this is that a Temple player was ripping at the ball halfway or more into the endzone, lol, so Kizer turned to him and did this.

[Vine of it](https://vine.co/v/e3JeIg2UF2a)looolWow, that's hilarious that someone actually made this.Damn......TIL.Bye week is literally the black knight.The crowd goes wild.I'm going to need a truckload of popcorn.&gt; Yeah it kinda sucked that every time Notre Dame's offense was out it was all rainy and windy and wet and then when Clemson's offense took the field everything magically dried up and became perfect playing conditions

At least you're finally acknowledging the weather bias.We did this like....a couple days ago.Time to check ASU's football inflation practices.That is True. Fair enough.Notre Dame. As long as the dude wasn't all threatening and stuff, ND is very accepting of those with other beliefs, IMO. Te'o was Mormon, for example.Parents always find a way to make things awkward for their kids.Hah, I was at that MSU/ND game. To this day, I still remember an ND fan from the top screaming down "Get Smoker!" almost all game. It was hilarious and annoying at the same time.Yes, has been posted from numerous outlets.

&gt;and the report indicates a player on the world famous Notre Dame football team was also involved in the sex scandal.

From this line alone, we can see the True colors of "The Daily Caller" website (whoever the fuck that is). The "world famous" part is just oozing with sarcasm/attitude.No.If the candidate showed strong morals and a good attitude that aligned with the school's mission, yes I totally believe they'd be accepted. Some may seem to think that just because ND is a religious institution that it means they're in line with your average backwater Southern Baptist crazies, when that couldn't be further from the truth IMO.Just like Baylor, until it proves to cost them a game...I don't think either team should be penalized for having a different QB.So what you're saying is that Clemson is due for some trouble?I mean, everyone was also talking about Miami simply because of Al Golden's presence and waiting for him to be fired.So he's transferring to Notre Dame next year. Got it.

Oh look, a backfield with Fournette, Prosise, and Folston.I'll watch both. When ND is on, all other games are off. But with MSU/Vols, I can stand to watch those simultaneously with others.&gt;Things get weird in the ACC. 

[The ACC in one GIF](http://i.imgur.com/GtxQvoH.gif)Well MSU IS the premiere program in the State of Michigan now.Anyone have a link to the current complete list?

Also consider that this has to be a coach that USC (Southern Cal, not South Carolina) isn't interested in, because UGA flat out can't compete with them.I wouldn't say "nothing alike". I'd say UGA and Nebraska are both more similar that you're giving them credit for. Monetarily, I think Nebraska could pay about that much ($4M), too, if they had the right candidate they were really sold on. Bo Pelini was right above 3 million, IIRC, before his firing.

They both have a solid history and a vocal fanbase, on top of this, they are both top programs that are just below the truly "premiere program" line like you see in USC, Texas, etc. And while Nebraska doesn't "live in" a solid recruiting state, their name carries a lot of weight nationally (more so than UGA, IMO), in part thanks to their 90s/2000s success, so I believe their recruiting level could  easily rival that of UGA's over a relatively short period of time with the right staff.Okay. Solid response. The phrase "threatening and stuff" was not the best choice of words, I'll give you that. But from everything I know about the school, past and present, it wouldn't be some massive problem.[More Richt posts.](http://media.giphy.com/media/46itMIe0bkQeY/giphy.gif)Dammit who put that on the teleprompter!I think UGA will win one more at least before they meet GT.

Kentucky, Auburn, and GaSo could all even be wins...but I'd be surprised if they don't win at LEAST one of them.That would certainly be something.Little hostile, aren't we?&gt;It was all "ND is deeper, by keeping deshaun limited in the passing game ND's superior talent all around will win out." 


&gt;superior talent all around

I don't think anybody realistic said ND had outright superior talent "all around", at least when it came to the starters, if anything that was probably some TCI or TigerNet garbage being flung about. Or you're just creating that narrative yourself to play the victim. Most often that I saw, it was said to be strength vs strength, ND's OL vs Clemson's DL. Clemson's DL played a hell of a game and won the run defense battle. But, on the pass plays, if you watch the game again, ND's pocket protection was still pretty damned solid.

&gt;depth

The depth thing is somewhat True. I can't think of any Clemson fan that doesn't acknowledge that their depth is somewhat thin right now, although over the course of the season it's been getting better with the experience they're getting. Unfortunately, ND's depth is also being tested due to all their injuries, one of which occurred early on in the Clemson game to ND's LG Quenton Nelson, and another of which occurred the week prior to ND's best blocker at TE Luatua. Those two were key losses that contributed to ND's inability to run block for Prosise against an extremely talented Clemson DL.

&gt;People want to twist the narrative any way they can to discredit that win. 

Just like Clemson fans want to say they took their foot off the gas, while not lending ANY credit to the possibility that ND made adjustments and played terribly early on. If only there were other games that displayed similar behaviors from this ND team....oh wait, there are. They've been somewhat streaky against every opponent they've played since Texas. Nobody has gotten a full 4 quarters from this ND team since then. That, of course, would require watching this team play and keying in on certain aspects of the way they play defense quarter-to-quarter, especially.

Either way, Clemson played their tails off and won the game.In the "No" column.I swear to god I'll pistol whip the next person that posts a Fire Mark Richt story.Can ND get their injured players back now, too? :([PUT THOSE AWAY!](http://i.imgur.com/v2USOjw.jpg)How To Stop 2014 Golson 101/r/firemarkrichtSo that makes TWO coaches the players support that USC won't hire.This isn't about /r/cfb, this is about firing Mark Richt...the most important thing since firing Al Golden.Nice try, Iowa fan.AHHHHHHH.....Well, if ND had a week between UMass and Clemson, Luatua would have been back, which would have helped immensely for the run game. So maybe not just prep, but injury recovery as well, which would have been huge.Ole Miss wasn't throwing buckets of money at their program when he was there like they are now. I think in the right environment, a coach that has that kind of player support can flourish and gets the best out of them.I did, and it makes some very solid points. I was just making a joke for karma.Most pro-Clemson posts are made my Clemson fans.

Most pro-Alabama posts are made by Alabama fans.

Most pro-USC posts are made by USC fans.

Most pro-Texas posts are not made by A&amp;M fans, I can assure you of that.

There's some kind of pattern here.Just woke up from a nap.

[Hey guys, what's going on?](http://i.imgur.com/biDFHU0.gif)This guy gets it.Cheerio good chap!In True PITT fashion, they could fuck everything up.I'm always rooting for LSU between the two of them.[Fly away, little owl.](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWjFXXywnY8NSW6US1qs0jPoJFw=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4217761/flap.0.gif)&gt;A la Michigan State winning on a miracle compared to ND losing by only two to Clemson. Compare them both and ND's is more impressive as a body of work.

Careful, this is how you attract the "BUT VIRGINIA!" crowd.Same. I mean...we're a little biased, though.Hey look, something we can agree on! (also especially your Vols flair...which I hadn't noticed until recently)


^^^^^:DIt's the 2nd one, and that happens when we meet in the playoff for a rematch. :DIf you can't get past FSU, I will be mad. Although, I can't say I don't still have a soft spot for Golson.Right here.Because they do.

Also, because you're Bama's rival.*rains on your parade*I mean...let's be honest....we're saying this because they played such a close game with ND.Oh good.Good. Fuck'em.Nice try, Redditor.I mean...that's kinda scary for the kids. Someone should be actively researching this and then hopefully working on reducing/eliminating this possibility.I'm starting to realize that I'm *really* old around here. This explains the bitterness.If I say it now, they won't. That's how this works, right?Zero. Conference. Wins.

What BS.Shh, still have to play PITT.There really is only one approach to these threads if you're a Bama fan.

I'm waiting for the "Notre Dame at #5" thread.Offseason, WHY. CAN'T. YOU. JUST. DIE!?!!?!!?

This is literally impossible.This is why I'm not a fan of the subreddit growth. It's clear that most (not all) of the additional subs are been low-quality posters at best.YOU GO TO HELL, PITT!edit: I think I misunderstood the question...maybe?


I'd say

Clemson wins out

Bama wins out

ND wins out

OSU wins out

Baylor wins out, but still gets bumped out just because their SOS is worse than ND's who would slide in at #4 after a big win @Stanford.This title also forgot "Strength of schedule".This might be the stupidest thing I've ever read. They said themselves in the CFP criteria outline at one point that MARGIN (of win only, I believe) does NOT matter, so putting up absurd nunbers of points aginst the Lamars and Kansas(es) of the world shouldn't matter.It's later in the night, so it'll only be 50% sodium.So we ignore the other 9 teams on the schedule. Got it. That seems to be what you're saying anyway.I will say I agree with this entirely.I'm feeling okay right now. And everyone is bitching about Bama at #4 to pull all the attention away.Who let TigerNet out of its cage?! :pAgreed, same would also apply for Baylor and TCU as well if they were #1. Over time, though, these things change.16th Notre Dame, below Ole Miss with 2 losses, Alabama with 1...to Ole Miss...let's see below....UTAH?! A team who got killed by USC literally the week after ND beat the Trojans?I'm having trouble with Utah over ND, given the USC result.Posted earlier...somewhere.

edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3rdqam/you_dont_know_dabo/Ahh, I can't read.Fair enough.I don't care who it is. I just want to see Hawaii good again. Late games would be awesome, if the crowds started showing up again especially.Hey, App is 7-1 right now and their facilities had gotten a solid upgrade recently.*waits for OP's SCar or FSU flair*And it's also not like NCSU isn't a good team.Clemson's "incredibly weak schedule"? That's...an exaggeration.I'm not even talking about ND. Take ND out of it...you still have a 7-1 AppState, now 5-3 NCSU, now 4-4 Louisville, and 5-3 Miami. It's really NOT the worst slate so far if you actually know what you're talking about.That doesn't change that the phrase "incredibly weak schedule" is a gross exaggeration, which was my point. Now, start comparing them to all the other undefeateds, who has played a MUCH better schedule than Clemson so far, since theirs is "incredibly weak"?You're still avoiding naming undefeated teams that have played schedules so far that are heads and shoulders above Clemson's allegedly "incredibly weak schedule" (your words) to date, which was part of the premise of your initial post. So...any time you want to do that, let me know.

&gt;ND will not.

ND just played and beat a top 25 and undefeated Temple team. Pitt is a 6-2 team. Stanford has a very solid shot to come into the ND game at 10-1. Wake and BC don't necessarily help matters.Baylor plays tougher teams than Ohio State.

Hah! Take that!ND not even in the top 10. Vegas is a silly place anyway. :p (biased)

Also, bear in mind Vegas bases a LOT of their stuff off of stats/number-crunching and not watching the games/teams in question.You're not helping the BashClemsonFest!

Hey, where'd you pull these from?Notre Dame, Notre Dame would be ahead of you. :pNO, FUCK YOU, MAD NOW! WE SHOULD BE #1 ALL THE TIME!

2007 NOTRE DAME WAS THE BEST TEAM IN THE COUNTRY AND NOBODY KNEW IT!ND could end up with a rematch with both LSU and Clemson.

That is both exciting and terrifying. Mostly terrifying.Last time we used that...things didn't turn out so well.You lose, :p
"It's gonna be a blowout" -People who haven't watched Temple play

GG Owls.

Also, Matakevich's strength/playing style reminded me of someone during the whole game and I couldn't remember who, but I do now...Clemson's Ben Boulware.Poor OSU with their consecutive 10+ win seasons.I thought I was about to get Michigan'd.Just like Jack Sparrow, Pirates are not predictable.It's okay we have an easy one next week...PITT.

/killmeI hate your team. :p40? That's a long life for an ND fan. At least I'm assuming...considering I think I have less than that because of my lifetime support of this team.If I don't drink during ND games, I'd be breaking shit...well....MORE shit.[How Wazzu makes me feel about ND's chances against Stanford](http://i.imgur.com/d3zlU8Y.jpg)Why.Ohhh Wazzu.I dunno, I think this is a lot of Stanford also just playing REALLY well now.OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH!

Love when players get the mic.That Wazzu WR just made Braxton's catch look like child's play.That fucking sucks for Wazzu. They deserved the win over Stanford.Who the fuck would take Sumlin that's BETTER than A&amp;M right now? Since the "surprise" that was JFF left, he hasn't proven he can beat truly good teams.I was about to say something, but then you included bad KeiVarae, so never mind. Good KeiVarae just does not make up for the Bad one.Well, it IS PITT.And LA money.&gt;  The SCAR game gave everyone False hope.

Literally what happened with A&amp;M last year, actually.Yeah but when's the last time George O'Leary had a direct effect on a terrible hire?The worst part is we have to relive this "no-catch" every time that one commercial comes on. I recognized it the first time I ever saw it.Yes. I've never seen an ND fan say he's a great human being.

edit: I should have worded this differently, not saying he's actually a bad personI'm pretty sure they get paid a ton of money to develop the football program and win games more so than...keeping their cool and managing an awkward situation between an assistant and a ref that might get you a huge penalty. Not saying it was right, but just let's be honest about the primary reason coaches are paid a lot of money.And now I know why Watson turned around there, I had no idea what precipitated that. That dude should have been removed from the field instantly. You don't hit opposing players like that.Dabo Swinney is Sarah Palin, confirmed.How much of the scoring problem isn't something that can be directly attributed to UGA's OC, though, and not Richt?&gt; They're a great program historically but a definitive step below Alabama, USC, Oklahoma, etc.

I'm just glad someone else said it....and didn't get crucified for it.So Richt becomes unemployed?[Let's ask Skip Bayless to weigh in here...Skip, who do you have?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6UwXBnCAAECq-z.png)This story was already covered earlier in the week on the sub...and there's no proof *as of right now* that any football players were involved...It's like the Top 3 were made just to mock Art Briles/Baylor.

I wish I did.Maybe. We'll see, since nobody else except for perhaps Clemson has looked particularly convincing. Honestly, I believe Baylor will be top 4, and probably not even 4th...but not first like some projections showed earlier on.Ehh, I wouldn't lump TCU in with them entirely, since they also had a Minnesota game earlier in the year and TCU already has played Texas, too.The contract is for like a decade or something, I can't remember (maybe it's only 2020?). I think they'll let it play out until then, as they should, to see how things develop.Yeah, I should have worded that perhaps a bit differently.This helps for ND's Temple game, I guess, too.That motherfucker can move those tree trunks faster than I think I've ever seen from a bigger guy.

Also, in the same vein as "names with the letter Z", Mizzell on UVA. Their recruiting of athletes has been great at UVA, it's just the coaching that seems to suffer.Well, most college students are just kids.Are you just creating single question posts today?Nice try, Art Briles.Okay, well stop.Because you didn't get into the playoff last year you damned scrub.4 me[Let's see the next game on ND's schedule is.....PITT.]

UNC just handed it to them on a silver platter.So your entire basis for thinking UNC isn't good is their week 1 game alone? At least that's what it sounds like you are saying.Clemson should be top 2, IMO.Everyone is talking about going into Stanford with 1-loss, and I'm still sitting here terrified of PITT...and BC and a little bit of Wake.*wanders over to TigerNet*Always.8th for ND? Good. My second flair is a little worried for the first, though.

Navy is 6-1 with their only loss to ND. They have @Memphis this next week, which I honestly believe they have a decent shot to win in potentially a close one. Can't wait for that game.That was quick.Everything is great for the Vols until the 4th quarter....dammit. :(I can't wait for Navy/Memphis. I think the Mids have a solid shot, too.True is basically a private version for further in depth discussion without a lot of the...added stuff....that you see in /r/CFB.Wow..this is...this is worse.Okay, Shirley.Nah, the real chaos would be Navy winning out, which would include beating Memphis this coming Saturday. Go America.[No, it's clear you're becoming a Baylor hater, too, given your rational thoughts. Come with me, it's okay I promise.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2204535-empire_vader_beckons_l.jpg)Seriously, how good do YOU think Temple is?

Also, what kind of a chance do you give Navy to beat Memphis this coming week? I think they have a decent chance, actually.He won't be benched. He's a liability in certain situations, BUT what he doesn't do he makes up for with helping everyone else around him, lining them up in the right positions, etc. Having a LB like him who knows the game that well behind a DT like Tillery to help adjust his positioning I think is crucial to getting those DTs in the right positions to make plays. While he's missed gap assignments and his fair share of tackles, consider what the defense looked like against ASU last year after Schmidt went down against Navy. It was lost. With one more year in the system, however, I think Morgan will be a MASSIVE improvement overall next year at ILB, combined with Martini/Onwualu at OLB, and also the slim chance that Jaylon returns for his senior year. Otherwise, Coney has looked good in the few times he's stepped in at OLB and has the instinct to be a very good contributor. I'm really hopeful that Asmar Bilal develops, because I think he could be a huge playmaker from everything I saw during his recruiting footage, etc.That one freshman should be a great target for Temple in the next couple year, great size as well and a solid catch radius.Yes. You need a "QB" on the defense. Before Collinsworth was out last year, he was actually the primary signal caller, so Schmidt was option 2 for that role. You need someone who studies the system, not just "knows it" just from being a part of it (aka # of years "in the system"). For example, a guy like Jaylon, he's not a signal caller, he's a guy you unleash and just let him do his thing, that's who Morgan's identity kind of aligns with. You need that "student of the system" in the play-calling/leadership role, and Schmidt is it on this defense. Next year, I'd say it's possible that Redfield takes that role, really smart dude and finally showing a better understanding of things as the season wears on.[Welcome.](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-31663-Will-Ferrell-The-Campaign-welc-1h2U.gif)Frankly, I think with that OL against Clemson's DL....Golson being mobile will be a big deal. He also does fairly well in those big games.They quite literally did.The balls on Cutler to run that in.As a team who actually beat USC, I see a problem with this. :pNothing is certain.If only PITT didn't lose. I already know they're going to come out like they're Bama or something.http://plus4chan.org/b/op/src/139528764249.pngThis is not the Bears defense I was looking for.Frankly, that could have been OPI if he wasn't careful.FUCK!

How fucking open do you have to be?! HOW?!Fuck everything about the ending of this game.lolhttp://i.imgur.com/gvHlJfN.gifHere comes the block.NFL is stupid. :(Well at least we can watch the Saints/Giants now.About the same chances ND gets the win over USC from 2005.2005 USC. I'm still in pain. Fuck that shittily-produced 30 for 30 and what they say. The rules were clear.Their backloading is going to be the death of their CFP hopes. People are just waiting to drop the B12 from the CFP given their top teams' SOS, and one late-season loss will take care of that.Plot twist: each gun is a six-shooter with only 2 bullets randomly placed.I love this GIF, not because I love seeing Uga sad, but because he's so damned cute.Coaches are also not supposed to just say "yeah, we're going to suck next year, too". What kind of leadership would that be if you didn't try to instill confidence in the team?I think Aggies are just looking for any way to bash Texas right now while they're down, since most of the posts are them struggling seem to come from your fans. Meanwhile, Sumlin hasn't beaten a good team since he had JFF.Holding a guy accountable for what....trying to display some outward confidence in his abilities and his players?Absolutely, IF that happens. It's high-risk, high-reward.Fuck. I like Norm as a guy, but I think it'll be interesing to see how things go with Hawaii now...if they continue football.You mean USC or SCar?


edit: to clarify, this dude has no flair, so I have no clue what fucking team he's referring to since some refer to South Carolina as USC, too.Some refer to South Carolina as USC, too, so I wasn't sure...especially since he's not flaired.No it wouldn't. :pIt's at the top of the subreddit. There's literally actually two posts about it already on the front of the sub.I agree. (not sarcasm)I have no idea what you're referring to, tbh. I'd need footage of it. Can you give about a time that it happened in the game, so I can check my recording?Wow, that would suck.Hey, I certainly hope not. I love those games. It's just that it was discussed around roughly a year ago, IIRC.Well that puts things into a bit more perspective. Damn, shitty ADs are bad for everyone. I'm really hopeful that things work out and get better for Hawaii soon.I'm ready for the tears. It's going to be amazing.Well...who do you have?Ohh, okay, I remember now. I don't see him ever looking at Luke, I think he was looking at the ref and yelling to him...and Luke just was standing there wondering what his concern was, like if the ref was going to be spoken to about a penalty on he or KVR or something. He literally doesn't seem to me to be concerned with Cole at all. That yell at the end doesn't even seem to me to be directed at Cole, either, even though it kinda looks like it.Solution: have less bowls.If it's on that atrocity of a field, I'm not watching it.The good thing about this is...it passes the time between seasons.I have some jazz knowledge, so I should apply to UNT.What kind of gig was it? Just out of curiosity.If you're deciding between environments, Clemson &gt; Bama. If it were at LSU, that would change my answer to LSU. This is just from all accounts from fans of those teams and also fans I know who have gone down to these places. I have yet to go sadly, but LSU and Clemson, in that order, are at the top of my list.&gt;Heisman front runner going up against arguably the best front 7 in the nation, I'd take it.

While I get the love for Fournette, in terms of matchups...Dalvin Cook vs Clemson's front 7 isn't all that far off, or Watson vs FSU's secondary. All I'm saying is that the other game provides what should be an almost equally awesome matchup.Yeah, I never meant to imply that's what it was....hoping it didn't come off that way.I would have started "the real Death Valley is LSU" debate myself. :p[Rocks are scary, bro.](https://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/galaxyquest.jpg)*twitch*No, OP has a clear raspberry bias.Don't forget ND/Temple. :D&gt; t-town is a shit hole full of coke head frat boys and the bars close the second they lose so take that into consideration 

Damn dude.

Wait...do they really close if Bama loses, like...just to avoid the crazy?&gt;I guess it's the reasonable thing to do because who really needs to keep drinking after drinking all day 

Not sure if really an LSU fan.Nice!

Let's hope that he sticks until then, 2017 is a long ways away, and he has almost all the big names on his list.

&gt;This decision was made earlier than some expected, but his grandmother lives in South Bend,

Ohh, so ND had a spy all along!Also, I love the fact that after the game he owned the mistakes and said the red zone mistakes he made were unacceptable. Hopefully he actually fixes it, though, too. Can't keep leaving those points off the board.I still can't wrap my head around the fact that OU lost to a team that just got shut out by ISU.So you already knew the answer to your own question?So you already knew the answer to your own question?

:pI'm beyond nervous to see what will happen between the three of them. I'm *almost* kind of glad they didn't pull Hunter Johnson now, given the years all of them have left. Also, the injury to Malik kind of showed each guy that any game could be their starting shot.Agreed.

FYI, it's Wimbush, with an "m". :p (might be autocorrect, now that I think about it)Yeah, mostly it's just the losers who never went there.

._.As if Duke is the first team to get screwed by a bad call. Next time, play better so they don't have a chance to pull this. If you let the refs decide, you've already potentially lost the game.Cook has a hamstring issue, but they rested him last game as well, so I think they're kind of holding him back until FSU.Tell them I apologize for being an embarrassment to the name/brand on the internet, unless they read this...then they already know.&gt;And... tradition


*checks Kyle Field*&gt; That guy is basically a JJ Watt

Wow, just wow.Ahh rivalries.2005 ND/USC. (IIRC after the game there was some admission that they fucked up)

I'm still waiting.LOL, sucks to be you.

[Checks ND 2016 schedule.](http://i.imgur.com/oRQTiMJ.gif)I hope Bo goes to Hawaii and makes them into at least a 9-4 team every year.ND has to play them there next year. I'm scared shitless, especially given ND's clear inability so far to play away games.&gt;Matt Mauk

lol, no "y"


Yeah, this was posted earlier today somewhere on here. edit: [Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3r40nj/mizzou_qb_maty_mauk_suspended_for_remainder_of/)Annd that's  the game...Mets have a SHOT if they limit them to this one run. Hooray for small rays of hope.

edit: uhhh, well nevermind.True. Ouch....literally and figuratively.[Like I said](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/3r5alf/game_thread_world_series_game_5_royals_31_mets_13/cwlaz4a), METS HAVE A SHOT IF THEY LIMIT THEM TO TWO RUNS!Hey at least we can all unite around the fact that the Yankees aren't in the World Series.This...sounds like Barkley talking to Ernie. Did I nail that?I've stayed up this late. Come on you fucking Metty bastards.

edit:  FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!Mets really Costanza'd the end of this game.This is perfect.This is what watching a Met die in nature looks like. Whatever a Met is.LOL stands are empty.&gt;Just don't go down without a fight, Mets.

You don't understand rivalries, do you? :pI hope they come back and win....and all the fans who left are like "......what?"WHO THE FUCK SWINGS AT THAT?!Of course it was Matt Damon.Good, now I can fire up Netflix before bed...finally.

Congrats both teams. Fuck the Yankees.I remember that USC line everyone was bitching about, too.Someone should tell Kansas students that the World Series is for Major League Baseball, not College Basketball.Damn, I had no idea about the extra BYE, as teams usually add the 13th game.Kinda-yes.

*ducks*6 teams is silly because it involves deciding who gets a BYE. It should be 8 and no more if you expand.How does having 8 teams increase the games even more (except for the team with the BYE)? If a team in the 6-team CFP that doesn't have a BYE goes all the way through...they play the same number of games as they would have in an 8-team CFP system.

That is...of course...only if my head is working this morning.So his brother is a seamstress. Got it.I'm guessing the comment graveyard had something to do with the election part.It's morning.Too.Cincinnati fans, where are you?Maybe Texas is already down, so you can't really categorize the loss to ISU as something truly "worse" than much else that has gone on this year.Just use news.google.com, search "college football" (add the week/team/conference if you like), and ignore anything from BleacherReport...so you'll have to scroll about halfway down.This sounds like something Rocket Ismail would have done....but not defense now that I think of it.Too soon to tell.That...title alone annoys me.

&gt;Illinois went for it on fourth down and didn't know itThis saddens the Cutcliffe. Someone should send him a shirt.So this is how we add the next job opening, Cutcliffe just hangs it up after it happens to his team twice.That background behind the player is absolutely atrocious. Makes it almost impossible to tell where the uniform ends.*Could you pass me that bowl of sour grapes, please?*This...this speaks to me.&gt; We have only ever had 3 coaches with losing records and one of those was Fickell who never lost the interim title. A third of our head coaches have made the College Football Hall of Fame.

&gt;If you coach at Ohio State you are more likely to get into the Hall of Fame than having a losing record.

None of these specific points signifies being the top job in CFB. The money and recruiting points are the only two that would be direct benefits of the job, and I frankly I think at least Texas and USC can outbid OSU if they wanted to any day of the week.No it's not. I love the fact that this huge game doesn't have some cutesy name to it.

If I had to choose something, I'd go with something like "Battle of the Gulf" or something ridiculous like that, given the Gulf of Mexico being right there. It's a stupid name, I know.I love Tony Alford's little anecdote about Dexter Williams' first visit.There you go. I'm sure the veterans would love it, too...[WE USED TO BE **HUGE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaQUSVOupE)What...it's nice...especially nicer than it used to be...but I can't possibly think that Hyde Park is nicer than Evanston.Win out, beating Stanford.

Some CCG winner that's not B12 has to have 2-losses.

Baylor and TCU (and/or whoever else is at the top of the B12) probably both need a loss, but it's *possible* that ND's resume at 11-1 is seen as better than theirs at 12-0 at season's end.Hah, that's True.That's...the perfect way to describe the differences.When Dex visited, he was telling him they'd have coats and everything waiting for him....also it was Dexter's first time seeing snow...and he loved it.

[I think it's in this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBc2LsGwSs8)This is exactly what I've been saying about Richt. Who? Who the hell can UGA pull that will give them BETTER overall success than he has right now? (and USC might be looking at the same guy..and can outbid UGA easily) One bad season...and he's coming off a 10-3 year while being 5-3 right now. Regardless of the scoring struggles, you don't just go and fire a dude with his track record/longevity in the program. No offense, but UGA is not Alabama, they're not USC, they're not Texas...and yet these fans calling for Richt seem to think they are (yes, I get that UGA is the flagship in a great recruiting state, but there's more to it than that).

I just really don't want to see a program I have kind of a soft spot for make a silly decision and then end up with a Willingham/Weis situation...a situation a non-blue blood may have a really rough time recovering from if they managed to pull the trigger on the wrong guy. Also bear in mind that a season like 2013 was in large part because of injuries. If anything, I think they should really explore coordinator/other staff changes first, not HC changes.

If Mark Richt can't go 10-4, 12-2, 8-5, 10-3 and keep his job, then who the hell in their right mind would take that position?Doing everything they can to ensure he stays and doesn't look at any other jobs?Will Fuller can outrun him, too, just like Adoree.

*runs* ^^but ^^not ^^fast ^^enough ^^to ^^get ^^away

All kidding aside, though, USC is going to be one of the fastest teams in CFB on the field if they keep pulling these types of guys in. That alone is scary.Older one, but i love it.He didn't run right through him, so much as make a small juke to the inside and faked him out. I still think Nicky shouldn't have gotten beat on that move, though. Then again, as Greek said, that IS a bit of a tough position to come in right off the bench...Nope, just halfway through the second game...and starting RB on like his third carry in the first game.I'm hopeful for TTU that Kolin Hill can come in next year and have a big impact...if your DC sets him up for success, he could be a great addition.&gt;At this point the only thing BC can hope for is to ruin Notre Dame's season, always a worthy goal.

Oh I hate you BC, because this is ALWAYS possible. :pJoe Montana.

He's Joe Montana.Gonna be interesting to see how ND handles replacing Grant and Connaughton, though. Huge losses.Fuck, that sucks.

Probably from tossing too many Utes to the side.In a similar vein, anyone know who else of the 1-loss teams only has their loss to an undefeated team? (didn't think creating a whole new thread for this question alone was a good idea)

edit: UF's loss is to LSU, so that's one. MAYBE the only one, come to think of it.*twitch*

:'(Jon Gruden*I* am your father.[Search your feelings, you know it to be True. Join me.](http://i.imgur.com/pvorT.gif)In no particular order:

Notre Dame vs USC

Michigan vs Ohio State

Alabama vs Auburn

Texas vs Oklahoma

Army vs Navy

Offseason vs SeasonND/USC compares to those easily. Outside of recent events, the Iron Bowl was simply NOT on the national radar like OSU/UM, ND/USC, Texas/OU, etc. have been for quite a while.

edit: Obviously, this will be met with exception, most likely from fans who are too young to remember what CFB was like over a decade ago. That said, the Iron Bowl is absolutely huge now.Prepping for a potential upset, I see.http://i.imgur.com/ORETsvC.gifLSU is simply the worst place to play if you are an opposing team.Any human being at USC should be able to out-recruit UCLA. To some extent, USC sells itself and UCLA does not. (in football)Words I never thought I'd say a few years ago:

I'm really fucking pumped for that Temple/Memphis game.You?Clemson (specifically TheClemsonInsider and TigerNet) likes to take things a bit out of context to get their fans all riled up, apparently. They did the exact same thing for some of the pre-ND game comments from some of ND's players.Zero respect for Michigan. Zero. Fun. Sir.Yeah, his awkwardness was perfect.Yeah, his success jump actually directly correlates with the hire of Chad Morris in 2011, which is why some I think were concerned how things would progress with him taking the job at SMU. And then Venables was added in 2012, which is where the Clemson defense really started to become what it is now.It's "fun" to read the forums sometimes, though.Yeah, that's why I put "who else"...perhaps I didn't make that clear.Injuries. Motherfucker.~~I'm getting real tired of your shit, FireRicht Crowd/Internet.~~

I get it now. Went through the questions... I picked Steve Spurrier. Interesting...I was missing the question thing....Noscript blocked it. I was...confused.

:(

So, you predict Iowa will be a top 7-8 team...and then rant against your own prediction?

And who the hell spells out someone's record, like "6 and 2"? ;p

&gt;would you argue music with Eddie Van Halen?

As an avid jazz listener (to a snobbish degree), yes.

&gt;Would you argue food with Wolfgang Puck?

His canned soups aren't that great.

&gt;Would you argue Film making with Martin Scorsese?

Maybe.

&gt;Iowa knows Osborne and Alvarez, the two key people in the committee.

Bro, you know multiple schools have connections to individuals on the committee, right? Like ND and Stanford both have a connection with Condi? And, ironically, Ty coached at both schools.

edit: every school, changed to "multiple schools" as that wasn't the correct way to word that.That's awesome.Yes.

I believe this is where the phrase "wake up sheeple!" comes in.Britney Spears also made millions. Doesn't mean her music is that great, or more importantly especially complex/requiring a boatload of knowledge/talent. It's pop, it's designed to appeal to the masses, just like a lot of rock/heavy metal music is extremely basic at its core.

It's actually scientifically known that most recent music has been *designed* to be less cerebral, and hard rock/metal like Van Halen also applies.

Not saying he's not great (as I do like some of his stuff), but there's a lot more going on in a Wes Montgomery solo than there is an Eddie Van Halen solo.Let's be fair, in True GRRM fashion...everyone should fear for their lives, not just visiting players.So was Utah...

Actually Utah is like the Ron Paul, HUGE at one point but basically irrelevant on Reddit in favor of the new guy (Bernie, Clemson)I like how Alabama's loss is to a now-20th ranked Ole Miss team and yet they get the benefit of the doubt of the 1-loss teams.

Then again, I kind of understand it.Something tells me this spelling was autocorrected. It's perfect.
B12, not SEC.

*runs*Zip it up and zip it out.Perfectly spaced (for me, anyway)

What you need to know is Aggies will be even more excited if Kansas pulls the upset.Is this a job application? Because I'd totally be down with coaching in Hawaii.Ahh yes...

"The Pete Carroll"Should have said "it makes you want to do the right thing each and every day, like beating Bama."Nice try, puntageddon.I can't tell you how much I love this intro, every damned time."Here IS ten reasons why"

Bama fan confirmed.Nah, they were fired.Please, continue.A CHIEF DRUNKEN WANDERER SHALL NOT DRINK. HOWEVER IF HE SHOULD DRINK HE SHALL NOT GET DRUNK. IF HE SHOULD GET DRUNK HE SHALL NOT WANDER. AND IF HE SHOULD WANDER HE SHALL NOT FALL, AND IF HE SHOULD FALL, HE WILL FALL IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO COVER UP HIS RANK SO THAT PASSERSBY WILL THINK HE IS A SOBER WANDERER!

AHHHHH!Oh, I see it now.Tiger God wants a rematch, too.

*swiggity swooty*He did that thing after the kick return in he MCB. So there's that.Frankly, I'm a big fan of [Kizer flapping his owl wings at Temple players](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWjFXXywnY8NSW6US1qs0jPoJFw=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4217761/flap.0.gif)

The context for this is that a Temple player was ripping at the ball halfway or more into the endzone, lol, so Kizer turned to him and did this.

[Vine of it](https://vine.co/v/e3JeIg2UF2a)looolWow, that's hilarious that someone actually made this.Damn......TIL.Bye week is literally the black knight.The crowd goes wild.I'm going to need a truckload of popcorn.&gt; Yeah it kinda sucked that every time Notre Dame's offense was out it was all rainy and windy and wet and then when Clemson's offense took the field everything magically dried up and became perfect playing conditions

At least you're finally acknowledging the weather bias.We did this like....a couple days ago.Time to check ASU's football inflation practices.That is True. Fair enough.Notre Dame. As long as the dude wasn't all threatening and stuff, ND is very accepting of those with other beliefs, IMO. Te'o was Mormon, for example.Parents always find a way to make things awkward for their kids.Hah, I was at that MSU/ND game. To this day, I still remember an ND fan from the top screaming down "Get Smoker!" almost all game. It was hilarious and annoying at the same time.Yes, has been posted from numerous outlets.

&gt;and the report indicates a player on the world famous Notre Dame football team was also involved in the sex scandal.

From this line alone, we can see the True colors of "The Daily Caller" website (whoever the fuck that is). The "world famous" part is just oozing with sarcasm/attitude.No.If the candidate showed strong morals and a good attitude that aligned with the school's mission, yes I totally believe they'd be accepted. Some may seem to think that just because ND is a religious institution that it means they're in line with your average backwater Southern Baptist crazies, when that couldn't be further from the truth IMO.Just like Baylor, until it proves to cost them a game...I don't think either team should be penalized for having a different QB.So what you're saying is that Clemson is due for some trouble?I mean, everyone was also talking about Miami simply because of Al Golden's presence and waiting for him to be fired.So he's transferring to Notre Dame next year. Got it.

Oh look, a backfield with Fournette, Prosise, and Folston.I'll watch both. When ND is on, all other games are off. But with MSU/Vols, I can stand to watch those simultaneously with others.&gt;Things get weird in the ACC. 

[The ACC in one GIF](http://i.imgur.com/GtxQvoH.gif)Well MSU IS the premiere program in the State of Michigan now.Anyone have a link to the current complete list?

Also consider that this has to be a coach that USC (Southern Cal, not South Carolina) isn't interested in, because UGA flat out can't compete with them.I wouldn't say "nothing alike". I'd say UGA and Nebraska are both more similar that you're giving them credit for. Monetarily, I think Nebraska could pay about that much ($4M), too, if they had the right candidate they were really sold on. Bo Pelini was right above 3 million, IIRC, before his firing.

They both have a solid history and a vocal fanbase, on top of this, they are both top programs that are just below the truly "premiere program" line like you see in USC, Texas, etc. And while Nebraska doesn't "live in" a solid recruiting state, their name carries a lot of weight nationally (more so than UGA, IMO), in part thanks to their 90s/2000s success, so I believe their recruiting level could  easily rival that of UGA's over a relatively short period of time with the right staff.Okay. Solid response. The phrase "threatening and stuff" was not the best choice of words, I'll give you that. But from everything I know about the school, past and present, it wouldn't be some massive problem.[More Richt posts.](http://media.giphy.com/media/46itMIe0bkQeY/giphy.gif)Dammit who put that on the teleprompter!I think UGA will win one more at least before they meet GT.

Kentucky, Auburn, and GaSo could all even be wins...but I'd be surprised if they don't win at LEAST one of them.That would certainly be something.Little hostile, aren't we?&gt;It was all "ND is deeper, by keeping deshaun limited in the passing game ND's superior talent all around will win out." 


&gt;superior talent all around

I don't think anybody realistic said ND had outright superior talent "all around", at least when it came to the starters, if anything that was probably some TCI or TigerNet garbage being flung about. Or you're just creating that narrative yourself to play the victim. Most often that I saw, it was said to be strength vs strength, ND's OL vs Clemson's DL. Clemson's DL played a hell of a game and won the run defense battle. But, on the pass plays, if you watch the game again, ND's pocket protection was still pretty damned solid.

&gt;depth

The depth thing is somewhat True. I can't think of any Clemson fan that doesn't acknowledge that their depth is somewhat thin right now, although over the course of the season it's been getting better with the experience they're getting. Unfortunately, ND's depth is also being tested due to all their injuries, one of which occurred early on in the Clemson game to ND's LG Quenton Nelson, and another of which occurred the week prior to ND's best blocker at TE Luatua. Those two were key losses that contributed to ND's inability to run block for Prosise against an extremely talented Clemson DL.

&gt;People want to twist the narrative any way they can to discredit that win. 

Just like Clemson fans want to say they took their foot off the gas, while not lending ANY credit to the possibility that ND made adjustments and played terribly early on. If only there were other games that displayed similar behaviors from this ND team....oh wait, there are. They've been somewhat streaky against every opponent they've played since Texas. Nobody has gotten a full 4 quarters from this ND team since then. That, of course, would require watching this team play and keying in on certain aspects of the way they play defense quarter-to-quarter, especially.

Either way, Clemson played their tails off and won the game.In the "No" column.I swear to god I'll pistol whip the next person that posts a Fire Mark Richt story.Can ND get their injured players back now, too? :([PUT THOSE AWAY!](http://i.imgur.com/v2USOjw.jpg)How To Stop 2014 Golson 101/r/firemarkrichtSo that makes TWO coaches the players support that USC won't hire.This isn't about /r/cfb, this is about firing Mark Richt...the most important thing since firing Al Golden.Nice try, Iowa fan.AHHHHHHH.....Well, if ND had a week between UMass and Clemson, Luatua would have been back, which would have helped immensely for the run game. So maybe not just prep, but injury recovery as well, which would have been huge.Ole Miss wasn't throwing buckets of money at their program when he was there like they are now. I think in the right environment, a coach that has that kind of player support can flourish and gets the best out of them.I did, and it makes some very solid points. I was just making a joke for karma.Most pro-Clemson posts are made my Clemson fans.

Most pro-Alabama posts are made by Alabama fans.

Most pro-USC posts are made by USC fans.

Most pro-Texas posts are not made by A&amp;M fans, I can assure you of that.

There's some kind of pattern here.Just woke up from a nap.

[Hey guys, what's going on?](http://i.imgur.com/biDFHU0.gif)This guy gets it.Cheerio good chap!In True PITT fashion, they could fuck everything up.I'm always rooting for LSU between the two of them.[Fly away, little owl.](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWjFXXywnY8NSW6US1qs0jPoJFw=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4217761/flap.0.gif)&gt;A la Michigan State winning on a miracle compared to ND losing by only two to Clemson. Compare them both and ND's is more impressive as a body of work.

Careful, this is how you attract the "BUT VIRGINIA!" crowd.Same. I mean...we're a little biased, though.Hey look, something we can agree on! (also especially your Vols flair...which I hadn't noticed until recently)


^^^^^:DIt's the 2nd one, and that happens when we meet in the playoff for a rematch. :DIf you can't get past FSU, I will be mad. Although, I can't say I don't still have a soft spot for Golson.Right here.Because they do.

Also, because you're Bama's rival.*rains on your parade*I mean...let's be honest....we're saying this because they played such a close game with ND.Oh good.Good. Fuck'em.Nice try, Redditor.I mean...that's kinda scary for the kids. Someone should be actively researching this and then hopefully working on reducing/eliminating this possibility.I'm starting to realize that I'm *really* old around here. This explains the bitterness.If I say it now, they won't. That's how this works, right?Zero. Conference. Wins.

What BS.Shh, still have to play PITT.There really is only one approach to these threads if you're a Bama fan.

I'm waiting for the "Notre Dame at #5" thread.Offseason, WHY. CAN'T. YOU. JUST. DIE!?!!?!!?

This is literally impossible.This is why I'm not a fan of the subreddit growth. It's clear that most (not all) of the additional subs are been low-quality posters at best.YOU GO TO HELL, PITT!edit: I think I misunderstood the question...maybe?


I'd say

Clemson wins out

Bama wins out

ND wins out

OSU wins out

Baylor wins out, but still gets bumped out just because their SOS is worse than ND's who would slide in at #4 after a big win @Stanford.This title also forgot "Strength of schedule".This might be the stupidest thing I've ever read. They said themselves in the CFP criteria outline at one point that MARGIN (of win only, I believe) does NOT matter, so putting up absurd nunbers of points aginst the Lamars and Kansas(es) of the world shouldn't matter.It's later in the night, so it'll only be 50% sodium.So we ignore the other 9 teams on the schedule. Got it. That seems to be what you're saying anyway.I will say I agree with this entirely.I'm feeling okay right now. And everyone is bitching about Bama at #4 to pull all the attention away.Who let TigerNet out of its cage?! :pAgreed, same would also apply for Baylor and TCU as well if they were #1. Over time, though, these things change.16th Notre Dame, below Ole Miss with 2 losses, Alabama with 1...to Ole Miss...let's see below....UTAH?! A team who got killed by USC literally the week after ND beat the Trojans?I'm having trouble with Utah over ND, given the USC result.Posted earlier...somewhere.

edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3rdqam/you_dont_know_dabo/Ahh, I can't read.Fair enough.I don't care who it is. I just want to see Hawaii good again. Late games would be awesome, if the crowds started showing up again especially.Hey, App is 7-1 right now and their facilities had gotten a solid upgrade recently.*waits for OP's SCar or FSU flair*And it's also not like NCSU isn't a good team.Clemson's "incredibly weak schedule"? That's...an exaggeration.I'm not even talking about ND. Take ND out of it...you still have a 7-1 AppState, now 5-3 NCSU, now 4-4 Louisville, and 5-3 Miami. It's really NOT the worst slate so far if you actually know what you're talking about.That doesn't change that the phrase "incredibly weak schedule" is a gross exaggeration, which was my point. Now, start comparing them to all the other undefeateds, who has played a MUCH better schedule than Clemson so far, since theirs is "incredibly weak"?You're still avoiding naming undefeated teams that have played schedules so far that are heads and shoulders above Clemson's allegedly "incredibly weak schedule" (your words) to date, which was part of the premise of your initial post. So...any time you want to do that, let me know.

&gt;ND will not.

ND just played and beat a top 25 and undefeated Temple team. Pitt is a 6-2 team. Stanford has a very solid shot to come into the ND game at 10-1. Wake and BC don't necessarily help matters.Baylor plays tougher teams than Ohio State.

Hah! Take that!ND not even in the top 10. Vegas is a silly place anyway. :p (biased)

Also, bear in mind Vegas bases a LOT of their stuff off of stats/number-crunching and not watching the games/teams in question.You're not helping the BashClemsonFest!

Hey, where'd you pull these from?Notre Dame, Notre Dame would be ahead of you. :pNO, FUCK YOU, MAD NOW! WE SHOULD BE #1 ALL THE TIME!

2007 NOTRE DAME WAS THE BEST TEAM IN THE COUNTRY AND NOBODY KNEW IT!ND could end up with a rematch with both LSU and Clemson.

That is both exciting and terrifying. Mostly terrifying.Last time we used that...things didn't turn out so well.Underperform is an overstatement, sadly. And, given that record, I can't really blame anyone. I, for one, am absolutely petrified of getting into the CFP, but also excited about it. I also saw a projection of ND/TCU in a NY6 bowl. Yes, ND's secondary against TCU's offense. Yes, that would most certainly be a great game that wouldn't cause me to crawl up into a hole and die.Any minute now...No, this is finally more about fucking football and what goes on on the field, not who did what on campus during their personal time.The real reason Fournette is actually secretly a complete asshole: he's TOO good in every way.

edit: do I really need "/s"?Not just a fan, she actually went there.[This was used a lot last year](https://i0.wp.com/i.minus.com/iPydduaC5I5sr.gif)I never even got one, because I'm not an idiot.*shrugs*Yes.I really think we need to stop all these "campaigns to get Gameday".**NO.**God, I wish we could ban idiots that use the same old message board garbage.

No flair, seemingly never posts in /r/CFB. Seems about right.

edit: and just like that, has flair.&gt;If Tennessee were to play Temple today, who do you think would win? 

Honestly? I think that with the Vols' OL, Temple's defense would give them absolute fits. People seem to think that just because a team that is *perceived* to be lower gives ND problems, that means anyone else could beat the crap out of them, and it pervades every internet conversation about teams ND plays close...similar to the way anyone who doesn't know anything still harps on closer games ND plays with Navy with "lol but it's Navy", always from fans of teams who never have the balls to schedule Navy. Check out the way they played National Champs OSU last year, for example, albeit in Week 1.I mean, we did...but that has nothing to do with this conversation and was with last year's team...or what was left of ND's team last year on defense. With the way Harris is playing and another year of experience for their WRs, this LSU offense is definitely a fair bit different compared to the one we saw in the MCB.I think that their downfield passing is a massive addition and a dimension which they really didn't have going when we played them. And, given ND's secondary issues that everyone should be familiar with at this point, that could pose to be a problem in such a matchup, especially when combined with Fournette. And, with the way Russell has been playing outside of his few "save the day" INTs, Riggs was the better CB last year by comparison (who played in that MCB).

I'm accounting for what we know about both teams on the field this year, which is the most important comparison. Not some "well our players and talent grew just like they did" point you are trying to make. Every game comes down to matchups, and I don't necessarily believe we match up as well this year compared with the LSU in the MCB we played. That said, over the rest of the season, ND could totally have me changing my mind in that regard.You must be new to CFB conversations.It's not that I can't debate it, it's that I can't bring myself to have the same conversation with the type of individuals who continue to bring that garbage line up, every year without fail.

I come here to escape that that decades-old line (back when it actually held more water), not converse about it.Depends on what that Conference Champ's record is and who their wins are against, I'd wager.Christ, just look at the spread/disparity when it comes to SoS. OSU sticks out like a sore thumb in the top 5 right now. That said, they're a bit backloaded, so that will get better.I avoid every one of those sites like the plague.[It looks like teamrankings' SoS rankings](https://www.teamrankings.com/college-football/ranking/schedule-strength-by-other)Please no. Not this. God dammit.I think this line of conversation started by the OP is pointless at this stage, and creating a post just to complain about how someone is getting "paid off" is...not the best idea.I kind of want to push him myself.&gt;  eh yeah we do fuck Dantonio

[:|](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvVzNdOiVOM/maxresdefault.jpg)

&gt;But, people are ignoring that they set this up for a 2 v 4 match up this weekend so they could push rating.

Yeah, there is FAR too much reading into the first initial rankings going on here.I like ECU's current uniforms. That...is about to change.*checks for UGA flair*I think Fuente or someone like that could be a solid get. But, I'd like for VT to get a guy they know they can hold onto for a while like Beamer to kind of keep in line with that "tenured coach" theme. Perhaps not quite as long, though.

I'm not really positive which of pulling from P5 coordinator or G5 HC pool is the smarter choice.That's why I hate to see the same line of convo pop up that typically is limited to those types of sites. It waters down the actual quality of conversation.I love these threads.

1) Ohio State

2) Notre Dame

3) Alabama

4) USC

Why? Because everyone gets mad.Notre Dame beat them. Duh.Homer.Please, make it stop.This angers everyone. I like the way you think.So much so that I've even decided to get back in the business.

What bullshit.[...](http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/please-no-more.gif)And apparently Notre Dame bias now, too.I predict PITT pisses me off and plays a ridiculously close game...and everyone will forget that their record was 6-2 and act like ND barely escaped with a win against Lamar.http://i.imgur.com/JWxGE.gifWe all knew it wasn't going to last for more than 24 hours.Meh, let's forget the hurricane and just call it a two point loss @Clemson who had double the rest/prep time.You forgot the phrase "pack it in".OOOOHhhhh.Get out of here with your logic.If I can look over at the sideline and figure out what someone is doing, then yeah they probably deserve to have them "stolen". Also, if you can't adjust and perhaps audible out of plays that the other team seems to have "pegged", then your OC isn't doing his job.I hate today.We should have a name for these, something like "BrilesPost".

*runs*Two of which were great plays by Clemson, especially the one by their kicker to start the half. Still part of the game.Welp, someone is getting pistol-whipped.

Come here /u/bumli That helmet on the ball had zero to do with the rain. If it were bone dry, that's still a fumble. It's just rare that someone, especially the kicker, gets that heads-up of a play on the ball.&gt; Should ND get any credit for being the last team to beat LSU?

No, that was last year's team...and in a middling bowl, definitely not a NCG.Let's be honest, ND plays okay in the mid-tier bowls..but they have yet to deliver more than a lackluster performance in the big ones.
I know for sure ND needs the B12 to eliminate themselves for the most part. BUT I think they have a SLIM (I said SLIM, calm down) shot at making it in if Baylor is the lone undefeated B12 team at season's end. Their schedule may be backloaded with three great teams, but that doesn't change the other nine opponents (which include SMU, Lamar, Kansas, ISU, and a dying KSU). I know people like OU to perhaps make it through, but I think if it's between an 11-1 OU and an 11-1 ND, ND CLEARLY gets the nod. They have a similar opponent. One team beat the crap out of Texas (although this was in part before the injuries started), one lost to them.Both teams have a wealth of talent and coaching. And with teams like that, they can win any day of the week.&gt; Can't forget about that.

Can't forget about something three years ago that has no bearing on this ND team's abilities. Also, that was against possibly he best of Bama's 3 NC teams...and they blew out each team they saw all 3 NCGs they won, yet people only hold it against ND...not LSU or Texas. Shocker.

&gt;This year: I sincerely doubt they can get by Stanford, in Palo Alto.

I have my doubts as well, but ND has played well @Stanford every year they play out there, including in 2013 when Rees was the QB...against that Rose Bowl Stanford team. It's a concern because of what they have on their team, not because it's in Palo Alto. But, I DO think ND CAN win that game and has the talent to do so.I keep forgetting to hold onto this for later use. Hopefully, I can use it every week until the end of the CFP.It's debatable, given Baylor's overall schedule. There's a difference between "undefeated conference champion" in the B12 and an undefeated conference champ in the other four, as the other undefeated conference champs would have 13 wins in total (edit: or 12 for anyone who plays an FCS school, like I noted for Baylor in the next sentence). Baylor would have 12...one of which is a middling FCS squad which really shouldn't hold any merit, kind of putting your win total down to 11 (the same as ND at 11-1). This is why it's about overall resume and not just the transparent backloading of schedules that the B12 is doing right now to try and propel one of their teams into the CFP based solely one one month of football.I was there. I was sad and angry, and cold.Even though I think it should be 8, with every expansion you reduce the importance of winning every, or almost every, game.&gt;Notre Dame isn't even a good team.

I mean, they managed to "beat" LSU last year. Not sure what you're basing this "assessment" on.

&gt;They just have a favorable schedule.

So has LSU up until recently.God damn, the "B12 defense" hits just keep coming.I was hoping for an "unlike B12 defenses" response. This works, too.I wouldn't call that trouncing a quality loss for AppState. Quality losses usually still have to be competitive.You're goddamn right.Big 12 Backloading helps this. :p

Sad that PITT can't be ranked this week for our game. :(....I...actually like AppState, too.No, for at least two of those off the top of my head.

MissSt would have gotten MURDERED by the 4 teams in the actual CFP, just like they got killed in their actual NY6 bowl by GT, didn't play Treadwell-less Ole Miss close really at all, and really were overmatched by Bama in that game.

Baylor played well against MSU early on, but once MSU figured things out in the third they shut them down. I have a hard time believing that they would have been all that competitive against a defense like Bama's or FSU's secondary...which were both better than MSU's, IMO.Please, feel free to correct me if I did any of this math wrong, as I can sometimes not add things up correctly or miss a number.

Texas 3-5

Combined: 29-10

Definitely a big disparity in remaining games (you also have one more remaining than ND, though. If we threw Temple on the back end and did "the last 5" it'd be much closer with their 7-1 record), but when it comes to the first part with games already played, there's also a MASSIVE disparity in ND's favor. Are we supposed to throw the first 2/3 opponents of yours out the window?

&gt;Sure those teams are a combined 30-1 at the moment, but they all play Kansas

Those three (TCU, OKSt, and OU) are also a combined 23-1 (8+8+7 is 23, right?), not 30-1, which you apparently just made up unless I'm missing something....which is possible.
&gt;Sure, maybe one of those wins isn't over a decent OOC opponent but do you really think Baylor would have lost to someone like Minnesota? 

We're talking about the Minnesota team that played TCU withing 6? Speculation? It's possible. This was also an away game for TCU, and Baylor struggles away sometimes, as we all know, so yeah I think they'd have some issues with Minnie if they played them up in Minneapolis. But we don't know this, because they didn't play Minnesota, they played Lamar, SMU, and Rice OOC. I agree they decimated Rice.Or #1 USC PITT is currently 6-2, FYI.

Your own list shows the disparity in the middle section, specifically ~~two~~ three lines. Once we get to PITT, who is 6-2...that's supposed to compare with TTU at 5-4? Newsflash: PITT plays defense, too. Navy is supposed to compare at 6-1 with Rice at 4-4? Come on.

And wait....you're putting FCS Lamar at 4-4 next to fucking 5-3 USC? Just stop, I can't even take you seriously with that one.That was True before. Most of their scheduling right now DOES boil down to back when they weren't very good, so they're the victims of that. As the next 3-5 years pop up, their schedule will start to get tougher.

For example, in 2017, they have Duke on their OOC slate.

What will really show is in the 2018 and beyond category, which unfortunately takes a while to pan out.Their OOC scheduling is weak right now, but that's also because they are the victims of their scheduling practices when their program wasn't very good. Over the next ~4-5 years, expect to see better ones pop up. Duke is on their 2017 slate right now, for example.ITT: give me gold so I can test this out!

inb4 "they seem to be missing MY team's best True freshman"ND dodged the bullet for about half a day. Bammers weren't loud enough.This may sound nuts (it does in my own head, too), but it should be mandated in a contract that if they leave for the NFL they return within X amount of years to finish their education. If they don't, they owe the number of years' tuition they decided to forego. I really don't see a problem with that, IF these are supposed to be *college* football teams. If not, they're just prep factories for the NFL.I'd wager Daniel Tosh would LOVE to see Dolphins vs Bama.I didn't say Joey Freshwater.And ND/Stanford, which I'm not expecting to win exactly right now.On the one hand, I want to see ND in the CFP. On the other hand...I'm so very afraid, given their history of big/BCS bowl games.[Holy fucking shitballs.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/make_it_stop_boy_meets_world.gif)

That's a $300 hat, bitch."Notre Dame plays an easy schedule."*punch*

Ow!I'd certainly rather play regular-season Bama, not NCG Bama.LSU REALLY runs that much more than they pass, up until now. Since Harris has started to open up their passing game, though, I honestly think that gap will close a little bit over the course of the rest of the year. Given Bama's front 7, we could see a lot more out of that aspect of their offense, too, this weekend.Clemson/Baylor by a long shot.If Bama ended up shutting them out again, that...would be interesting.Since before then, really.Notre Dame.

[Next question.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvVzNdOiVOM/maxresdefault.jpg)Lucas Oil doing another Super Bowl some time soon could really put them into the running for a CFP bid somewhere in the next decade. I think they're focusing more on the SB possibilities again before they try for the CFP, which is why they didn't apply.Boo you!I was told by Mr. Lumbergh that I could chuckle at a reasonable volume.Fun fact: every time I go to a home game, it's either a loss or a clusterfuck

2014: UNC

2013: MSU

2012: PITT

2011: fucking USF

This year, due to life stuff, I've unfortunately not made any, and obviously with only one game left it may not happen unless I get free for ND/Wake. I'm kind of okay with not going to any games this year after going to a bunch last year, actually. Three to be precise.So all the ones who use Bama as a stepping stone to the NFL and nothing more. I'd love to see their majors.Yeah, ah well, Just making a little bit of a jab more than anything, frankly. Although I really would be curious.No, it gives us something to argue about until next week, when we argue some more and create 100 posts bitching about Alabama's, Ohio State's, or Notre Dame's ranking.

The current week's ranking is the most important thing in the universe. Don't you understand? What the hell is wrong with you people?!I like how they adjusted for "top 30", much like ESPN's "top 11".You have to consider the other games going on that week and contracts their conferences have. That may have just been the best option, similar to ND/Purdue getting the nod in 2013.Yep. More quality additions to the sub. The CFP rankings thread showed up on /r/all yesterday, IIRC, so that "helped".I'm just glad CFB is on so the whole sub has calmed down a little bit.

It's like jangling keys in front of a cat or something.I'm sure the newly found subs are still in the big threads wreaking havoc.This is the dude that was just discussed as potentially starting at QB last week, right? Because, wow.Oh........shit. Wat.How bad is your QB coach/OC if every QB wants out of that unit?This dude just started at QB last week, though, right? It's not like he's a 4th stringer who is never going to see the field.So basically, he's Lane Kiffin without any of the actual OC success.NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

edit: so...not this week, then? ^^pls?So next week we're putting BGSU above Baylor in the CFP poll just to mess with them, right?This seems like a bad idea.

This is a bad idea.I would like to see Notre Dame play a team they can actually beat come big bowl time.That's exactly what I thought until I finally sat down and watching "A Season with ND" tonight. He mentioned "Eagle" or whatever after it happened in the locker room or something.[You got it.](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWjFXXywnY8NSW6US1qs0jPoJFw=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4217761/flap.0.gif)

There's a VINE out there somewhere too which shows the full thing.

[The Vine](https://vine.co/v/e3JeIg2UF2a)

As you can see from the Vine it was only after Matakevich ripped at the ball and stared him down well after being in the endzone. Frankly, I love it, a team with a bit of attitude and nothing too over the top. I get what BK's trying to say, but I don't see this as very serious. Is he going to address every little thing, like Fuller giving a little lip to one of the Temple defenders after a catch he made, too?He would have to go to Cincinnati for that.Now that CFB is over for the night and mods are asleep, we're back to this again...our regularly scheduled "Fuck $BigTeam" broadcast.The ND one got deleted. I was happy and sad at the same time.http://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gifI really don't understand UF being so low, and I haven't seen anyone say that it's acceptable. It's definitely odd to me the disparity between the two.I was getting there. Gotta get at least get a line in first. How else am I going to maintain my reign as *Chief Comment Whore of /r/CFB*?Those are also all the reasons most of us are doubting our own team right now.&gt;Lots of football left.

No! Must...complain....NOW.^^^Psst. ^^^Everyone ^^^acts ^^^like ^^^their ^^^opinion ^^^is ^^^fact.Their biggest thing they need to do is stop the run, not get the pass rush, and we know they can do that...but this is Dalvin. Even without a pass rush, their secondary is good enough to stop *most* of the passing game on their own.[Not sure if Fire Mark Richt post...](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/OGAu_DeKckI/hqdefault.jpg)Yeah, the rule is the main part. I can see Shu's, but nobody will ever be able to sell me on Tuitt's against PITT in 2013. That was the worst targeting call I've ever seen. Possibly even cost ND the game with how big of an impact losing a guy like Tuitt is. Savage was the one that fucking leaned his head into Tuitt, FFS.Don't these services like Sling, etc still have a fair share of outages?No, computers were programmed by people. Wake up sheeple!I mean, one day that'll happen.I'm not saying it is or isn't. It could not be seen as targeting in part because he never launched. But, that's not the only criteria, it's also about being defenseless (and that receiver could be consTrued as being such in a manner of speaking). TTU's tackler also never made a single attempt to hit/tackle around the torso or lower at all (kind of across the body, like the rugby tackle they were talking about with Pete Carroll a while back, which takes the head out of the tackle) either, almost faceplanting into the receiver's facemask at a point where the receiver wasn't exactly in a position to protect his head in any way, making direct head to head contact, which is what I think caused them to call it. Honestly, if he had hit him with his shoulder and not facemask-to-facemask, I think he wouldn't have been called at all.

The punishment is the biggest issue right now, though.Exactly. I've resigned to the fact that I'm going to have cable for around the next 3-5 years, given all the games I watch.*One True Co-Champion* ^^^that's ^^^not ^^^getting ^^^into ^^^the ^^^CFP

:DThe 15 yarder this year no longer sticks if it's overturned.I want to beat the absolute shit out of PITT if not just because of this call. And they're PITT.I'm pretty sure the deal doesn't guarantee literally every MAC game is on an ESPN channel. In fact, Sun Belt may have a deal for at least one ESPN channel (ESPNU or something) for Thursday night games.

Also, ESPN doesn't always show (like the ticker on TV) when it's on a non-ESPN channel. This isn't new.Fuck.

&gt;\u201cwas hit in the third quarter of Tuesday night's playoff game, and collapsed a short time later.\u201d A representative of the Kansas State High School Activities Association told CBS that officials did not see Schemm sustain any apparent head injuries during the game.

So what was the context of the hit mentioned in the third quarter, then?First off, better tackling techniques from PeeWee on, and they have to be absolutely vigilant about it. Secondly, they're going to need better screening than they even have now for concussion, etc. protocols. It's possible that even after ANY truly violent head-on hit that you'll have to start taking a player out of the game. If your tackling technique is adjusted and they stick to it, then those truly violent hits should become more and more rare, anyway.Well yeah. It's a multi-faceted approach. With all the money in and around the sport, there's no reason why it shouldn't get done, IMO. It's either that, or the ones making the big money are taking the FanDuel approach of just "make as much as we can now before it all gets shut down".I think that's a good thing that we're finding out about it, though. For stuff like this we shouldn't just be going "well the reason why this is such a big deal is because we're hearing about it more". I'm not saying that's what people are doing, but for some news stories, that's the reaction we get.I mean, I do LIKE UGA...just not when they play Tennessee. Also...bad coaching changes are something ND is quite familiar with, so it hits a little close to home.Yeah, that's the other thing. If the NFL players stopped celebrating their blowups, then I think that could go a LONG way to showing that you can do it without risking both sides of the tackle's health. The NFL should take a very active role in this as well, if they truly care about the community. Frankly, they should because if things don't change, more and more parents aren't going to let their kids play...eventually slowing the talent flow over the next couple decades.Don't you have one with underscores in it or something? Or is that someone else?&gt;Texas AM and Auburn are the same team.

Except one is more successful this year.Is that not you?No, see his reply.And they're trying to set up for a Blockbuster of a game between ND and Stanford, too, at the end of the season. The only problem is they're not familiar with ND Football enough to understand that we'll probably end up dropping one of PITT or BC.And I'm not even anti-Auburn.

._.

I just made an observation.And I was just thinking to myself "with all the stuff going on yesterday, today is kind of boring..."To be fair, ti's still better than Lamar, SMU, Northwestern State, and a couple others they've had recently.KSU wins 42-35 scoring exclusively on pick sixes. /s

Honestly, Baylor's offense probably won't skip a beat...and I'm pretty sure Stidham is a more mobile threat, too.&gt; Also Baylor was going to cancel the TCU series after 2011.

Wait...WHAT?Consider that TCU and Baylor had been playing a lot longer than UM/ND...since neither of them bitched out when the other one started winning.

ND/UM meetings: 42

TCU/Baylor Meetings: 110[UGA what is happening to you?!](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/568/895/UGAHouse_original.gif)

Also, he should be punching his OC more so than his DC.That was not Lane Kiffin. I believe it was a guy named Joe.I mean...FEI is kinda shitty...but this says good things about my team, soo....FEI is perfect.I was expecting Illuminati.Welp, now I definitely know ND isn't #3. :p[I just found this.](http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/dle0285zcdzdryyoaobw.jpg)[WHAT DID I SAY?!](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--FYylJBDD--/19djz51f0j8qrjpg.jpg)The only way they could affect Golson last year was when they loaded 8+ in the box. He doesn't check ALL the time, like a few plays against Cuse last year which then allowed ASU figure out their defensive approach which wreaked all sorts of havoc. He did miss multiple hot reads in that ASU game to pick up blockers, at least one of which led to the blindsided fumble. To say he "doesn't check" would be slightly inaccurate, but he definitely doesn't do well at picking them up, which even in ND's system last year, much like FSU's, the onus is on the QB.

Also, bear in mind that even WITH the struggles at times against Cuse last year, that was the game Golson went 25 completions in a row, lol. Long as you can get the ball out of his hands fast enough, it's not that big of a deal. Or...as long as HE can get the ball out of his hands fast enough.Word is yes, or at least "just as". Maybe I'm just thinking of the flat-out speed factor, which I think Stidham has the edge in.I think another factor, which may be even bigger, is that Golson uses more of the pocket to move around than Maguire, typically (part of this could be due to his height behind some linemen). And, similar to I believe an NFL conversation I heard recently, that can cause problems if your linemen don't know where you are...especially if it's not that great of an OL.Never said they weren't (which is why I mentioned getting the ball out of his hands fast enough). But, outside of the shorter completion streak, a decent number of longer passes were thrown, including what ended up being a 72 yard bomb for a TD, IIRC. He has an arm, he's just been reigned in so much that FSU fans haven't been allowed to see it, justifiably so given some of his issues. Plus, lack of protection doesn't help either. It's also possible that FSU's OL simply doesn't WANT to block for him (new guy taking the spot from Maguire, from a team that almost beat them at home last year...any number of factors could play in). The coaches pushing him away that time on the sideline when he tries to talk to his own OL certainly isn't going to help matters, either.

edit: saw in Inbox, though was replying to an FSU fan, changed from "your" to "FSU"Okay....

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3rneec/just_so_everyone_knows_jeremy_pruitt_is_our/Which is why the OC should be the target, not the DC. I can't possibly understand why the OC isn't what is being discussed as the possible job opening right now.It's kind of the offensive parallel to BVG's defense. It's so complex that players who are two years into the system haven't fully grasped it, so we have players that have ridiculous physical attributes and football instincts like Nyles Morgan who aren't being played because a guy like Schmidt needs to be used to coach everyone into proper positioning before the snap.No shit. Basically every post about UGA comes down to firing someone. ANYONE.

Sounds like Que is about to be fired. Better polish up that resume, dawg!Well after yesterday's complete meltdown regarding Alabama's CFP ranking...are we really that surprised? I wouldn't be shocked if half of these UGA "Stories" are being posted by new subs to /r/CFB.Hopefully just a better version of a head coach. Not of Mike Riley.That would be the ultimate step down. He had one lone truly good year and their top ranking was based upon beating three inflated-ranked "top 10" teams, all three of which ended the year at 8-5 including bowls.Really?Why? Mullen isn't that good of a coach.Their good seasons were (or really the one) also during "down-ish" years for the better of the West, specifically their wins over LSU and Auburn last year. They beat LSU (barely) last year before LSU kind of got their house in order defensively, IMO. And there was a BIG age gap differential between MissSt and the others, IIRC, too. It's not like these teams last year for Bama and LSU were their 2012 and 2011 iterations.Should be easy with this ND secondary. Oh wait...

I'm getting a little sick of KVR SAVING THE DAY after having an overall shit game, and then it's like everyone forgets.Nobody's very shocked with that schedule.

*drives off*Well, to be fair, I don't think there's a single team that's better at "making things exciting" than ND. My heart problems agree.Be glad that's all it is.

*twitch*Or their inability to play offense as well as OkSt. Nobody played defense that game.Top RB + Decommit + Tony Alford = does not computeWh-what are you saying?Oh, okay then. Woohoo.Then what's happening to GT?No.

Fuck No.

Hell No.

Hell Naw.

No. Just No.

The most annoying thing is they try to speak for me as if I'm part of their shitty "Country Nation". Fuck you, you don't define me.Quote all the rules you want, that wasn't targeting. If anyone made "forcible contact with the helmet" is was Savage (although both didn't go DIRECT into each other). Tuitt did his best to stop him before the 1st down by using his shoulder, rolling into him. It just so happens that his head is on top of his shoulders and the helmets clicked together incidentally, and definitely not on the crown.BREAKING: *Notre Dame announces they now practice a punt block return play. The name? Michigeddon.*Exactly. I always have trouble hearing Michigan fans talk about "series record" with the word "shutout" repeatedly screaming in my head.September actually includes part of the season, though. JJ was the preseason Heisman, and that's about it.Oh is everyone getting all their injured players back today?! No?

okay.jpg

:(Kill the offseason.Notre Dame gives me the best heart attacks.lolAny great QB starting for a team with a questionable OL is not an instant fix. No "great QB" can have amazing success with shit protection, and people continue to undervalue the importance of the OL when it comes to how QBs function...and also the familiarity between the two.This will get me burned, most likely.

UNC vs a currently 4-5 VT. Sorry, that's a bad choice. This is telling players (and fans) of the teams that have worked their asses off all season to have a great record that it's more about the highly paid coaches than it is them, who actually play the game.

Frank Beamer did amazing things at VT, I'm not denying that at all.Probably when everyone went apeshit on him like he was the ESPN CEO when he asked for some suggestions. (wasn't that the account you mean, the intern?)"Angry Tuesday"This just means they're going to play ND like they're Bama.I dunno, do they even have a football team?I'm pretty sure they're #6.

*runs*Ah, so \u221eAm I the only one that saw that shot to the face before the FG was kicked?"...not YET."ND jumps to 3, Bama jumps to 2 just to take the heat off.Kinda sad about the way it ended without KSU getting a True chance. Ah well. KSU did their best to hold onto the ball and own ToP, so not that surprised that Baylor's scoring was lower.On the first fucking play, FFS. At least give yourself a chance before you try the tricky bullshit.I thought I locked my liquor cabinet....shit...Would you look at that. You were right.You'd be surprised how many people completely miss obvious sarcasm and get all pissy.:(KSU was a fucking tease. Don't be a tease Mizzou, let's go. Beat MissSt.You're not very proud to be Irish. :(I agree. Hopefully ND blows them out. But...this is PITT, so probably not.Congratulations, now Minkah is about to fuck that up.I was worried you forgot the trademark "!" for a  second there.Looks like Michigan fans have to go since they're the worst team ever.I would...but I'd totally forget on every post and everyone would be mad.It doesn't matter right now. They have Cincy, Memphis and Navy left on the schedule...all good teams. If they perform, they'll get the credit they're due, IMO.Resurrection: The Miracle Season that Saved Notre Dame

Involves Ara Parseghian being hired. Jim Dent also has some other books on other major programs.Let's hope OU wins out. (admittedly *in part* for my own selfish reasons)

BOOMER! SOONER!God dammit Fresno.Welcome to CFB Addicts AnonymousZero. Fun. Sir.It's both for me.Damn man, that sucks.This sub now looks exactly like what I pictured when I become Head Mod.

I am now Head Mod. Box to your Dear Leader.No thanks. Let's keep it this way. It's basically the same anyway.This smells like an OPEN letter.FYI, IIRC Golson's next game after his concussion in 2012 was @OU, something to think about.Well, according to one Auburn fan earlier this week, they're apparently the same team as A&amp;M.I think we had another article earlier in the week covering the difference between the two.I'm sad. On the other hand, I'm not exactly shocked. NCAA is more of a "cult" sports game than the major games you'd expect to be ported. The reason why we think it's so popular is because we're literally on a subreddit dedicated to college football.&gt; So a rain drenched game suits LSU wayyyy better than Bama. 

To be fair, I remember what happened the last time I heard this about a game between two teams this year. :(

Bottom line, you never know what's going to happen or who comes to play or doesn't come to play.Or in October....in Morgantown...the week after their big win over TCU.&gt; My worry is their strategy works and we lose all the great non-conference schedules.

It's not going to work. The CFP committee has already shown that they aren't valuing those types of OOC games. And I believe that they'll stick to their guns over the next few years, too.Wasn't even me this time. I'd just like to point that out.Very early into the article:

&gt;Actually, it was never a done deal.

So, "ducked" is a dumb adjective to use here. Not like ND cancelled after they saw Baylor was getting good....as this article is from 2009.

If anything, ND cancelled because they saw Baylor was a shit team that year that wasn't worth scheduling as they probably had other arrangements already with some lower opponents.I mean...it's kind of a shitpost when it's been done to death every week.It's better when the Ushers get involved, like some fucking librarian.Longer answer still: They are...8 years from now....just like most scheduling is done many years in advance.Damn. What's the completion timeline look like?Damn, that's quick. I'm assuming that means they actually already started on it?Team that lost to Texas vs the team that shut them out.

Texas, I just don't understand you.&gt;I still couldn't figure out what dirt he had on Kelly in order to get there starting position for so long.

Who else were they going to start?

Crist went down with his glass knees in 2010, so Rees was thrust into the starting role. In 2011, Rees was competing against Hendrix (who can't throw the ball at all, I remind you) and a True freshman Golson (redshirted for 2011). And then 2012, when Golson had a year in the system, he was the starter. Then, in 2013, Golson was out because of the academic thing. So, it's not like Rees "had dirt on BK", it's that he was the best option whenever he started.I believe I saw some stat recently that he passed Gronk for TD receptions in the NFL...maybe only for this year?

I'm really dying for them to use our TEs more, which is something BK claimed they were going to do. But, outside of a few and that one Aliz'e pass downfield, I think he's criminally undervaluing the TE pass (and part of this is also probably Kizer going through reads).We play both of your flairs one week after the other.&gt;[Mark Richt and UGA](http://i.imgur.com/9T1kgIr.gif)I dunno. Who names their kid Equanimeous?&gt;Two words: road schedule.

Nice to see the value of this being noticed. It's not just the fact that ND plays some good ones on the road overall, it's also that ND finishes the last 5 games with only one more in South Bend.

@ Temple

@ PITT

vs Wake

@ Fenway (BC)

@ Stanford

And all four of those away games (if you include Fenway) are against some good to great teams, especially defenses.It is also Green. Unless you're colorblind, I think.Literally nobody forgets to remind that Championships were being handed out for free in 2012-13, because they would have been playing 2012 doormat Notre Dame.He was there, but IIRC he was still having knee problems. And plus, Rees knew the offense. Rees was by far the best option, and at this point, it's frankly become a circlejerk amongst ND fans to hate him.

I'm guessing you didn't see Zaire play early on. Zaire had zero touch on his passes initially, he wasn't a viable option. He basically threw the ball halfway to outer space when they were around the endzone. IIRC this was specifically evident during the B/G Game when he first got his chance. People tend to forget that with the recency bias of his LSU and Texas performances. Also, he had some personal issues going on IIRC at that point in time, too, which really kept him from focusing on the game.It's probably because I'm having an off day, but what do you mean by this question?Yeah, wasn't meaning for this to be against OP.Bro, you're not even a year in. It's going to last for a while, trust me.As an ND fan, the nails are a little uncomfortable. THIS ISN'T THE SIGNAL FOR TOUCHDOWN, DAMMIT! I'M NAILED TO A FUCKIN' CROSS!&gt; I find there football team to be full of thugs

What.Well, I meant a year into this hard of a ribbing about your SOS. It took about 2 years to stop hearing "42-14" as a punchline in random threads as a reference to the NCG against Bama, usually from fans of teams not named Bama.That describes me perfectly, and that's exactly what I want.Ahhh, okay yeah. They played a great schedule that year, IMO, yet people like to harp on a few games where they had issues while ignoring the rest.Huskers what the fuck. Hmm...maybe I should go read HuskerBoard.Wait, when did Bama have a thin RB depth chart recently?So, what do you think happens. Is Riley basically going to be coaching for his job next year, potentially being someone who will be fired mid-season if the bad continues?Wait, we're not just talking about open positions? Then no. UGA is NOT a top 5 job.

USC, ND, OSU, OU, Alabama, Texas, Penn State, Michigan all beat out UGA as far as job quality. 

The way I look at it is that UGA is a "top" job, but not a "premiere" job...or put another way not a "cream of the crop" job. All of the CFB bluebloods basically are better overall jobs, but that comes simply with the status of being such as well.

This isn't a slight on UGA, that's important to note. You don't just "become better" than blue blood positions.I've been watching this team a long time. My heart is conditioned, lol. That said, I'm probably on the road to about a 50-ish year life with this team, lol.&gt;OU potentially for recruiting base

Oklahoma borders Texas, which everyone should agree is a better and bigger recruiting state than Georgia by far..in part due to population and simply the quality of what Texas High School football is (not a knock on GA HS FB). They play a game every year that's one of the biggest rivalries in the country, too, literally AT the Texas State Fair. OU simply doesn't have the same recruiting base troubles that the other plains states' programs do, in large part because of that rivalry...and their past success.

&gt;Disagree on Penn State for many reasons

Here's some of my rationale on PSU...

Bigger and better stadium environment (as much as I want to go down to visit Sanford, it's no Beaver)

In that same vein: PSU's fanbase? They blow *most* programs out of the water, especially when it comes to game time at home.

Pennsylvania as a recruiting state is what I'd describe as "Georgia Light" almost (albeit not quite on the same level), and PSU have a better chance of keeping top recruits in-state because unlike Georgia they don't have too many national/regional powers bordering the state poaching that talent (At least a couple...FSU, Alabama, Clemson I think have all done VERY well in GA recently, and a few others).

I'm pretty sure PSU is well above UGA money-wise as an overall institution as well (endowment is something like double Georgia's, IIRC, but I could be way off). They simply have far more to work with when it comes to attracting the right staff, regardless of the recent issues.

&gt;You can. I think we've passed Nebraska and Tennessee, both of which would have been "blue bloods" considered far ahead of us only 10 years ago. 

Right, I'd say both of those programs haven't been truly top programs in the short term due to their own undulations, not necessarily anything UGA has specifically done to "elevate themselves above" those two names. For Tennessee at least, if both jobs opened up tomorrow, I can't see anything that would sway a neutral coach towards UGA specifically, or the other direction, really. And that's with Tennessee in its current state.

---

I'm sure there are other factors I'm not considering, and I'd gladly hear them.I mean, that's basically every ND TE ever.You're talking to the proud owner of a set of Vols checkered pants.SMU still has a pretty potent offense this year. I wouldn't be the least bit shocked if they hung around with Temple for a while....Oh my god, I actually remember this.&gt;penalties

[See my flair](http://www.footballsheology.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/penalty-flag.jpg)

&gt;turnovers

I'd say ND/ASU last year, everything that could go wrong DID when it came to turnovers. Same could apply to the Clemson game this year, perhaps, but that still wasn't as bad as ASU.

&gt;terrible overall play

ND/PITT 2012...until late in the game. They had no fucking clue what they were doing, at least one player, Louis Nix, had the flu, and it showed.

The Bama/ND NCG. Worst play all year, worse than they played against PITT. Lack of tackling, no desire to hit anything, whatever. This is still why a small fraction of my mind thinks that the rumor about them doing "no-contact practices" leading up to that NCG is True, but whatever. They weren't going to win, no, but could have been a little more competitive.

&gt;No fans show up

Pick a Miami game?

&gt;terrible overall play DUE TO A FUCKING TORNADO

ND/USF. Unfortunately family decided we HAD to take off and go home. So we drove the short ways back and got back in time to see most of the then-resumed second half.Nobody cares. It's the first fucking rankings. And FOX/FS1 has a direct investment with the B12, if he's complaining about them being left out. So there's a little bias there.I enjoyed seeing them attempt a Gameday show last year.Honestly, I don't remember.My football fandom was based upon my family's school decision. Does that count? :(At this point, I think the "FireRicht" crowd actually believes UGA is on par with Alabama, USC and OSU and that they should have Saban/Meyer/Carroll (or the next-coming)[...](https://media.giphy.com/media/4pMX5rJ4PYAEM/giphy.gif)

Arrogant Fanbase (although some of those were weeded out with Weis and Willingham)

Winning a lot in the past, and doing well recently

Parents' passed on their hate for a team they've never played, or hardly ever played. This one has always perplexed me.

Some past and current benefit from the big name, much like other blue bloods

The fact that they remain independent, which would be understandable if they used that power to schedule doormat teams.

Anti-Catholic sentiment (this is why we hate Michigan, in part)

All sorts of stuff...

edit: also, that one fuckin' guy.... /u/Drunken_WandererI got lazy.As a Vols fan too, this makes me sad.Come on now, the support showed for Lattimore was immense and clearly not what anyone wanted to happen.I dunno, I think there's....another team...that people were slightly more incensed about.I can't wrap my head around ND Football-only fans. I watch every sport I can for this institution. It's not that hard, because they're pretty goddamned (hue) good at everything, for the most part. And I try to read up on the place when I can...which I haven't done in a while, admittedly.&gt; NBC. Notre Dame has an entire channel that dedicates their college football coverage to their team. 

Uhh, I mean...they dedicate the 3.5 hours when a home game, specifically, is going on. So saying the "entire channel" isn't exactly accurate.

Also, they do show a couple Ivy League games each year, and they have Premiere League coverage as well on Saturdays.Nah, it's those three. ND/MSU/Vols. I "follow" others, but those three are the primary, in that order.There's a lot of that in Indiana, actually. ND Football/IU Basketball fans. I'm like...really?&gt;The fans are uppity.

This describes basically every sports fanbase.

&gt;They still aren't in a conference, officially. 

Which they usually use to schedule tougher and more intriguing regular season matchups, as they tend to highly value the regular season slate of play.


&gt; They have their own tv deal with nbc, subjecting us to a mandatory BC vs ND on national tv game that no one cares about, outside of those fan bases. 

TIL you're being forced to watch NBC. If they didn't have ND on NBC, they probably wouldn't have anyone in that slot anyway given ESPN's stranglehold on things.

&gt;They have so many rivalries i lose track of them. "Notre Dame vs Everyone Else" 

This is also because random fans have decided to hate ND because it's the popular thing to do.Nope, because BC isn't that big of a brand. People hate ND in part because it's the popular thing to do now, as I put in another post, much like becoming a Bernie Sanders supporter on Reddit.USF, yeah, they showed replays from another game. I'm not sure if that's a big deal or not. What else should they do with the programming time? Show the multicolored bars and long tone sound?&gt; Well, noob here, but from what I've seen Ohio State-Michigan is bar none the greatest rivalry in North American Sports.

Fun Fact: Did you know they call it *The Meteor Game*?[You had me at "hello".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHo)&gt;Look at some of their schedules under the Weis era. 

Weis Era schedules:

2005, 9-3: PITT, Michigan, MSU, Washington, Purdue, USC, BYU, Tennessee, Navy, Syracuse, Stanford, Bowl: OSU

2006, 10-3: GT, PSU, Michigan, MSU, Purdue, Stanford, UCLA, Navy, UNC, AF, Army, USC, Bowl: LSU

2007, 3-9: GT, PSU, Michigan, MSU, Purdue, UCLA, BC, USC, Navy, AF, Duke, Stanford

2008, 7-6: SDSU, Michigan, MSU, Purdue, Stanford, UNC, Washington, PITT, BC, Navy, Syracuse, USC, Bowl: Hawaii

2009, 6-6: Nevada, Michigan, MSU, Purdue, Washington, USC, BC, Wazzu, Navy, PITT, UCONN, Stanford

It's key to remember that some of these teams were not as good as they are now when ND played them, also some teams like PITT were far better back then. That being said, those aren't TERRIBLE slates at all.

Each featured at least 2 or more ranked teams at the time ND played them.GT doesn't qualify, but the other three are trophy games.Actually, it was Devine's idea. The movie lied.&gt;Definitely the blue bloods. But i think that ND fans carry themselves with a certain level of smug that is only rivaled by Michigan. 

First off, you're bringing your rival into it, that's a little transparent.

&gt;Yes, nbc might have non sports programming on instead of college football. Its still a nationally televised game every week. The cowboys of college football. 

Right, so...what's the problem? Let's be honest, "subjecting us" (your words) is a completely BS way to describe it. Outside of the primetime games on ESPN, most games they (ESPN) show are only really interesting to the fanbases of the two teams playing, too, unless you're obsessed with CFB like I am.

&gt;That and ND adds a trophy to almost any regular game they play. 

So, when was the last time ND added a trophy?I hate everything about these people you just described. I'm familiar with many of them.Uhh, I think Navy is better now than they once were....FYI. Call it a hunch.I'd love this. At this point, anything to piss people off.ND just played Northwestern last year, too, FYI. And ND has Purdue back again, too, soon.I would say UMASS is the joke game this year. They're probably the worst team ND has scheduled for quite some time, also given their only very recent jump to FBS.TIL Auburn is religion.Finishing with a potentially 10-1 Stanford at the end of the year helps put the icing on the cake, IF both teams survive until then.Still have to play PITT, Wake, and BC. And again...PITT.Careful, Juju might give you a lil' push.Dear Temple:

\u0ca0_\u0ca0 

That is all.Fucking imploding.I know I do."If SMU wins this they told their AD they're going to ....tear up the dressing room...so they better be ready to replace it?"

Did I hear that right?loool fake punt

edit: damn...someone is madYeah, they should probably do it against teams that have shown time and again that they fall for it. 

:([Angry guy in this thread.](http://i.imgur.com/csU1W.gif)And former RB Autry Denson is the RBs coach

And former CB Todd Lyght is the DBs coach

:pI fail to see a problem with this.

Other than losing to Bert.PITT can bench Tyler Boyd today, no reason to play him.

Trust me.Unhealthy Cook vs Healthy Watson? Watson.

Otherwise, I'd say both are as equally as important/as big a part of their offense.Booo.Good, now a G5 or lower P5 breakout player has to compete for his playing time with the NFL caliber guys already topping the blue bloods' depth chart. Maybe if there were a big position deficiency, but I don't see it happening quite the way you say.I mean...he "sat down" ND RB Folston, too. And TE Durham Smythe and QB Malik Zaire the next week.Haters, haters everywhere.Except Notre Dame. :(My Pick: Fuck PITT.Can we stop this created narrative "from spring practice", please?

Adams is the 3rd stringer, Kizer was the 2nd stringer.His name is Josh Anderson.The second I got comfortable...Notre Dame pulled a Notre Dame on me...again.I'm also pretty sure ND had the best backfield in the country going into the season (maybe even the best overall team before the injuries started to hit).

Folston (UVA game probably would have been a lot different with his pass blocking, and now the others have developed in that regard as well)

Prosise

Adams/Williams

It's absurd. Plus, obviously, the OL/TE blocking helped.Really good. It was....42-17 I think before the backups came in and some BS started happening, like a fumble.To be fair, it gets used a lot as an insult like Notre Lame, etc.And then the staff can recruit him again to stay next year.......

.....this is not the Clemson team I was looking for.MFW Smag is the guy throwing INTs, not Golson.FSU band is making this sound like it's in fucking Tally.He may have had a foot in, but he was right on the edge. Hard to say without watching again.Cmon Clemson.Sounds like you're watching a stream. :pWinning out, including a win over a potentially 10-1 Stanford, with a loss to Clemson sitting pretty at #1 is a good enough resume I think to put ND at 3 or 4. Whereas if they lose a game, that lessens the significance of the close loss.

Also bear in mind the REASON ND is so high right now is in part because of the close loss to Clemson. Everyone seems to be losing track of that.Join the club. It's beyond annoying.Still, the loss itself came on a fluky play.Any time you want to find that run defense, Clemson.If they lose at this point after the first week of the CFP rankings, then yes, I think it'll affect ND's stature (because again, that loss to #1 is a big reason why ND is up so high). If Clemson loses in the last couple games of the year, I think that'd help more, being further into the CFP rankings being released and further away from the ND/Clemson game. A LOT of this comes down to timing.

Out last 3 games are against Stanford and two currently 3-6 teams...it's not like we have a gauntlet ahead of us that's going to help solidify the case for a berth.All we need is Bama to lose to help bump ND into the top 4 for now.

I don't see any B12 team getting above ND until the final weeks of the regular season (and if OU wins out, they certainly aren't getting above ND). And, even then, with Baylor's new QB they look a bit vulnerable, and their SOS isn't good enough to necessarily place them ABOVE ND even if they win out.

Alabama is above ND right now, and them losing to LSU tonight will bump ND up, putting Bama completely out of contention. OSU has both MSU and UM left on the schedule, too, and I don't see them getting through both.

Frankly, I think with those two out of the picture (OSU and Bama), if ND wins out, that makes the final CFP bracket Clemson, LSU, ND, Baylor/TCU/OkSt. (and right now TCU is on the ropes)

Clemson losing however devalues ND's loss, which can mean that ND gets penalized with a currently undefeated Baylor team right behind them.Scrappy Doo!If Clemson loses this game, FSU is most likely in the ACCCG, not Clemson.

I just disagree. Simply put, we want Clemson to win out. I don't think any B12 team gets out alive. I think each of them may have a loss, and Baylor going undefeated has a weak enough schedule that I don't believe they bump ND out. It may be a shitshow if that comes to pass, but that's the way it is.Oh Clemson.

edit: lol wow, you guys are mad.[YOU HEAR THAT?!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHo)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHo

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHoYou must not be familiar with Notre Dame Football. :pThis better stop being fucking ridiculous right now.Oh man...here we goooooo. One of my favorite games of the year, every year.Have they done that before? Never heard it.Probably not going to be very much scoring and "slow paced" with all the running, clock winding a lot of time...if I had to guess.So, a barnburner."The contrasting emotion from Nick Saban"

*shows Nick Saban with zero emotion*Maybe because it's a little predictable?That people should stop creating offseason posts in the middle of one of the biggest Saturdays of the year.Well, ABC is for broadcast, perhaps they're assuming that people watching on ABC may not have the biggest screens?arrgh.They already did today. I think they're full.&gt;this could be 2012 all over again

I'd prefer a slightly different ending.I mean, I wouldn't mind this, I don't think.&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Navy
Navy's going 11-1 this year. I'm not kidding. Yes, I think they beat Houston, too.&lt;3[:(](http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Supernatural-Dean.gif)Their front 7 is simply better. It's painful to watch.I thought the same thing. But frankly, your problem is run blocking against Bama's extremely good defensive front. They're just too good for your OL to handle. Think about it, LSU hasn't played anyone this year that has remotely THIS good of a defensive front (UF's strength is their secondary). And that's why the LF7 run game as been so amazing this year.This is fucking stupid. Look, if your strength (by a large degree) is your run game, you HAVE to use the pass to set it up. ESPECIALLY AGAINST a front 7 like Bama's. 

LSU, your OC sucks balls if he doesn't realize this.Clearly fucking OB on his own. This is stupid if they don't overturn it.#WHAT?! FUCK YOU! Yes, yes they did. :(Anything to praise Bama. :pPassed out, in LSU fashion.This...reminds me of a game.[LSU highlights vs Bama](http://www.nopenopenopenopenopenope.com)I mean....to be fair....they tend to deliver when they're in the championship game, no matter who they play.Ohhburn.jpg[Here, LSU fans, you'll need this.](http://i.imgur.com/IF9i05s.jpg)Don't play it in the Sugar Bowl?Sadly, I can't handle shots anymore. I think it's a reflex issue. Than again, it's kinda nice not being able to ruin myself.It's the fact that this is the best front 7 LSU has played all year, not really LF7. LSU hasn't played any truly great front 7 up until this point, so that's why he put up some monster numbers, coupled with the fact that he's amazing when they open the right holes...which the line hasn't been able to do all night.*drags self across field*

That shit was hard to watch.FYI, this isn't JUST LSU's lack of an ability to run block Bama's front 7, it's also LSU's play calling trying to force the run, when they should be using the pass to set it up.QB is the least of their problems right now. It's the OL and playcalling.Obviously not all the time. However it spreads the front 7 out more, which gives the OL a bit of room to create space rather than running into the brick wall that is Bama's front 7 literally every play.LSU players celebrating seem to forget that means they have to play Bama's defense again.Problem is, at least Bama has shown they can deliver in the big bowls.There's no way LSU comes back.

There's no way LSU comes back.

There's no way LSU comes back.

Pls come back.lol good point.As opposed to...?This shit was so boring Verne thought he was at Round 1 of The Masters.Welcome to my CFB philosophy. I said that shit before MSU got that puntblockreturn.Cyrus, you should probably turn around if you want to get away with it.Blocked XP sets us up perfectly for OT with two more LSU TDs.

Just sayin...

:3Welcome to The Alabama Football TeamEvil placed.Ahh waiter! I'll have one turnover, please.LSU gave people hope....those bastards.Gary trying to jinx them into a fumble.They lost the minute their OL stepped on the field.Clemson and Bama make it. I don't think OSU makes it through one of MSU or UM, even after that MSU loss. :/

Also, there is another team still in the hunt...*cough*I think Iowa is in a situation like OSU was last year with the weakened schedule argument. If you run through undefeated for the regular season, and then win the CCG, that will get you the spot. It's only going to be the 2nd rankings. They literally don't matter.Also Iowa is still there, too.I'm almost positive the B12 will. I also still think ND has hope over an undefeated Baylor. Their schedule overall, backloaded or not, just isn't good. That said, I'm doubting that they'll be able to complete the season without a loss, anyway. OU next game may be able to really give them fits.*chuckles*It's Clemson, seriously.Before we inevitably drop a game to Wake or BC.This belongs more in the GIF/Video/Vine thread at the top....rather than a full thread.And ND actually just helped their case, too, while Baylor struggled mightily against KSU. That said, it was Stidham's first game as a starter and it was away. It'll be interesting to see how they handle OU at home next week.While that's True, it was literally the first game of the year. Stanford looks like a COMPLETELY different team right now on the field, which is why watching the games is important.I don't think it's quite as bad as you're making it seem, almost like Iowa has NO chance. But I do think Stanford looks like the stronger team at this point in time.You seem awfully sure that Stanford is going to lose to Oregon, in Palo Alto.


Also, using the NW outcomes is pointless, IMO, as I said elsewhere. It was their first game of the season. They are a very different team now. You seem to be holding onto the NW game an awful lot.You realize that's a Clemson tradition, right? It's normal for them. It's called "Meet at The Paw", IIRC.Swap out Baylor...after that performance against KSU? Really? OkSt I'd understand a bit more.It's called "drawing a parallel", which is that since that early season loss the team had recovered and looks MUCH better...just like OSU recovered their season, too.I have never seen this. It's great. I want one with Kizer. :(Off the top of my head at this hour, I couldn't remember if it was only home wins or not.It seems someone is mad about this in this thread, lol.You guys like cherry picking games (Northwestern and Wazzu, which was played in terrible conditions) as the basis for your entire argument.

Sure, let's forget their UCLA, Colorado, Washington, Arizona, and USC performances. You know, roughly half the season.

Now, where have I seen this before...Iowa fans seemingly hitting anyone who says anything that disagrees.Ugh, I miss the days as a kid where ND would let you on the field after the spring Blue and Gold game.Bama is probably going to manhandle them.Point: complain about Bama.

/pointThey got manhandled last year @Bama and MissSt had a FAR better team. This Bama front 7 will most likely (not for sure) eat them alive. They'll have to get the ball out of his hands extremely fast and about the only dude that's potentially a mismatch on any of Bama's DBs is Da'Runnya.

I get it's in Stark, but Bama's no stranger to away games.Yeah, that's True. I just doubt that down the stretch they go back to those old ways, that's all. With the team we saw tonight, it's hard to see many chinks in the armor right now...which is also in part due to LSU's shitty OL play....and MissSt replaced a fair number of their OL, too, IIRC between last and this season.I feel bad for saying it like I did. It's just...Bama's front 7 is looking THAT good.Oh I totally watched it. I just meant that...I wasn't necessarily being nice about it. I forgot you were down to #3 at LT, though. Damn. I knew it was bad, though, even before the year started, with 3-4 being gone on the OL IIRC.Army actually looked much more impressive last year than in recent seasons against Navy. I wouldn't necessarily be THAT shocked. Then again, I think this Navy team with the way Reynolds is playing right now rolls 11-1, as I don't see much stopping them.

Also, yeah, they said they would hold of the announcements if either team are in the running until afterward.Honestly, right now I have Navy beating Houston...perhaps even somewhat comfortably.It's like Home Alone, with cats.You don't know ND like I do. :(

It may not happen, but it's not exactly unlikely.I love the video, but probably not the best title or really a reason to post this video in its own separate thread.They...don't necessarily just do that for the SEC...they also prop up other...major programs when there's even the slightest justification.I know it's their job, but to be fair, if you've been commentating CFB for a long time...you've seen some shit.It's like playing Purdue who shows up for major games all the goddamned time.This must be your first rodeo if you think this year is an anomaly. There's a reason why you should watch everything you can, including the late night games.I, too, was angry the last time my team played Bama and looked as bad (worse really) as LSU did tonight.It's hard not to love Riley, though.Yeah, until the next CFP release on Tuesday. Anything you can do you continue taking the heat off ND. So, Bama #1 just because, pls.This is....exactly the reaction I have. Let's just move the fuck on.
OU's loss was mid-season, and to 4-5 Texas. Theirs was first game of the year....to 7-2 Northwestern. Massive difference.Didn't work out for them so well last time, 20-6 IIRC.GO GRIZZ!

Also, I wonder if that dude was down though when he recovered it.I mean...ND and UM haven't met every year. There have been 42 total meetings, IIRC.To be fair, stat rankings don't mean everything.No, fuck YOU! Wait...what?No.&gt;It was our second conference game, and since we've bounced back more than Stanford has in that we've outscored every opponent by at least 30 points. 

You've "bounced back more than Stanford" against who exactly? KSU, TTU, Kansas, and ISU? Not a single one of those teams has a winning record, right? (the best being I think TTU at 5-5) The only game Stanford struggled with is Wazzu (and up in Pullman), and they're 6-3 right now. Outside of that, they've soundly beaten better overall teams, including handing UCLA one of their only two losses in dominant fashion.

&gt;I liked Northwestern, they were my pick to win the B1G after the Minnesota game. They have not looked good since then. How does that weigh into the Stanford loss? Do we ignore how the teams finish or do we only look at losses based on the teams at the time of the game?

You're asking if we ignore how the teams finish. Great question. Do we ignore how Stanford is finishing? :pSorry, all I heard was "I've been wrong 1,000 times."

At least you're finally admitting it. :pI can't even begin to understand Baylor being ahead of OkSt or ND right now, especially given their recent result against KSU. I swear to you, I'm not attacking Baylor just as part of "hating Baylor", it just doesn't make sense.I found someone who didn't watch the game.I'm not even surprised. Followed the dude's recruiting the whole way. Sucks ND couldn't pull him, especially since we apparently need all the RBs we can get this year.Doesn't really matter anymore since everyone is now using the CFP rankings, even ESPN, etc.I think Stanford would still beat them, if we're just talking PAC12.It's because /r/CFB is now in the "Acceptance" stage.Fair enough.

I'd say the Stanford Football comes with the packages they run, stuff we really didn't see as much earlier on in the year, especially when McCaffrey was more of an unknown commodity.This would completely fuck ND's SOS overnight, no offense to the AAC.It's not easy playing great front 7s, especially when your OL is melted swiss cheese, like LSU's.And awaaaay we gooo! Welcome to this week's first "F the SEC" post!This guys posts in here a fair amount, so he is doing this for...whatever reason...And they were all created by A&amp;M.&gt; Do people really have nothing better to do than to bitch about such inconsequential things like this? 

To answer your question, yes. Plenty of people, on /r/CFB included, spend their time just talking shit and/or finding things that have happened to programs in the past just to offend.And they do an excellent job at it, too.Nice try, Cougar. You can't BEER your way into a conference!

^^^Can ^^^you?Yeah, it was immaculate even with the conditions.&gt;**Temple better program than cincy** in a bigger market.

I don't think you understand how this works. Temple is having a GREAT year. But, one single good year doesn't automatically propel one's *program* ahead of others. Also consider the work Cincy is putting in right now to their program, like major additions to Nippert. Temple doesn't even currently have their own stadium.To be fair, that's a decade ago...which is a long time. That said, your point stands.Did...did he actually ask if the SEC would add them?Even if the VT line is True, you do understand Temple doesn't hold a birthday candle to VT, right?

And also, the SEC? They're not fucking adding Temple. That would be a joke of an addition beyond imaginable.It's clear you don't understand the difference between "potentially beating a team one year" and "overall program status". I'm guessing you're really young at this point.I'm beginning to wonder if this dude is a PSU (or other) fan in disguise. No Temple fan has been this...over the top uneducated on the CFB landscape.Yes! I was waiting for this one! Never went there, never claimed to.Two can play this game. I was born into an ND family, been doing this all my life...including the shitty years with Willingham, Weis, Faust, etc.. It chose me, I didn't choose it...you know, like you chose to go to Temple.I also have grads in the family too, and all the family friends that come with it. It's crazy, really.Stanford and USC can play them after their stop-over in South Bend. WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING THE OWLS, PAC12?!It's a common line whenever going after ND fans. Ah well.I've been trying to tell you that Baylor sucks for so long. Maybe now you'll finally listen. /sActually, yeah. ND shows any big plays on the WatchND channel's full game highlights, ND or not. Honestly, though, I think that isn't something everyone does. ND tends to do what they can to show respect to their opponents.Not Notre Dame, amirite?Aww it got removed.This is a little out of character for you (with all the strategy discussions and whatnot), and I love it.Hah. Should probably pick a school that exists next time.No, they're terrible.I...don't think there's that many games against Pac12 opponents in the last few seasons...but...thank you?Nobody would be favored over Bama right now...in part thanks to that performance against LSU.[Tigger](#i/tigger) **"I disagree!"**Must...make....grades....and then cry.&gt;Si.

ftfyGets me every time.&gt;Vegas knows WAY more about football than the AP or the CFP committee.

I'm going to have to disagree here. Vegas bets based almost entirely on numbers, and not on watching teams in question, etc.

&gt; Doesn't mean they're always right, but they are right more often than anyone else. 

Gonna need proof of this, and who is "anyone else"?

&gt;Also, clemson is one of the only teams that can beat Bama. Bama has a great run defense. But their pass D is merely good. And they struggle with QBs who can run. Clemson in some ways is the perfect team to beat Bama. Doesn't mean they will. 

Right, but an important aspect of Clemson's offense "passing" is the short passes (especially with Williams out), screens/end arounds with Scott, etc. And now with a healthy Watson, QB runs. Bama's D is good enough up front that they could potentially wreak havoc on these short plays Clemson runs a lot of, that typically end up going for more yards because of their playmakers' abilities. And they'd probably be capable of pretty much taking Gallman out of the run game, given their front 7 vs Clemson's OL would probably be very rough for Clemson. Although Gallman I believe is a better "receiver out of the backfield" than Fournette in that one aspect of the game, so that could chance things. If Williams were there, it would probably change a LOT. That said, along the sidelines, etc. Renfrow has become a good target, though not sure how he'd handle some of Bama's defenders. Minkah (as I think he's at Safety or STAR, now, ?) alone could probably take out a lot of their throws over the middle like to Leggett, etc.

It's all about matchups and how one unit relates to the opposing team's.Really? Every CFB/NFL football discussion I've seen boils down to stats and stat rankings. I've never seen Vegas discussions deal with unit vs unit and star player comparisons, etc.Both. I know a few and while they know a fair amount, they're not exactly studying the game like coaches, etc. might be. Maybe they're not doing so well, then, and don't let that slip. *shrugs*[OneHourFootball on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/OneHourFootball)Fair enough. Yeah, I agree with all of that...I've never been able to wrap my head around using stats as the entire basis for anyone's argument. This is why I tend to watch....a LOT of games.&gt;ITT : Most pretend Internet points I've seen anyone lose in one thread.

lolThat hadn't played a single great front 7 all year. Who have they played defensively that holds a candle to Bama's front 7? Nobody.*breathes in deeply*

Ahhhh Georgia fans.If Rhule sticks and manages to have another great year in 2016, I think he's going to be poached. In no way is Temple going to be able to hold onto a coach like that, especially if he shows consistent ability to deliver  great success at a program like Temple's. On top of that, he seems to be a great face for a football program.Well, yeah. The phrase "winning fixes everything" didn't come from nowhere.Yeah. I wanted to say that "he'll be gone this year" absolutely, but thought that it was important to leave the window open for him sticking for another year.Serious off-topic question: What are you doing living in central ND (have you lived there for a long time, or was it a job)?What.Hmm, apparently not.Stanford did the same to Oregon a couple times, IIRC.Unless of course their entire offense consists of double passes and throwing to whoever KeiVarae is covering...or running right at Joe Schmidt.To be fair, these aren't the cursed Green Jerseys. These are completely new.Damn that's awesome they get to do that.[Goodbye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjngVjypbbA)[I don't uh...I don't care for Auburn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m6Sw26gUQo)Don't forget "why is Bama/ND in the top 4?" which we'll inevitably have more of soon.Well, you ARE a Baylor fan.


^^^/sTemple fans probably saw the Aggie post and didn't bother. /u/unbn was the Ag that spent most of his time calling the dude out on his BS and trying to explain to people that not all of them are nuts, rightfully so and is an overall good guy, too.I can't admire a season that was cancelled immediately after AppState beat Michigan.&gt;Those are all amazing plays, but we still have 6 unbeaten teams

B12 still has to go through their little round robin or whatever scenario.

OU could go a long way to help ND get into the CFP, so...you know...BOOMER!I'm old enough to realize that there will always be that "pull" to the area in which you grew up, at least that's been the way I've seen it. That's just part of who we are.

I bet it sucks for CFB, but I've heard that NDSU and Montana are some great environments (although they're somewhat further away from each other, given the state size of Montana and ND), so hopefully you've gotten a chance, or will have, to go to those. They're two on my list actually.

Another small plus is the star viewing has to be pretty amazing just a short ways outside of most towns up that way. :pI mean, OSU being beaten by UM probably would help ND get into the CFP. I don't, however, see all of this propelling UM into the CFP. Shoot, they'd probably throw in an 11-1 B12 "Co-champ" before UM.11-1 ND, too, just in my (albeit biased) opinion. Then again, that would mean Stanford would be 11-2.Undefeated at 13-0? Yes, there is a way they'd get in over you. Honestly, this is the scenario where the G5 finally gets in over a Conference Champ, who would be 11-2. Frankly, though, I have Navy beating Houston right now.Nice. Yeah, I get the light pollution helps a bit with the possible seasonal disorders. Similar stuff like what you might see in Alaska, etc.

What was your degree in, if I might ask?Even though I don't necessarily buy OP's scenario, YES...IMO, Michigan is a massive difference in revenue, etc. compared to a school like Houston.You're disregarding a 1-loss Navy team that just beat Memphis, somewhat handily, I might add.Oh nice! Yeah, I figured it was something like that.

Does this mean you deal with stuff like hydraulic fracturing as well?If you don't think Navy is a strong team, then you must be a team that doesn't play Navy. Reynolds is bar none the best rushing QB in the country. It's damn near impossible to defend such a soundly executed offense, and everyone is finding that out this year.

edit: I may have misread what he meant, and this could have just been an error omissionPoor Clemson and all their recent success. :pThat's fair, I guess I misread what you meant.That is what I meant, but I also think I misread what he said. It was more an error of omission, not intentionally him saying Navy was bad.Ahh yes, the old "tough opponent before the Iron Bowl" game.

*runs*Yeah but what were they when you put them on the schedule?! :p

*still running*

&lt;3Guess they didn't see the Bama game.

*drives off*

Sorry, I'm in a mood right now. Dude's amazing.I blv this was posted earlier today somewhere.&gt;They utterly dominated Texas and WVU, and solidly beat an Iowa State team that dominated Texas. 

There's another team that completely dominated Texas, too...seems people might be forgetting this. Just thought I'd point that out, that's all.Not saying anything either way, but, let's just look at overall resume of opponents both teams have beaten for comparison between ND and OkSt.

---

**Current W/L of ND's wins (so I'm not counting Clemson):**

Texas 4-5

UVA 3-6

GT 3-6

UMASS 1-8

Navy 7-1

USC 6-3

Temple 8-1

PITT 6-3

**Overall W/L of opponents ND has beaten: 37-33**

---

**Current W/L of OkSt's wins:**

CMU 5-4

Central Arkansas (FCS) 6-3

UTSA 1-8

Texas 4-5

KSU 3-5

WVU 4-4

Kansas 0-9

TTU 5-5

TCU 8-1

**Overall W/L of opponents OkSt has beaten: 36-44 (one being FCS, if we remove the FCS opponent which makes the number of opponents beaten the same, your Opp W/L comes out to 30-41)**

---

Also, there's a mutual opponent in Texas. And ND destroyed them while OkSt struggled with them. Granted, OkSt had to play them @DKR.

*If I didn't add those numbers right, please let me know.*Didn't have enough timeouts to prevent another FG. :(

Also, TCU "let them score" too, a TD even! Boo TCU! :pFair enough. I just don't think you can boil everything down to one single game, which is what seems to be going on here. That's all I'm saying.\u0ca0_\u0ca0&gt;You\u2019re getting a chance to establish relationships with his contacts and it\u2019s not what you know it\u2019s who you know. That was fantastic, their development of the man.

This sounds exactly like the old Notre Dame sell.

And Urbie? :|They didn't lose to PITT, and actually looked convincing doing it.Prosise played until he got injured.

And then Adams got to almost 150 yards. :|Step 1: Blitz

Step 2: What the fuck is press coverage?Simple. Move the university out of the state of Missouri. **/SSS**Might be a little easier now that the "why is Bama in the top 4?" and "Baylor's SOS is shit" threads have finally stopped.


...until the CFP rankings come out tomorrow night.Yeah, I edited, lol.I still couldn't believe what I was watching that whole game.I love that the mascot came and hugged him too.[The ending of ND/UVA has pretty much everything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsFgAGJxGuM) *pat pat*

[2014 ND/Stanford Golson to Koyack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDUvS88s_cY)

But, as the top comment says...that Fiesta Bowl ending takes the cake.You guys will (should) probably end up taking Baylor's spot at 5/6 with ND moving up into the top 4 behind Bama.I was thinking of putting exactly those two images in my post.Trees suck anyway.&gt;McMurphy: LSU vs. Notre Dame

Uhoh, rematch time.No.Another possibility is that both ND and OU win out.

Who gets the nod, then?Drunk driving problems? Come to OSU! ^^^/s

Welp, now we've got that out of the way.Bilbo MyerSounds good. We meet on Tuesday.Dammit, I laughed.&gt; Jacksonville Jags

The team Bama could beat? No way.Also, I find it interesting that UM would be ranked at 5th with their losses to Utah and MSU, yet ND is that far below them....with losses to two of his teams actually in the CFP. I get this would mean a win over OSU, etc. but the losses have to count for something.Swimming in all those coins would be painful.First I'm hearing of love for Bill Snyder on /r/CFB.Dude's probably retiring again now that things are getting rough, so I wouldn't count on it.http://i.imgur.com/IlTA2pn.gifWell if he grabs a few more supplements, lifting those games shouldn't be a problem.SumlinSumlinLeave it to Baylor to ruin things. :pSumlinSumlin.http://i.imgur.com/cEFmba0.gifSumlinSumlin.[*"Roadhouse."*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2nciV2Q7M)Ahh yes, one game and Fournette is out. Makes perfect sense.Silly goose, you know you get Richt 4 Life. #DontWantBama

Also, that CFP IS entirely possible.I would be the biggest LSU fan.Frankly, I still maintain that most of what's taken place at A&amp;M is directly because of JFF being such a "Surprise" that led to their couple years of great success with him. I'm not convinced he'll ever be able to deliver A&amp;M to the SECCG with Bama and LSU being somewhat permanent roadblocks.&gt;Johnny

Uhh, JFF was Class of 2011 and committed in 2010. Sumlin didn't even bring him to A&amp;M, if that's right. JFF made crazy plays himself with his feet, that's not coached and teams were completely unprepared for him. Almost all of the other stuff could also be attributed to how exciting JFF was to watch and also his Heisman run, which brought the hype to A&amp;M's program.

I agree next year is the year to prove whether or not he's legit, it's just right now I have trouble buying that it will happen or that Sumlin is the main reason for everything that's happened.It's completely idiotic. His line did him ZERO favors that game, similar to ND's line vs Clemson's for Prosise...part of this for ND also being the loss of their best blocker at TE for that game. Not sure if LSU had injuries up front for Bama, though.Honestly, I still think there's a difference between an undefeated P5 Champ with a win in a CCG and an undefeated B12 Champ, though. This is especially True if it's Baylor's current overall SOS.Yeah, they show it in the Ducktales intro.Yeah, I mean...MSU just  isn't a CFP caliber team this year, potentially not even a Top 10 team, probably 10-15.Debatable.Yes it is. You suck, friend.I think it depends on WHICH undefeated B12 team it is. I think with Baylor they may end up being penalized for their overall SOS, regardless of the late season backloading. That's all I'm saying. They already were penalized for it by being put behind ND anyway in the initial CFP rankings. OkSt actually could (probably should at this point) end up being ahead of them tomorrow night, given their performance against TCU compared with Baylor's against KSU. #FuckBama?It's mine.Huh, had no idea. That shit makes a huge difference in the run game, especially when bouncing him to the outside.While cruising through the first 3/4 of the season playing nobody. At some point the rest of the schedule has to matter. Otherwise you're just saying "play whoever you want so long as you play a couple good ones late in the year" to everyone, and the committee has already said they value OOC games, overall resume, and SOS pretty highly.I literally just claimed it. "It's mine" is adult "dibs".&gt;The titles clearly indicate what the threads are about... 

...except "Sumlin".I wonder what team you'd like to see them add...

:pI agree it would be hard to argue, but that's when you start looking at everything overall and not just a sample of a couple games, which is why THINK there's a SLIM chance ND could get in over a 12-0 B12 team with a worse SOS. OU winning out seals the deal for ND, really, especially given their loss to a team ND beat handily.[Life is like a hurricane...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koSl8JX5BeI)You're the Emperor of a damn color, you don't know anything!I doubt it.&gt; in that weather

AH-**HA!!!** YOU'RE USING THE WEATHER TOO!!! FINALLY CAUGHT!!!

:p

You do not want to play that front 7. I'm praying even with ND's OL that if we win out we somehow dodge Bama. Although our pass pro has been amazing all year, even most of the Clemson game, really, I think they'd still have a field day.Seriously, what was it...like 5 turnovers?Frankly, you should probably want them in the 1st round. Playing them in the actual NCG has been bad for every team they've seen there.Better not fucking lose to Bert.Indeed. I forgot that the CFP wasn't there this year and almost put "pray it's in the Sugar Bowl' above.That was just Sugar Bowl magic. :pMaybe Alabama just won't come back for the second half.That's pretty much how I feel. ND rolls undefeated against their schedule any year, they are in. If they don't...then they are praying at 11-1 for someone else to lose..kinda like we're doing right now. But, the schedule helps give ND a leg-up to a degree at 11-1.Also ND beat USC convincingly, who beat the crap out of Utah literally the following week.I was specifically referencing his "don't lose to Clemson" comment. If ND loses, or any other team loses to anybody for that matter, then you have now given the CFP committee a reason to keep you out. I'm pretty sure UF is already locked in for the East in the SECCG, which is what he was referring to.&gt;In other words, if we lose a game, I think we have a much, much better shot of getting into the CFP if we are in a conference than not. At this point, we would still control our own destiny and would be on the road toward a rematch with Clemson in the ACC CCG. A win there and I think we're in..

Uhh, nothing I said would disagree with this, I don't think anyway. I wasn't taking "being into the ACC" even into account.No thank you. We had zero clue what tackling even was. They'd have won either way, but it was fucking absurd.&gt;I know last year Bama got a bump from the "game control" metric, whatever that may be.

They'll always have someone using the phrase "found a way to win" in some context or another, too.&gt;Also, drink water. Sometimes late November can still mean temperatures in the 90's and some people forget that water is important despite it being "fall/winter".

Can confirm, forgot to drink water last year. Not the best time, though didn't get sick just felt generally bad. Still hit around 85+ IIRC for the game. Also remember, just because it's cool in the morning doesn't mean it'll be a cooler day, it was 50 or so around 8am on gameday last year.What? No. With all the nutritional advice and player development in HS and earlier, the athletic pool is getting ever bigger year after year, not smaller. This is also in-part what contributes to the higher levels of parity we're seeing across the CFB landscape as a whole, and why we're seeing more and more "ready to play" freshmen walking into the bigger programs.*fires up the chainsaw*

I'm comin' for you TREE!"I'm not dead yet. I think I'll go for a ~~walk~~ field goal block return."Wait, so if I'm getting this right, they're changing what just worked this past weekend? Or they mean this is a continuation of what worked?

Maybe I'm just reading the article wrong.That's...frightening.Sorry if this was already posted....I looked on the front and recent posts and didn't find it.I missed that....

&gt;Georgia\u2019s total passing yards has decreased each week since throwing for 279 against Tennessee on October 10 (178 yards vs. Missouri, 154 yards vs. Florida, 90 yards vs. Kentucky).

Holy shit.This is great.That's...wow, that would kinda suck. Just say nothing at all, at that point.I was waiting for the Floyd response. Took long enough for one of the randoms that hardly/if ever posts on /r/CFB to show up.

His didn't happen during the middle of the year and he was suspended from all of spring practice, being reinstated in August (so basically a suspension of 4 months), if you actually read the article you linked. I don't necessarily agree with it, especially given his past offenses, and think it could very well have been time to part ways after the multiple issues.

On top of that, as was also covered in the article you linked, he made some changes:

&gt;said he has been to counseling, has changed his circle of friends and will stay in a residence hall instead of moving off campus.I'm going to have the bring the Guinness, as it's required drinking for ND Gamedays for myself.Anyone need anything else?!&gt;It also really hurts that the team doesn't really have a great deep threat anymore which takes away Cardale's greatest strength.

Throwing inaccurate long balls to receivers who have to bail him out?

Please, please no.&gt;Every ND opponent...a trap game if there ever was oneEhhh...maybe maybe not. 13-0 with wins over Memphis and Navy both to end the year, and whoever you play in the AACCG would be impressive enough to *POTENTIALLY* put you in the CFP. That said, I'm REALLY convinced that Navy is going 11-1 this year (not counting the AACCG), which would include beating Houston.Ships. This is the Navy we're talking about.Wait...dude what the hell was the bet that you lost?I feel like Idaho regularly fills this role.Yeah, I get that they "Want more respect" right now in the polls, but as long as they keep winning and win the B1GCG, they get in.~~11-1~~ 10-1 (because they had the McNeese St game cancelled) LSU wouldn't get in over 13-0 Iowa. There is zero chance of that happening.This has been known for a while. It's not a new announcement.This has to stop. Make a joke or whatever in an existing thread, but creating new posts almost every FUCKING day about it is absurd. This continues and I'm actually going to find myself defending them with facts and rational arguments, and I really don't want that.

I swear to fucking god if they lose, we better not have like 20 "see what happens when they finally play a real team?!" posts. But, alas, I already know we will.Yes, great joke.Hey man, might not want to throw too many stones. ND played their first 4 games against teams that don't have a winning record (Texas, UVA, GT, UMass), too. And out of the last 3 opponents, currently, BC is 3-7 and Wake is 3-6.When you lose, you allow people to be more critical of your resume. ND lost. Period.You think the way ND looked against Clemson looked better than the way Iowa looked against Northwestern?Alabama looked ridiculously impressive against an LSU team that was at the top of the rankings, against what could ultimately be the Heisman winner. They looked so dominant in that game that there isn't a single team that I would want to have to play them right now.Yeah, those offenses are deadly. Your main hope is to run clock while on offense keeping your defense from getting gassed/beaten by being out on the field play after play, series after series.We'd just throw in EQ. The last thing I'm worried about is WR depth at ND right now, save for Fuller.That sucks, man. Hope the rest of his life works out for him, though.Fucking Charlie Weis.And lately it really has been competitive, in part thanks to some down years, though, too. But, also Navy's emergence.For me, it's a nice lead-in to the MAC games starting at 8pm. Last week, and many weekdays, I feel asleep though while that was going on, lack of sleep and all during the night.Yes.&gt;2006 Ohio State.  2012 Notre Dame.  2014 Florida State.

&gt;In all three seasons, the undefeated (and untested) teams were obliterated in the post season.  Get ready to add another name to that list: 2015 Clemson.

&gt;untested

\u0ca0_\u0ca0

I love how hindsight grants people the luxury of calling every opponent you played during the regular season a joke.

2006 OSU

In 2006, OSU beat multiple ranked teams, including a #2 Texas that ultimately ended up at #13. And they beat them soundly. AT DKR, I might add. They played a PSU team at home that ended the season ranked as well. And their final regular season game was against then-#2 ranked UM.

---

2012 ND

In 2012, ND went @Oklahoma and handled them with relative ease, even with the game being close going into the 4th, there was never a time where ND was truly in danger of getting behind (may have led the whole game, save for being tied 13-13 IIRC after a Blake Bell almost-TD, but I can't be positive in my head anymore). They played an awesome Stanford team at home...who ended up in the Rose Bowl beating Wisconsin after beating UCLA for the PAC12 Championship. Regardless of what you think about the ending of that game, even IF after their 4 attempts or whatever to get into the endzone...it only would have gone to another OT provided they kicked the XP. 10/12 teams ND played that year were bowl eligible, BC and Wake being the two that were not. Also, ND ended up playing what might have been the best of all three Bama NC teams, and they were insanely ready to play that game. It's not like ND was the only one to get blown out by Bama in a NCG. This is a pattern when they get there with all three they've been in during their run.

---

2014 FSU

This team was tested plenty of times, in part because their team and Jameis had a bounty on his head, figuratively. They played multiple ranked teams as well,  including a Top 5 ND squad prior to all the injuries that killed the season. They beat a top 15 GT team in the ACCG before GT went out to trounce MissSt (one of the "top" SEC teams last year) in the Orange Bowl. And, they were taken to OT by a great Clemson squad (and their defense) that ultimately ended up in the top 15, going on to absolutely murder OU in the Russell Athletic Bowl.I've always conceded that 2/4 of the turnovers were perfect plays by Clemson, period. You can talk about some others, but you can't take two of them away. The helmet on the ball by the kicker is probably the play I'll remember most. It was just heads up by the kicker to go after him like that.

&gt; Notre Dame players didn't just literally drop the ball unaided.

Brown's fumble inside the 5 was mostly because he stretched for more when he should have just gone down. Corey's drop was more of just his hands "not working" than the defender doing anything to knock it loose (he hadn't been targeted all that much all year, so this is in part why IMO). Still, defensively overall, it was clear that Clemson came to play, especially up front until our OL finally got their act together.

&gt;Ball control is part of the game.

And therein lies the issue, bottom line, ND didn't protect the ball as well as they should have, ESPECIALLY with the one inside the 5 that was just a silly mistake trying to do too much. Clemson deserved the win more and they absolutely came out and punched ND in the mouth early.

&gt;monsoon

That narrative is just tiring at this point. Both teams played in it.Shit like this is why I'm surprised we were able to handle PITT with relative ease. They're usually a bitch and a half.

Also See: Purdue.There's also a ton of different vairations of Southern accents as well, Appalachians, Louisiana, etc.Yeah that's...what I thought, too. :(I've never actually said "that belongs on /r/punchablefaces" before. Until now.It's when those teams aren't very good where they usually become even more challenging. It makes zero fucking sense.I...what?1. Clemson

2. OSU

3. Bama

4. ND

5. OkSt

6. Baylor

Next out: 7/8: Stanford/Iowa (Stanford looked very impressive against Colorado while Iowa struggled with IU, which I think will allow them an excuse to keep undefeated Iowa lower for now. This is a similar reason as to why I see them placing OkSt above Baylor, looking more impressive against TCU than Baylor did @KSU.)

Frankly, it's possible they swap up OSU and Bama, given Bama's performance against LSU. I think unfortunately for the B12, the ND name moves them up into the 4th spot for now.Nah, I'm good.The one that cracked the streak was 2007.[MRW I get back on /r/CFB after a couple hours off and see yet another Bama post](http://i.imgur.com/LmkKn.gif)So the other 100 were okay?First play I think of every time I think about "catch of the year".I rode the bench for two years. Thought I wasn't being played because of my color, I got filled up with a lotta attitude. So I quit. Still not a week goes by I don't regret it. And I guarantee a week won't go by in your life you won't regret walking out, letting them get the best of ya. Now you hear me clear enough? Lucky for UF and UGA it's not his twin brother Jacob.This...doesn't surprise me at all, actually. I remember them seemingly having a better defense a couple years ago from all I watched, not that I can pick out years or anything at this point.You realize they've all but closed a deal to keep Herman right?

[Anyway.](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/2c/2c8106649df12de4b274b96ed88bdede9952ee3a8f96076d89bfffa5719b4d0e.jpg)When people say "they don't recruit" in an instance like above, they usually just mean they're not going after that great of players. 

Just realizing how this might come across, I meant no offense in regard to your brother.We're making a UNC sandwich with Stanford.[insert something about Fuente and Thug Life because I'm not clever enough]

Poor Kansas.A break from 0%Nice try, thieves.What if I told you that you can play zero FCS teams and still get ridiculed on /r/CFB.Still too high.Uhm.

edit: he's edited it now. Format wouldn't show the records. :p Good job OP!https://i.imgur.com/aQZHyh.jpg[No, please no.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/make_it_stop_boy_meets_world.gif)Looks similar, to a degree, to the boxes ESPN is now using, imagine that.Better be sure he has the chest for the job. :pSerious question, what do you see happening next year if Mullen were to stay without Dak's presence?I think he means "program-wise" and not really record/standings related "middle".Mr. Smartypants here. I believe having 2 losses to be worse than having 1 loss.Wait until after the CFP when one of the teams gets embarrassed. Just wait for those sweet sweet offseason posts.Except week 1. Don't you worry about Week 1.@Clemson in 2023, god dammit.

Also, we need to even up the series against Michigan.Welcome to subreddit popularity combined with the post/offseason.Almost had me.And /r/CFB has been on the anti-Bama rhetoric since the first CFP poll was released. Couple that with the massive numbers of B12 complainers who were told to fucking wait until things shake our and they actually play a couple winning football teams, and they did, and now OU's most likely in the playoff. It's amazing when you actually sit back and let things unfold before calling everything a conspiracy.

It's ESPN, it's all bullshit and taking common talking points from social media, and the B12/SEC/Bama narratives permeate more than any other conversations right now, so they talk about it like it's "news". With that record and the way OU finished, you're not getting left out. Everyone just needs to calm the fuck down.Whoa there, that's not True at all. 

They're completely separate *entities*.

Everyone knows ESPN is what is driving the CFP rankings. ^^^Pawl.&gt;ESPN has a very real anti-Big 12 and pro SEC bias, and it's not debatable.

My intent was not to challenge that. They're a media company with a direct stake in the SEC, of course they're going to drive that point home. If anyone actually watched FS1's CFB shows, I'm sure they have talking heads over there talking up the B12.

Lucky for you, and everyone else, these media entities aren't making the final decision as to who it actually IN the CFP.

The real point is "who the fuck cares what ESPN says?" Most of their "points" and reasons are about as sound as the anti-Bama posts we see every hour on /r/CFB. You're basically just *finding a reason* to be mad at ESPN and posting it here. And you don't need to actually look that hard. It's ESPN. They are a sports *entertainment* outlet.I would be okay with revenge against FSU.Michigan or FSU.

OSU perhaps, but they kinda scare me a lot right now, compared to the other two, with all our players out.Were you there?Show me a top ranked team right now that hasn't had at least one questionable game against a much-lesser-perceived opponent.Everyone looks for shit that they can disagree with, end of story, and then they hop on the internet to complain about it.Pretty sure they're using SOR because it factors in much of the CFP criteria, which were not created by ESPN.Is Lamar up for coaching CFB right now?Josh Adams[I'M IN QUARTERBACK HEAVEN!](http://i.imgur.com/SEEcpsB.gif)Ahh I figured for a second that you were that guy.

Have some chicken soup.Stanford....field goal.

*twitch*Plus, if he sticks around long enough to see BK depart, he could have curried enough favor with Swarbrick &amp; Co to convince them that he's the right successor. Would be amazing to see ND start building their own little "tree" of coaches from within the assistant ranks.Also, even many of the "bad" coaches that might be on the market are financially well off, so it's not like they NEED a job tomorrow. This is why saving money for a rainy day is smart so you have a little bit of a buffer of up to a couple months if you get let go, or perhaps even just to take a relaxer prior to interviewing and/or starting your next job.Either way, still dedicated. They didn't just walk out.He did a great job standing in for the disaster that was Brandon.As a semi-UGA supporter and someone with a Scott Cochran obsession (as a S&amp;C coach), this would be amazing.The pay is pretty shitty, though.I can't remember which other job, but I swear his name came up for another opening as well earlier in the year.I may not have been pleased with Greg Bryant's tenure at ND, but I really hope he has what it takes and learned a thing or two during his time in JUCO. If he listens to coaching, the sky's the limit. REALLY excited to see him play for UAB.*falls out of chair laughing*

Spend most of my time defending them on this garbage crusade those anti-Bama fools on /r/CFB have going on. And yes, it sickens me.Probably little to none and he's just painting with as large a brush as possible. It's ND and OSU so nobody cares if it's True or not.If Notre Dame didn't have multiple losses, they would be vying for a CFP spot right now. It's not conference membership. But I'd wager that from now on this is the narrative that the "lol join a conference" crowd is going to push from now on if ND is on the edge. Also, ACC fans will obviously be pushing for ND to join because it'll boost the perception of their conference.Honestly, if BYU had just gone undefeated against their schedule this year, not ND's, they'd have been in. Look at who they played early on (Neb, Boise, Michigan, UCLA).This one isn't even about Alabama.lol

I...I kinda want to see it happen just for the anger. I mean, I'd still be mad myself that they got left out too, but that would be *sorta* funny.People suck.GREAT NEWS!Hey, have some hope.

Come onnn big moneyWell, the CFP is already why the AP poll doesn't matter anymore. They take ZERO queues from that poll. Like, at all. The CFP committee has shown that they're completely open to teams moving at-will, because they re-rank them every week.

They don't drop or move-up a team like the AP progressively does over the course of the year, they're RE-RANKED each week lower or higher. That's what many people still have yet to grasp about the committee.

What's funny is some people still even have yet to understand the AP poll, as you'll see some say a team "got dropped" when in actuality it may just be that another team had a better showing (or the team that is now lower had a BYE) and was moved ahead of them. It's like having to tell little kids "that isn't YOUR spot".I think I'm confused because it's early. At this point, what I'm saying is it doesn't matter. The AP poll is literally obsolete now due to the CFP and people just need to stop discussing/complaining about it. Not that that will ever happen.

The CFP does exactly what we want it to do, only a bit later than some wanted (week 8/9 or whatever as opposed to like week 6), waiting until late in the season to start ranking teams.[No. Not this.](http://i.imgur.com/wqMWK7z.gif)Ahh, there we are.I have a great candidate you might be take a look at.

His name...uhh...Bave Drandon. Uh, Bave? Please, right this way sir.

^^/sFor once, facts prevail. Thank god.&gt;the best

That's not how you spell "the worst".Also, $$$.ND was above all the B12 teams until the absolute shit showing against BC. There's no way they get snubbed for "a conference champ" (without the 13th game in  the B12) if late in the season they have the record and the consistent level of play to show for it. Also, combine the potential to be ahead of the B12 who plays the same number of games with playing two teams, USC and Stanford, every year who are always in the running, seemingly, for the PAC12. So if ND is undefeated, which is the main expectation they'd have to be to get into the CFP, they're probably never getting snubbed  by the B12 "champ" or the PAC12, given that they play two top programs from that conference every year.

That's what I think AD Swarbrick is putting his money on right now, and it's a pretty damned smart bet.Shh, last thing we need is something else for people to make fun of.Actually, ND damn near handed that game away to UNC more so on turnovers, including a pick six. The ND defense did pretty well to contain them. although it was a struggle at times.That is correct. I believe it was only his first (maybe the second) series in, possibly, too.Plenty of questions. Neither team is guaranteed to have beaten the other.Yep, and for the most part all of us agree with that. The problem might be that if ND was in the ACC, they may not be guaranteed that they'd have a final regular season game against such a quality opponent as a top 10 Stanford.ND is not joining the B1G. As an institution, they don't match up at all with the majority of that conference's other member schools.From a pure football perspective, why would they?

His record at Wazzu has been...bad, for the most part. This is the first year he'll finish above .500 since his arrival.

edit: let me clarify, yes they were bad before he got there. What I think I'm trying to say is there's not enough good seasons yet to justify, IMO, someone going after him. Yes, they've improved, I'm not saying they haven't.Because another (aside from Bama) member of the Legion of Doom made it in.You know what, everyone is right, we should start using /r/CFB's polls for the CFP.I would love UVA if they pulled Richt. They'd be like my "other Tennessee". That said, this does seem like a high number.Serious question, any more info on the department's current financials? Also, what about booster support, etc?Shhhh. Give the people what they want.I bet Tim Beck doesn't bring a decided schematic advantage, though.I'm pretty sure actually wearing a headset is requirement #1.&gt; He basically never had a bad team

2/4 years at Wazzu he went 3-9. I'd say that's at least somewhere NEAR the "bad" category.


edit: misread the intent of that sentence, "at Tech" applies to both phrases.I hope they don't, but we'll see. They certainly did well this year, I was just saying that they did at least have a couple bad years.I...misread your intent in that sentence. I assumed "never had a bad team" was meant solely on its own and not to apply to "at Tech".True, but still I'd rather have a better sample size if it were me making that decision. They played well this year and hopefully another year or two will give us an idea of how things are progressing from an overall football "program" perspective.Whew, didn't have to scroll too far to find this.&gt;we don't deserve it!

You don't have to please anyone but yourself.&gt;AppState to Camellia

[Hey, you know who has a similar record to AppState right now?](http://www.stickfreaks.com/images/lulz/clooney_chuckle.gif)I'd also rather not play Houston. I want a P5 team, no offense to Houston.As he should be.Someone should tell him Chad Morris isn't their OC anymore.Your defense would be great, not sure about the offense, though. There's been a somewhat noticeable void at times this year with Clemson's offense since Morris' departure. Perhaps that's just because they're struggling to run a multi-OC (IIRC there's still two Co-OCs running things, guys "under" Morris for 2014) setup there, not sure.Yup.I just love that picture, really.I'm aware of this.&gt;They haven't come close to being a national power for a long long time. 

What.And cancel the series every time ND wins. /sMaybe because UGA is a bit of a step above Auburn, program-wise? And because he went there.Bruh, all you do is link your own blog bullshit.However, UGA is also top dog in their state while Auburn will always be second fiddle to Bama, as a program on the whole.  Plus, Georgia is a better recruiting state than Alabama.

All of these probably weigh in the minds of potential candidates.P~~ure~~oor Michigan.That dude really wins at losing. I just don't get it.I mean, even Fournette has basically been wiped from the actual conversation since that Bama game. That's what has me soured against the Heisman to a degree this year.Still, one year at Tennessee, and somehow USC is interested in him. Fails at USC and then he moves to...fucking BAMA.[:D](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjKxfz_juR0HH5JQhETQg8UArZc=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3999658/198af2kcuq5fwgif.0.gif)Mattison is still there, but I think he was "demoted" to DL coach only this past year, I want to say?Apparently Mark Richt has his choice of any open job.While that's True position-wise, that's still quite a move for a coach who really has nothing terribly impressive to his name as a head coach, aside from perhaps...his name.I mean, Swarbrick was a lawyer for decades prior to signing on with ND as AD, and also a grad in the 70s. He's doing a bang up job right now for the program. A smart guy in a position like that is pretty much exactly what a big program needs. A lawyer can read through a lot of the bullshit in contracts, too. They also bring a fair amount of contacts with them, when they have that level of experience, typically.That's the best way to reveal going to the Bahamas Bowl I think we'll ever see.His snap on that play wasn't even on target.

&gt;deep snapper

*giggles*I saw this earlier on theScore app. Didn't want to put it up because of the topic. Not really sure what to think about this, or just how good or bad the Georgia GOP is compared to the national-level GOP.

Honestly, though, this should probably be removed...as it won't end well.&gt;~~/r/cfb~~ anywhere on the internetI...what's the point of this post. Your LS isn't remotely Heisman-worthy, nobody's is.Can you elaborate on the current governor? (without setting too many people off, maybe?)Well, I don't like you. I actually kinda like Auburn (although Tennessee is my fave in the SEC).&gt; In what way? recent success? national titles? hesimans? Wins? Head to head? Because they all favor Auburn. 

"As a program" deals with far more than just those individual items you're cherry-picking, and I think you know that. That's like saying because Auburn has a more recent NC and/or Heisman winner, that they're a better (or comparable) job/program overall than USC (Southern Cal), which we all know is absurd, I hope.As a coach, you're looking at the resources you have available. Recruiting state/availability/location, money available, facilities, etc. Everything that would help you build a successful program, regardless of past individual achievements.

&gt;Its wins and losses, its simple.

It's really not. What a past coach has done at a school isn't a determining factor as to how attractive a job might be for a prospective coach, head coach or coordinator. It's the environment and whether or not that environment fosters success (fan support, money, recruiting, in-state competition, etc), and in this case it's a comparison between two. Not saying Auburn isn't a positive influence on their program, I'd just say UGA has a slight edge.Honestly, I do think a lot of it has come down to luck when it comes to the coaches. Recently, Richt has also had some pretty bad luck as of late, like 2013 with the injuries or issues with Schotty as OC this year, with some of their seasons.

Not saying Auburn is bad or that far behind, but I think moving into a school that's the flagship university that's actually within a top recruiting state, a tier the state of Alabama really isn't *quite* in yet, is a BIG attraction as well as the overall finances for UGA being there, I believe, a little better than Auburn right now. Overall I think as a university UGA something like doubles Auburn's endowment, but I'm not positive on that.

IIRC, as far as income-wise, I think UGA, regardless of recent record on the field, is only #2 (maybe #3) to Alabama in the entire SEC when it comes specifically to football revenue, but I could be wrong. I think LSU is the one that rounds out the top 3, IIRC. Can't find the list I remember seeing right now.:(

[Please accept this as a token of my apology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZRKQ6YFuHo)I can guarantee ND will never play a regular season game on a Sunday.I think they've had a few Basketball games once or twice, off the top of my head (women's maybe as well). I DON'T see them ever doing the same for football in the regular season.As a Bears fan:

LOLhttp://i.imgur.com/NQHKSVE.gifI don't know. That's up for him and his family to decide. :pCalm down. He was just banging Mark Richt's maid.Ahh yeah, there is one. I know there's been a few, but I can't keep track of BBall games like I do FB games, given the larger number. I just always wait until my phone tells me usually. Always watching them though.Having a 13th game would have given Baylor another quality opponent (rematch or not). So yeah, it screwed them, especially when you consider their OOC schedule. With that 13th game, it would have gone a LONG way to sway the committee.

Plus, all of the years you are naming have zero bearing on how the CFP committee selects teams, now, and a CCG is one of their top factors, being as it boosts a team's overall SOS as well.Well, if they had enough teams to actually have a CCG in the first place, then they MAY not have played in the regular season, depending on the scheduling of the divisions/number of conference opponent games.

Rematch or not, it's another game against a quality opponent.Then that wouldn't change much, especially if your OOC was still crap.
The lack of a 13th game and the OOC schedule is what is killing the B12's teams not named OU (who have good OOC for the most part, and TCU to an extent).

I guess I'm at a loss as to how you'd get away with having less regular season games than everyone else, I thought 12 was a requirement now, but I'm not that aware of those rules.Honestly, don't think this is a bad hire, if it happens.Yes, yes we can.

Also, IIRC Daelin was the one that had some sort of injury issue recently, perhaps throughout his whole HS career, so some schools maybe backed off.

I could totally be thinking of someone else, though.

[Also, check out the percentages on 247sports, if we want to be honest here according to the "top schools" rankings.](http://247sports.com/Player/Daelin-Hayes-25739)

UM is #2 to ND, according to those.Shit, I had no idea it was that few. Any source on that? Not challenging just curious.True, I'm not necessarily buying him as THAT great of a talent at this point, given those issues. I think one of the times his season was cut short was only because they moved back to MI from Cali, IIRC, though. Ah well, not like we have issues with injuries or anything to worry about. I'm totally sure he'll be fine.BYU, in Vegas. No temptation at all.We have a GIF/Video/Vine thread for this, yaknow?/r/pleasestopthisshit&gt;finebaum

Disregarding stats and actually watching everyone play...

QB - Deshaun Watson

RB - Derrick Henry

TE - Jake...from Mi-that place. State Farm, that's it.

WR -  Corey Coleman

LB - Jaylon Smith

DB - Mackensie AlexanderThink he's going "skill" position only.I wanted to put Jalen Ramsey, but I couldn't really oust Mack for him at this point in time in my mind.http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223463/Jaylon_Smith_in_coverage.jpgOh yeah, their run game is fantastic. Also consider that Ragland has the luxury of having Reuben Foster for help, and Devall/Lee both to a slightly lesser extent.

Once ND had to put sophomore Martini in place of Onwualu, that's helped, but Schmidt has been a pain lately, really, mostly I think due to his injury from last year putting the brakes on his game. He's just not the same. So, Jaylon has made up for it. He can jump out to CB/NB if an audible is called in a pinch and go stride for stride with a receiver, FFS. It's absurd, really. Dude can cross from basically sideline to sideline to make tackles without skipping a beat. Honestly, it's selfish, but I can't wait to see what would happen if he came back for his senior year.

I'm not even going to apologize for saying it. Jaylon Smith IS the best LB in the country. Period.Because the whole sub has a MASSIVE anti-SEC bias.

/threadedit: No. ~~Fuck that.~~

~~&gt;From an idea floated by Big XII Conference Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.~~

~~Ahh. Now it all makes sense. Bottom line, the B12 is gonna have to expand, most likely, and they're digging their heels in as much as possible, possibly for the fact that the money split will be slightly less with more teams.~~With Tennessee has his third team.To be fair, that no longer happens after last year's debacle, IIRC.Yet...Pretty sure Notre Dame is /r/CFB's team.[Yeah, every girl you know said that. Not you.](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Jennifer-Lawrence-ok-thumbs-up.gif)If they won it all, that would make it even worse around here. It'd be Jameis x infinity.I meant that if OSU got in and won it all, the hate would be worse than FSU fans experienced last year with the Jameis BS around /r/CFB.&gt;if Clemson, Bama and Standord lose then UNC and ND should get in



Whoa wait, what? ND getting in at this point is not something even I can support.YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK VIRGINIA!!!

Damn you, convicts (:p). Looks like Miami might be back.Early 90s/late 80s, please.Congrats Canes. Big hire. You have the best CFB coach in Florida.Has nobody heard of Notre Dame star True freshman RB Josh Adams yet? It's Josh Adams.

Shoutout to OLB Greer Martini, too. Also, Safety Elijah Shumate doesn't get enough credit for all the work he does all over. Unfortunately, he'll be leaving.&gt;Most haven't heard of LB Cameron Smith

Wut. Maybe it's just me, cause I've paid a lot of attention to far too many teams.It's Miami.

edit: and now it's not, according to another post. :/Just edited above. WTF is going on, god dammit coaching changes.UVA pls,Maybe because it's entirely weird to track flights like that.I can't think of a single place with a tougher starting QB decision this offseason. I REALLY don't know what it is, but there's still something about Malik's attitude outside of his gameplay to me that I think speaks to the team when he's on the field, though. And the biggest thing is I think his presence resonates throughout the defense as well.I'm pretty sure it was a one year deal.

The UVA one absolutely devastated me, with Malik's injury. I gotta say, given everything that's happened this year, they managed to pick the best year with all the crazy stuff going on. Sometimes you have to wonder how much of a distraction on players this series may have been, too. Because of that, I really hope they do a different team, frankly, so avoid all that added camera-in-your-face next season and just let them play their game.The potential is certainly there, I think, as much as some have their doubts about him.Smart answer would be no because you have to get started as early as possible maintaining current recruits and trying last minute to grab others.[Relevant.](https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaNgOfthoKdlZTvVRqycgySCSMY=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4098512/COvPPiVU8AA1d3q.jpg_large.0.0.jpg)Swweeeeeet.Ruudy Ruudy Ruudy.

Pretty much the story of the team this year. "Okay kid, go get'em!"Kinda off topic, but there used to be a "tourism" video of Ames, but I think it was made up by ISU. I can't seem to find it on Youtube, but it was kinda hilarious and was hoping someone might know where it is.Much like Texas.I'm not even sure, but perhaps. I thought it was just about the local area/university alone. Was hilarious, they show ISU faculty riding in a car and everything in front of what looks like a terrible green screen, IIRC.I'm not sure if that's a good sign.Uhh, how do we know this is because they hired Richt?TCU to Fiesta Bowl confirmed.I have recently noticed a pickup in the number of Bama fans in the Midwest. The large script "A" on pickup trucks is...more common now than I remember, anyway.That bit was great. Reminded me of the "kissing on the couch" commercial.I mean, players' parents never went to the school either. Are you gonna laugh at them, too?

Just don't abandon your team when they're bad. When it comes to some schools, the alumni base, or potentially just your family member's class/group, is also closely knit, so you get exposure to it all your life, as have I with ND. Not much you can do about that, IMO.Speaking of that, is it Finebaum that's a Vol but a huge Bama homer? I can't remember.If you give someone actual shit about their degree, that's...a different kind of special. General pieces of shit are always annoying, whether a fan of a team or not.Which is why I maintain that it was still actually harder for ND to get in than many other teams, depending on the situation, even though people like to point to "the Notre Dame rule". I think we had like an 8-win (maybe 7-5 even) Wisconsin in there at least once and a couple other teams with less than even 10 wins. Meanwhile, ND HAD to be ranked I think it was top 8 or 12 to get in, which requires a much better record against potentially a much tougher schedule.

Still, didn't really find the BCS to be that great of a system with the tie-ins specifically, and also didn't necessarily like that there was that special rule at times, lol. If a team doesn't win their conference but has a much better record than another that just happened to play well in their CCG, the team that didn't win their conference probably should have gotten in. Selection should have been done a little more carefully, ironically kind of like what they're doing now with the committee.I disagree.[Don't fight it.](https://i.imgur.com/RsOWR2xh.jpg)*twitch*This is like Congress self-policing themselves, isn't it?ND would basically be shocking the world from their couches.Admittedly reading now. Was more making a joke, given the headline.Can. Did.

:p&gt;Mack Brown

What.

&gt;We also understand former Texas head coach Mack Brown has sought the position but has not received an interview as of this time. 

LOL. Go figure. Dude kind of destroyed what he created himself (obviously on the back of an already prestigious program, not saying he "built" Texas in the same way some others have created their programs)  at literally THE biggest job in the country.

&gt;Virginia has sought one trait above all others: head coaching experience.

Like, when word came out that maybe Sanford at ND was a candidate?

&gt;Sources tell FootballScoop

Sources.I would sure be up for playing FSU again.Paging /u/LegacyZebraNew day, new SEC post.That the SEC is still purported by ESECPN to be the iPhone of conferences. Duh.Maybe give him the surprise salami.Thought so too, which is why they have her on their little "chair conversations" about the CFP now.[Pay that me-an his money.](http://giant.gfycat.com/JitteryUnluckyAmethystsunbird.gif)Iowa is being heavily underrated by both analysts and especially random fans who haven't watched them play. That's pretty much how I see it.

I honestly expect a close game.Everyone just needs to use the "suggest title" button that's literally provided on the "new post" page, and if that doesn't work, like on SBNation stuff, then just copy and paste the article name as the title.

That would solve a whole lot of anguish.[Lnik to voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfbcirclejerk/comments/3v8snk/1_upvote_1_heisman_vote_for_keenan_reynolds/) ^^^^/s:(Man that's a great exchange.Fucking homer SEC alphabet. I hate that alphabet.Seriously, though. One season, Auburn's defense looks a little better, and then he just peaces out.He's not dead yet.Miami peaches &gt; Georgia peachesHEY BAMMERS! STOP SHUTTING DO-

Just kidding.Reggie LeinartMalik Zaire, easily.

Honestly, Kizer has been amazing as a stand-in. But I think the team as a whole would have played better had Malik not went down, for what his vocal nature and outward emotion meant to them. Combine that with being even more of a threat in the QB run game, that changes a lot of things, IMO, and I think the red zone offense would have been better with him, too.

edit: I just realized that the post said "a team" not "your team". Whoops.I don't know if everyone feels that way. It's obvious to me though that the team as a whole played differently with Malik at the helm than with Kizer, it was a different dynamic, IMO.

I'd be surprised if either of Malik or DeShone transfer, given their recent experiences with the rest of their team that's coming back next year. Remember, Golson transferred in part because there was a disconnect between he and the team, not just the starting role issues, a problem which I don't see between these two. I think the threat for a transfer would come from Wimbush, solely because he looks to be the clear #3 (although that also depends on how Malik responds in the spring, after coming back from injury). Frankly, though, given the events of last year with Golson's transfer and Malik's injury, all of them could see just "how close" they are to the starting job, too, which could in theory make all of them think twice before transferring.

Combine that with the fact that they're all learning under one of the best QB coaches in the country, Sanford, who has recently openly stated his intent to stay at ND.Well, really if we look at it, nobody else's loss could have had a bigger impact, I don't think.

Folston has replaced, possibly by a guy better than him, then Adams came in and made his impact felt after Prosise went down.

Shaun Crawford never started a game, so we really don't know what the impact of his loss was.

Jarron Jones' loss may have been a big loss, but likening that to losing Malik, it's just not quite at that level I don't think when Tillery did what he did freeing up Sheldon to do his thing.

EQ is out, but never saw time and probably wasn't going to, given how deep the WR corps was this year.

KVR was only lost for the Stanford game, and Devin Butler honestly played very well as his replacement, possibly better than KVR's inconsistent self he's been all year.

Prosise's loss (as I said above), Adams stepped in, in a major way. The RB situation wasn't as big of a loss simply in part because of just HOW GOOD this OL was this year, for the most part, when they were full strength.

Onwualu was lost for Martini, a better OLB, IMO, and an OLB by nature, not a converted position.

Bars was a backup OL to Quenton Nelson

Durham Smythe COULD have been a bigger loss, but we don't really know because we really never tried using the TEs as much as they probably should have this year, especially with Aliz'e Jones' athletic ability.

And Drue Tranquill was a starter in part only for the GT game, but may have had a few other starts down the road, but not necessarily the biggest loss. Hard to say.

That's kind of my reasoning for why I arrived at Malik being the biggest loss overall.While I think Jarron was a big loss, Tillery and Cage still plugged it up which allowed Sheldon to do his thing, which is usually the role that Jarron fills, in my eyes. They also rotated the DL around a fair amount and used Rochell in the middle as well, as they did last year, a package/look that you wouldn't even see Jarron Jones on the field for IIRC from last year. So I'm just not positive that he was bigger than losing Malik.http://i.imgur.com/AEBxNqc.gifDid I just get told to read Facebook comments?IIRC Bama's TE did a thing like this too.[Sherman's I think you're talking about on Bourbon Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi_ly7HTSzk)Yes. I'm always blocking them, though.1988 specifically. Aww yiss.*Pawl/r/olltide &lt;3This is what the CFP is this year, right? RIGHT?!Hey. Just so you know, Mark Richt isn't going to be coaching UGA in their bowl.I'd say there's a *small* gap between Muschamp and Spurrier, especially back when they hired him at SCar.So, who's the frontrunner right now?I remember all the GaSo fans came out of the woodwork along with GT fans earlier this year and everyone telling us about the "vendetta" CPJ had against BVG, and how Johnson was going to embarrass him.

LOL, good times.The two problems: too complex, and lack of a focus on the secondary's development. Other than that, I think the front 7 for the most part overall had been stellar. Schmidt's issues I believe boiled down to is own physicality and and I think potentially the lingering issues from his injury last year. I truly believe that had quite the negative effect on him, because he was better before that injury.I don't think it's gonna be that bad at all, mainly since UNC has a FAR better QB than Michigan, in Marquise. Obviously different teams, but still, just saying Williams is probably more capable of putting the team on his shoulders, so to speak, IMO.That was week 1, and they handed that game to SCar on a silver platter with an uncharacteristically bad game by Williams, especially in the turnover department.Hand signs and everything.They're called Convicts.

I guess we can call them ConRichts now.I'm gonna need a repeat of 2011 Miami@VT.

"That makes the task of ~~Al Golden~~ Mark Richt and ~~Jacory Harris~~ Brad Kaaya that much more difficult..."Look at this. These people are losing their minds.Dafuq is Chat Sports. Sounds like a site some kid just made up.Annnnd I'm excited as fuck. I thought this Saturday was gonna kinda suck, too, with the smaller number of games.

Especially Yale.What a great story. Really looking forward to making a game in Sanford sometime soon, and to perhaps see Que close up. :pThese puppet skits are absolutely hilarious. The B12/conference bias one was amazing, if that's the last one they did., IIRC. [Nope was Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLhNDEgWE9Q)

LOL @ HadenIs there going to be a live stream of this one?I really don't think anything will ever capture the iPhone guy. Then again, that Temple to the B12 guy certainly was up there.&gt;**Auburn Tigers:** We ran our college football media survey before the season. Two thirds of respondents projected Auburn into the playoff. There was some collective Kool-Aid drunk, for sure. Though, 6-6 with unimpressive wins remains a profound disappointment. Worse, the offense was the issue. Jeremy Johnson went from breakout Heisman candidate to the bench. The running game never got going in a meaningful way. Will Muschamp looks like he\u2019s gone. Welcome to the hot seat, Gus Malzahn.
&gt; 
&gt;**Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets:** The Yellow Jackets started the season No. 16 in the AP poll. They dropped 134 points on their first two opponents. Then, against a tough schedule, Tech collapsed going 3-9. Some drop off was anticipated, given the offensive transition. But, few expected things to get this bad. This was Johnson\u2019s first GT team to miss a bowl game and first to finish with a below .500 conference record (1-7). A lot of one-score losses there, but still\u2026
&gt; 
&gt;**Nebraska Cornhuskers:** The Cornhuskers fired Bo Pelini, as 9-10 wins per year was not enough. They went outside the box, hiring much nicer guy Mike Riley. In his first season, Nebraska went 5-7. Six one-score losses show they were competitive. Tommy Arm Punt was prime entertainment, if you weren\u2019t a Nebraska fan and did not fade that huge public line.
&gt; 
&gt;**Missouri Tigers:** A Top 10 defense and\u2026perhaps the worst offense in FBS. Maty Mauk was not an efficient quarterback. Missouri dealt with some injuries and had a lot to replace from 2014. Still, given the track record, you would expect the Tigers to do something with the ball. They scored two touchdowns over their final five SEC games. 3.3 yards/play and three points in Gary Pinkel\u2019s send off against Arkansas. Unwatchable.
&gt; 
&gt;**UCF Knights:** The Knights had won 31 games the previous three seasons. With nine starters returning, total, some level of dip was anticipated. No one expected an 0-12 season that would see George O\u2019Leary fire himself as athletic director and head coach. The Knights did not allow a kickoff or punt return for a touchdown. That\u2019s about the only thing they did well. Thankfully that poor Orlando bar is only giving away free beer during UCF games. Come to Notre Dame, we have quarterbacks! And dry bread wafers and wine.I feel like that was almost expected, given 2014. Last year (2014) they were purported to be a "top 10" team for some reason even after losing a boatload of players, some of them great, especially almost I think their entire front 7 between 2013-14 (corrected). This is only IIRC, I might be a little off.

edit: Corrected, I meant between 13-14Nah, he was talking to the B12, I remember because he was trying to make comparisons between Temple and Cincy, IIRC, Cincy being a team that's been in that conversation for a while.Probably just going full overboard to make fun of the guy even more?Yeah, I noticed that too. It was more about the attitude, and I don't see how that's some big secret at this point.At least it's not Tommy Turnover. Having a healthy QB all season that's the caliber of Watson helps the most.I'd say it's more or less definitely in his court. His first retirement came on the heels of two consecutive losing seasons. One has to wonder if that's what drove him to make that decision then, too, and if that will come into play again if next season is similarly rough.I'm already planning on making a "Catholics vs ConRichts" shirt for our upcoming game against them next season.Will Fuller returns and burns Adoree Jackson again.I smell...fear.Priorities. \u0ca0_\u0ca0To be fair, they have to take a break from tweeting high schoolers at SOME point.Pretty plausible. Just like FSU, Houston, etc are also plausible.

OSU or FSU may be pushed because that'd be a BIG ticket, probably.Yep, that's a popular sentiment right now and I have to agree.Fuck everything about that jersey.Found the dirty commie.UABNot necessarily a recruit or the coaching carousel, but the guy I'd be afraid of losing as of right now might be Brandon Wimbush, looking at how ND's QB situation is setting up to be. All also depends on how Malik looks once he's back on the field from injury.

Honestly, the biggest "recruiting" job ND can do this offseason is convince Jaylon Smith to stay,  much like they did Ronnie Stanley last offseason.Yeah, BYU starting with last year did everything an Indy has to do to get into the CFP for the future. Let's hope everyone else starts to adopt the same approach. Think about every week having at least one amazing game in each time slot.Doesn't matter, complain anyway. It's all a conspiracy.Derrick MayesSo, how long does this bet last for?Came across this just a bit ago. I know it's player-specific, but he's pretty damned impressive to watch when the camera will iso on him. So I figured I would post it anyway. Also includes some highlights from 2014.

[This channel has a bunch of highlight vids they do for players all over](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6dPG_WDl-wnAagtmtRdXw)Coke + Michigan flair...I don't see either of those dudes transferring,  as I get the feeling they are too ingrained into the team now. Malik with his leadership early and Kizer with what he did this year. We'll see. That's all based on "feeling" and obviously optimism. And, both of them saw this year just "how close" the #2 guy is, if something happens.Uhh, did that not hit him? XD Really?Now you jinxed it, lol.Oh. My. God.Uhh, don't be hurt. Is there another QB for Baylor right now?

edit: uhh, they just answered. Briles said "I have no idea".You mean top NFL Draft pick Cardale Jones?I'm need a pic of that dude in the bear costume, pronto.Cmon man.I did. :DI think your team was sleeping, too. They might have woken up.You don't fucking leave your sideline. Might want to start learning how this game works.Wait what the fuck. They cleared their fucking BENCH and they don't call anything on Baylor? What a bunch of dumb shit.You don't leave your sideline. It's that simple. 

edit: to clarify, I understand WHY they cleared, but they still should have been called is all I'm saying.UNC and Baylor are COMPLETELY different types of teams, IMO.Proooobably should have been a delay of game.Everything, apparently.inb4 "no Baylor is just terrible"

All kidding aside, they're on like their 4th QB nowKendal's probably young enough that he has a few years left in him.He limped out the last time he was on the field.FYI, for those of you asking why Heard is in, Swoopes limped off the field last time he was in.I want to say it was one of the punts, but I can't remember positively at this point.Dangerous hit by Texas... :/Whoa wait a minute, nobody looks like Samardzija except Samardzija.Hey, whoever the mad guy is in the thread, I hope you stub your toe 10 times today.Looks like we're punting the rest of the game.Honestly, it's probably more than just them, lol.Yes, but Stanford and Clemson are TWO quality losses. This just in: ND to supplant OU in the CFP.

:pI dunno, I think it's kinda cool that the freshmen get to do that.[SERIOUS]

Has there *always* been this lack of control over the team for Baylor, or is this mostly recent years when they got good?I thought that said Nick Bosa and wondered wtf I was missing.You knew that wasn't a catch, come on man.Well Temple finally scored, so maybe.Yeah but if it's Texas HS FB then that's basically college. :pMissed FG, Baylor can't catch a break today.I don't understand what the problem is. Everyone doesn't have a True freshman tree that they can just pluck new game-ready players from? /sBoth teams sucking now. This is gonna be a shitshow of a 2nd half if this continues.lolWell that worked out well.Well at least you start next year with a chance for a big win at home.Coleman just gave up a first down, wtf.4 for Baylor.Luckily they're Baylor, so that's just another day in the life of their offense, if they start going.OH MY GOD THEYRE GONNA SCORE


edit: maybe.I am so sick and fucking tired of seeing injuries this year.Are there any injuries on Baylor's starting OL or are they just getting beat? Drango is still there, IIRC.Time to score Baylor!

edit: Uhhh, nope.Might want to leave, for your own safety. :pI have to say, I can't look away.Yes, Johnson went down and went to the locker room. He's out at least for the rest of this one, it looks like.Even with a loss, you can still finish with a bowl win to round out a 10 win season. Not bad at all when you've lost multiple QBs.:(*Kind* of a dick move.*Crank YankersAsk UGA fans, they're familiar with this.Glass houses. :pClemson loses, we get rematch of Clemson/ND anyway outside of the CFP. /sI just can't do hard boiled eggs at all. Makes me sad.I mean, Michigan outgained ND last year. Didn't work out so well.Man I'm just loving SoMiss being back. And I have no idea why.Watch them run Wildcat every play in the 2nd half, Baylor wins 21-20.If you can't stop this, then I have nothing to say.

edit: you're not gonna get much sympathy from me on the injury front.Welp, it was fun while it lasted Texas.Ehh, I saw a bit of empty areas, to be fair. Not completely though.Game update: temple finally scored a TD. Score now 24-10.lolHow you gonna lose to a team without a QB.I swear to god, I can't believe it. Not only that, blowing a 20 point halftime lead.[This whole game.](http://i.imgur.com/7BpQN6l.gif)If they didn't end up kicking the FG, I would have called them the dumbest staff in CFB.Fun fact: Texas will have two top 15 wins if they beat Baylor today.Call Jake...with State Farm.Just a bunch of flailing about when he's on offense anyway.Swoopes makes half of Baylor's blitzing defenders look like dwarves."I think that was a poor decision by Charlie Strong there."

Didn't these fuckers both just say they should go for it? Or was it only one of them.Okay that's a little better, lol.Hey Texas. PSSST!

They're not fucking throwing it.I know there are injuries on Texas' defense, but this is fucking pathetic.

Like I said, 4-2, safeties only. (obviously /s.....sorta)Next puntblock/safety incoming.Must've had a wide open invisible receiver out there.Shamrocks.

Ain't nobody fucking with the most perfect helmet in CFB, though.Get out.HOLY SHIT. FUMBLE.lol
What the fuck is this UF offense. This is just SO bad.Has to be the worst feeling in the world when UF fans see their offense back on the field.


HOOOOOOOLY SHIT!.Welp, that was the last score of the game.

GG guys.If you stay in your lanes, that's not that big of a problem.No go ahead, run it out.Yes, a shame.LOL.No way, they have emphatically stated that they're going to keep it 4 for a while.It's 7-5. What the fuck.Ball still has to cross the LOS. Not saying it didn't, tho.Okay that was an amazing catch.Nice try, Hawkeye.Honestly, that's kind of a stupid rule that you can't throw again, especially if you can still run it. Maybe it's just me.Ok.Closer than some expected so far, to be fair.Here's hoping the 2nd half is as close as the first.Bruh you created a whole post with one sentence that's basically "DAE DRINKING?!" Tell me more about "input".Oh you'll take UF winning? Okay then. :DSomeone ought to get a pooper scooper for that field full of pieces of shit.Before the injuries, definitely. Current state? Most likely not. And the defense in 2012 was actually better, they were just woefully unprepared for that one game. The offense however in 2012 was atrocious for the most part. This year, the scheme has unfortunately caused many problems defensively.Really. Catch the fucking ball.Wow this offense sucks.Boo.I wish this was possible, oh my god.NOOOOooooo.Fucking Alabama WRs.Mark May, for short, which explains a lot."Here comes the Florida offense."

Nice try.

edit: see?Man, what the hell.Ahh yes, now's the time when UF's defense starts folding because they've been doing ALL the work.lol @ Verne's "WOW!"Who IS the backup for UF right now?Christmas at Stevie Wonder's house has to be fucking amazing.lol 

:(They have a solid shot.Yes.Treon Harris is worse than Tommy Rees.Luckily other games with offenses on the field will start soon.Having this current Florida team as your CCG opponent is basically cheating. /sinb4 they're all in the stands.I feel like his OL really isn't doing him any favors either.Ha, haven't watched him for a while.Not QUITE as bad as it looked, but still late.Wow, so fucking close.Up to 8 points. You have to be able to make it up in one possession, and you can do that with 8 points, TD and a 2pt conversion.Nobody is overlooking them. This "no respect" mentality at this point needs to end.Seriously, what the fuck just happened with the punt?

Dabo acting like it wasn't a fake and the kicker did anyway.Go coach the fucking game and quite yelling at your punter. Yeah, he fucked up, we get it.Dude he tackled him there, lol.


Ehh, may have not been catchable.What the shit.Jesus. Ah well it's not like you need  TJ Green, he's not a starting DB or anything.No dancing in the locker room at halftime.Even if they win, I wouldn't be dancing too much after this shitshow so far. Just all sorts of weirdness.This game.Something tells me Dabo won't forget that.I'm watching all three at the same time. It's great.That's OPI.This is Watson, this ain't Cardale. :pOh my god if they don't get a TD now.There ya go.I never trust this website, FootballScoop.Hey Stanford, yeah...that Ronald Jones kid is pretty good. Might want to watch out for him.Jones is good, but don't kid yourself.That was like the widest open field I've ever seen.That was quick.LOL, seriously?Don't get too excited. Anything can still happen in around 30 seconds.


._.#GOOOO GRRRRREEEEEN!#GO GREEN!!!I disagree.Let's not go dancing around too much, Mr. Watson.Never underestimate blind homerism.What am I looking at here, besides paintbrush strokes?Look, OP, if you can't find some batteries to chow down on, it might be time to drive down to Lubbock. I'm sure they can help you out.Aaaannnd it's gone.Clearly overrated. /s


edit: added /s for people who can't detect itNo.OP's mom.Oh damn, I thought for a second we weren't going to have these posts this weekend!

Haha, no I didn't, I knew they would happen.The parts where one of ND's players DIDN'T get injured.But...OP is a Michigan fan.I wouldn't let you touch anything with my penis anyway.Yes please. God yes please FSU.Bobby Diaco is building a monster. Just you wait.There there, Hawkeye. Y'all have had a hell of a season. Not even surprised that shit was close, Iowa was underrated in a lot of people's eyes.

ONE MORE GAME TO GO! IT AIN'T OVER YET! SO PICK YOUR HEAD UP!I...yes.I'm still not sure how I've survived this year with both my teams (or all three frankly, with Tennessee).

My heart is either strong as fuck or I've got a season or two left.You won in 2013, against a Rees-led team after Golson was suspended and all that, pretty sure you mean 2012 and 2014, with Golson to Koyack at the end.Battlefrog getting put on the MAP with the big name matchup.We wanted a P5 team., so yaaaaaaay.Fiesta, 2006, IIRC.I debated not putting the sponsor name. For a split second.Because Iowa is above them, IIRC?Well what should excite you is watching Joe Schmidt try and tackle Zeke. :pCan confirm.

*twitch*Let's not get overconfident. ND has a...history...with big bowls.Luckily it's Elliot vs Smith and not Elliot vs Schmidt.Yeah, Jarrett has been great at times when he's in. Honestly, I'd bet it's because he doesn't know the playbook like JS, who also helps people line up given his knowledge of the plays, and also he's the signal caller on defense.

Schmidt's downside is his playing ability, but his upside is making everyone else better by putting them in position to make plays, etc.Briles actually came out in support of playing nobodies at one point, IIRC. Plus, the main thing was the hiring of a PR firm just to push for them in the CFP and the moaning about being left out last year.

I've actually kinda grown to see it from their side more recently, and can understand some of the hate while also empathizing with their position. They can't change those OOC games right away, so it's gonna take time for them to adjust. But still, they need to work as hard as they can to add better OOC games. Problem is, some teams might also avoid them, too.He did help them learn, but if you recall last year, when he went out, the defensive playbook was VERY simplified in particular because of Morgan's presence. Schmidt was actually the 2nd man for being the play-caller last year, as Collinsworth was supposed to be the primary play caller on defense until he got injured. So once JS went down, that changed the whole dynamic of that defense even more when it comes to organization/pecking order.

Yes, every player will help others line up at times, giving points to the right spot etc, and Jaylon does that as well, as he's slowly stepped himself further into a leadership role over the course of the year. But, if you recall before the season, the goal of the defense this year was to "free Jaylon up" to do their thing as well, so they're doing what they can to let him focus on his primary role alone.
Should probably keep an eye on Cajuste.Hey lay off, OSU has had so many down years recently.

This is Grace's first year with this defense. BVG started in 2014 and Grace was out all year with the injury from 2013. So he's never really "played" in that defense until this year.I'm okay with this.10am, I think? Maybe they're only two hours back, I can't remember.So unique.Do you include the offensive line in "offense"?But...you're not Miami.  :p[MRW ND/OSU Fiesta Bowl](https://i.imgur.com/GfJNU68.jpg)[Better?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8OxfUftiYRU/maxresdefault.jpg)Yeah, this is kind of a popular "recruiting time" for most coaches. It's an off week before bowl practice. Really looking forward to what he can do at UGA.[Before a Clemson fan posts it.](http://i3.tigernet.com/stories/15/facebook/brian_kelly.JPG)Wow, this dude is doing everything he can to stick with them.

edit: I meant this in a good wayKnew there was a better quality version. Without the intentional close-up it's really not as bad.What...bowl game?Well would you look at that.&gt; The nearest Baylor defender celebrated like he had personally broken up the pass, and his celebration was as if he just batted down a 4th &amp; Goal pass in the last second of the national championship game.

This sounds like what happens in NCAA14 when a receiver drops a pass and the defender that was SUPPOSED to be covering him celebrates afterward, lol.Yeah, I uh...meant that in a good way above.Off the top of my head, BYU/Utah, Miami/Wazzu, Pitt/Navy

Ohh ASU/WVU Cactus Bowl, later game on Jan 2nd. Woo.God dammit. I want all the bowls!Nice 2nd flair!If I had to guess, probably because of their most recent performance being an absolute domination of OkSt in Stillwater. Most importantly, there is a pantload of time between now and when that game will happen, so the lines and projections right now mean absolutely nothing.&gt;Ohio State is the best team in the country. 


This means Notre Dame are National Champs if they somehow manage to beat OSU, right?

&gt;When the Rose Bowl is a shit show and Ohio State embarrasses Notre Dame, people will say hindsight is 20/20, but I'm saying it now. 

I, too, enjoy saying things.

&gt;I'm personally a Northwestern and B1G fan so there is **no bias**

*Says OSU will embarrass ND.* :/

&gt; I just don't think that MSU nor Iowa are the right teams to represent the conference. 

One of these teams beat OSU already. With their backup QB, no less.&gt;Oklahoma has a Heisman QB who is undisturbed by pressure and is highly mobile

You just described Watson.

&gt;Sterling Shepherd is a top 10 WR easily

They may not have a lone "top 10 WR" individually, but their WR corps is absurdly deep in talent. Anyone can have a single top WR, but when you have every single target on the field as a threat, that can cause problems for any secondary, no matter how good you think they are.

&gt;Oklahoma defense is a mirage at times with Mike Stoops calling blitz packages that rattle QBs

They've already seen similar approaches this year, namely with BVG's defense at ND. Also, you might want to research Watson a bit more, as his main time to shine is actually when he is under pressure from blitzes, etc. Do it at your own peril.

&gt;Zack Sanchez and Jordan Thomas are interception sharks and Eric Striker and Charles Tapper eat QBs and linemen for breakfast. 

And if they have to, Clemson's screen/short passing game is capable of severely limiting that threat from CBs, although as things have progressed over the year they've found a way downfield more often, also finding Renfrow to be a solid target that some might not take as seriously as they should. Between he and TE Leggett, I think both of them tend to be overlooked.

&gt;Zack Sanchez and Jordan Thomas are interception sharks and Eric Striker and Charles Tapper eat QBs and linemen for breakfast. 

That's where you may find your best success, as their tackles can be problematic, as one is only starting his first year this season. That said, as stated above, pressure Watson at your own risk. He's VERY good in those situations. Plus, Gallman may not be a top back, but he's well-used to get the ball out of Watson's hands quickly.&gt;And no other ranked teams. 

Most teams only play roughly 2-4 ranked teams by season's end.

&gt;Oklahoma played 4 ranked teams

How many of them had their starting QBs, or a QB of the caliber of Watson?

&gt;three of them back to back

For all we know, most of those teams' rankings could be a sham, given that they really weren't challenged at all until they each played each other.


&gt;South Carolina fan

Ohh, now I get it.In week 1, literally the Thursday kickoff game for this season. People need to stop putting so much stock in that SCar/UNC game. Marquise has since found his game, as that single performance does not accurately reflect his abilities.He's gonna need a golf cart, too.Entirely debatable. I'd say it's somewhere around 5, tops.I don't bet.Luatua is the best blocker at TE for the run game (a loss that was clearly evident against Clemson), over Smythe. Smythe was kind of both, but better as guy catching the ball...when they actually decide to throw to the TEs.

My concern with Jarron is him coming back with his legs not at full strength.FAVORITES:

Just like you're saying your defense was hampered simply because of a job offer, ours was actually quite physically hampered (although LSU had a few out, too). Combine a proper relatively uninjured ND defense with the game plan coming in, and it's not likely a close game at all. You also needed a special teams play (Fournette's return) and a trick play (double pass, IIRC) just to keep it close as it was, so your offense wasn't exactly doing anything terribly amazing, although they did very well for the limited time ND provided them.This post has no premise unless he's actually a helo pilot.https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQnnxlaTn544SO8hsSeu2XCgx90=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2526926/saban.0.gifBREAKING: Saban retiring effective immediately ^^^/s[Hopefully people cheer against ND, we win, and we get another one of these.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVZJmnDvfkM)I see you're at least a little familiar with ND Football.They like to talk about how they lead the series over ND.

Just sayin'. Still a good story.Bro, this was already posted yesterday,

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3vl1qj/brett_greenwood_source_of_inspiration_for_iowa/No problem! Just pointing it out. :pFuck it, let's do bowl games upon bowl games until spring practice starts.Oh no, it fucking flew by. I swear to god it's absurd how fast this season went. I have no idea, but I think someone fucked with the space-time continuum.[What I think.](http://www.russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/please-no-more.gif)Oh no, I said it earlier this year and people defended him a fair amount saying how physically gifted this year was. While I agree they are physically capable, my concern is the tendons of these players who are bulking up muscle-wise but the ligaments not being able to keep up with their strength.NOOOOOOO!

In all seriousness, hope his football future is bright.Another transfer QB for UGA. This could be very good or...not so good. I will say I do think Towles is a pretty good QB in general.This smells like a letter of openness.Well, LSU does.Well, honestly I think that the focus is on building muscle, and they're not focusing on the integrity of their tendons and perhaps their flexibility, which may have nothing to do with adding nutritional supplements, but perhaps either lessening the muscle building proteins a bit and/or changing up the workout routines. All sorts of options, I'd say. But I'm just positing that is the issue, without much to go on.*while barkingI just...what the hell. It's not like Iowa was completely outclassed on the field or anything.Kirk Herbstreit is still on ESPN, so that's nice.&gt;but I think that if Michigan State and Ohio State played again that Ohio State would win

You mean with MSU playing with backup O'Connor again, or with Connor Cook back? Cause MSU already beat them once with the backup.

&gt;They weren't themselves in their loss to Michigan State, in my opinion.

See what I just said above. MSU weren't themselves either given Cook not playing.

&gt;When both teams are firing on all cylinders I think Ohio State is the better team and can go toe-to-toe with anyone. 

This is such a ridiculously generic statement/thought that gets thrown around all the time, but it lacks substance. Yeah, any top 10 team, for the most part, SHOULD be able to "go toe-to-toe" with anyone.*shrugs*

I mean, it goes both ways is all I'm saying. Everyone can have bad nights play-calling, but ultimately it still comes down to HOW to execute those play calls. The opposing team doesn't KNOW what those play calls are coming into each series, so it's not like they've got all the answers handed to them. Obviously, yes, you can make inferences depending on how a team lines up, earlier series' tendencies, etc. But that again, goes both ways.

Just like if OSU's play calling may have been an issue, so would MSU's have been, given O'Connor not having as diverse of a playbook available as Cook might have had.What?&gt;with the offense

http://i.imgur.com/Ufbr5ej.gif&gt;If you were confused on how anyone could argue JMU has a better football program, I can't help you there.

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm confused about. Are you actually saying that JMU is potentially a better program?Yeah, VT is better. It's that simple. I just saw your little conversation in /r/nfl in that postgame thread. (I like to know who the f I'm talking to sometimes so I go see if I can nail down where they are coming from)

I found your problem:

/r/nflTo be fair, Mariota HAD to win last year, because he didn't get the benefit of the doubt the year prior, even though he measured up to Winston in almost every way. Much of that was possible *because* of people not watching their games. That said, before FSU fans go nuts, Winston definitely deserved it for what he did on the field, too. Just saying that Mariota killed it that year too and was more than deserving, but didn't get as much coverage as FSU.Or, you know, you could just link the article and not editorialize the fuck out of the title.I love this kind of stuff.&gt; like Kizer who's first start came at Clemson.

Well, he started for GT and UMASS, too. His first *full away* game was @Clemson though, which is what I think you meant anyway.

Just noting this for clarification.Watch all of those fucking games be at 730/8pm ET. God fucking dammit.Can't wait.If you can slow him down/stop him, you have a solid chance of winning. Just so long as you cover the middle of the fucking field.Well deserved.Clemson bias.I've said it before, but as far as overall football capabilities for their position, Oakman is highly overrated and Billings is criminally underrated. But, given the preseason hype having literally nothing to do with Oakman's actual playing ability, he got all the attention. He is physically very impressive, but that's about it, and that's what drove the campaign behind him. Any tackle worth their salt in top echelon of CFB or in the NFL doesn't even need help on a double team him as long as they have leverage, which they all will with his height/weight distribution being what it is.

Completely off the top of my head, but given his athletic prowess, if he had the coordination and hands, he could end up playing a ridiculously tall TE maybe.ClemluminatiBeen under a rock, have you.ND's rush defense is pretty damned impressive at times, regardless of the stat ranking somewhere in the middle of the pack. And plus, we get two veterans back that we haven't had basically all year (TE Durham Smythe, went out after game 2 @UVA, and DT Jarron Jones, out all season) as well as potentially OLB Onwulau and RB Prosise, all four of which are players we didn't have for Stanford.I'll just miss Brent and his "this is for all the Tostitos".I think ND has a solid shot, IF they're well-prepared. I think looking at the UM/OSU game is pointless. ND's offensive unit is far superior to UM's in pretty much every single way, top to bottom, so I'm not worried about them limiting that UM unit to so few points. Most importantly, it can't be stressed enough how superior ND's OL is compared to UM's, which will give Kizer time in the passing game. Even when they struggled at Clemson, the pass pro was amazing against a then-very-solid front 7 (before Boulware and a couple other Clemson defenders had issues later this year). That said, I do still expect pressure and a sack or two from Bosa/Lewis/Lee/Perry from the edge.

Defensively, ND struggles with the secondary, although I think it's remotely possible that losing KVR at CB could be a blessing in disguise as I think Devin Butler will stick on his man better (along with IIRC Nick Coleman helping a bit, too), a problem KVR has had all year randomly. As far as stopping the run, Sheldon Day busts plays up before they even get started, and I think OSU, as with most other teams this year, will struggle  just barely enough at times to contain him that it causes problems. Also don't be shocked when you see Shumate come up from the safety position to stop the run or on a pass rush. Another thing ND does is shuffle that DL around to get Day on the outside and place Rochell/Cage (or Tillery) in the middle, and with he and Cage's size, it plugs up the holes so you either force a RB into Day's hands or he goes the other way and finds himself facing Jaylon. Throw Jarron Jones back into the mix, and if he's ready to go, that could help make a big difference in how well the middle of the DL plugs things up, fresh legs and all.

There are all sorts of ways this can go down, and getting blown out isn't completely out of my mind, but I'd be surprised if this team didn't deliver an effort that allows them a chance to win the game. Honestly, if they're worried about the points OSU can put up, they can take the same/similar approach they did last year against Fournette, win the TOP battle, and with a run game like ND has had recently, they should be capable of doing just that.

The main concern above all else though, as has been all year, is whether or not ND can score TDs in the red zone.LEAVE KEN ALONE! He belongs at Navy.My what a fragile fandom you have.I'm gonna need the 10 hour rendition of Rocky Top (w/ Down the Field mixed in of course).Was his draft stock not that great if he were to leave this year? Most of the projections I can find are for 2017 anyway.Army shouldn't, but I'd say BYU probably should. Lumping the two together seems kind of silly, frankly.Check out BYU's early schedule this year, though. They're making changes to allow a CFP run IF they manage to roll through undefeated.

And now look at 2016's.Between UM and UGA, they both really need to find a QB pipeline so they're not just trying to shoe-in transfer after transfer.Hard to classify? Who cares? Shuffle them all up in whatever order you want, and it's still a tough schedule. Focusing solely on the last couple games is silly.They've basically had the same running back since Saban's arrival. I wouldn't be worried if I were them.And at least two of those P5 teams are a joke right now, in ISU and Kansas.

I'd put G5s Boise State, Toledo, USU, and Cincy above both of those EASILY as of right now.And Toledo, they're 9-2 FFS. (With a cancelled game against Stony Brook they most likely would have won.)What about lake effect snowflakes?&gt;Notre Dame - Brian Kelly - $1.2 

*chuckles*

Where did you even get this? Oh, I see it now. I don't think these numbers are remotely up to date right now, frankly, because I think publicly BK is over 2M right now.&gt;Absolutely out of your mind if you think Utah State is as good as ISU.

That's your opinion.

&gt;And you said easily better lol no chance

The "easily" I meant for all of them as a group, but I'd say that USU might have the toughest time with ISU out of the four I listed.

&gt;Boise State would probably lose to ISU as well.

I mean, anything's possible.It's not. There's more on top of that which isn't public. That's just his public salary, given ND being private.http://i.imgur.com/M4vuO.gifThat's awesome.

&gt;ACC, Big Ten, Pac-12, SEC, or Notre Dame.

Time for another series with OU!To be fair to Baylor, they are a victim right now of their past when they weren't very good (read: terrible). So now that they're good, a lot of the teams on their schedule were put on there to help get them some wins a while back. Over time, it'll get better.&gt; Do we have to play the big 12 every year to make y'all happy?

Yes, now go play TTU. Now. ^^^/sSounds good to me.This was discussed initially when the alcoholism first came out.Because it's the only way big historic programs can talk about their greatness.

Trap set. Also, no more Tommy Rees handing you the game.Yeah, fuck all that. Seriously.Wouldn't have been in the red zone without all those picks. :3

Yeah, they definitely have been much more competitive under Fitz than I remember with Walker or Barnett.Picked Perine for Heisman. (honestly, I would have picked Watson, but I had no idea how he'd respond coming back from injury at the time, which he did quite well)

Best defensive player: Jaylon Smith/KeiVarae (honestly, Jaylon most likely deserves to take it, biased)

Conf Winners: picked MSU, yay, missed on the ACC (FSU), SEC (Arky, lol), B12 (TCU, who may have if they didn't have all the injuries), and PAC12 (USC, who at least made the CCG). Man, fucking injuries devastated some of this shit.

CFP: OSU, Arky, TCU, ND :'(

Champ: OSU or ND (meaning we'd be in the final, so close)

Biggest bust: Clemson or GT (nailed GT, Clemson rolled well with their player losses from last year)My TCU and ND picks for the CFP were devastated by injuries, lol.Hear that A&amp;M and Mizzou? Pack your shit!&gt;fraternity 

Sounds about right.&gt; I wouldn't be surprised to see them get caught

And hopefully booted and thrown in jail.&gt;When i was in college a girl got raped in their house, they were going to be shut down, and a few alumni withdrew their pledges to the school and magically they were reopened

What. the. fuck.Nope, very familiar with it though.I would know that generalizing anything is bad. It was a three word comment, dude. But there's a reason why greek life as a whole gets a bad name.Words, actually.Sounds like they could use better oversight of the organization as a whole...

[Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.](https://media.giphy.com/media/G1Zu26ae7mZr2/giphy.gif)In my mind a "mini brawl" is more of a shoving match, a couple fists, and everyone walks away.

These fuckers broke into his vehicle, vandalized it, surrounded him with allegedly up to 15 dudes (you know, because they're so cool and tough...that none of them have the balls to do shit on their own), then put him in the hospital.&gt; They could have easily not been in a frat and would have still been assholes, you know? 

True.

&gt;They don't make people dicks. 

While that is also True, any specific environment of like-minded influences/individuals CAN make others act a certain way, especially if you have that safety in numbers going on, which they clearly did in this situation. Not saying this just applies to fraternities, though.No matter what they're targeting, 15 vs 2 could lead to death.Right, we're all currently going solely off of the information provided in the article.&gt;Brent Musburger to announce Rose Bowl

I am so excited.

What the fuck, he's not with Herbie? What is this shit?!

Brent + Jessie is NOT a proper pairing. He belongs with Herbstreit, period.

edit: I'm well aware where Brent is currently.No excuses. Brent + Herbie.Martini is killing it right now as the opposite OLB, IMO.Welp, time to return and win a defensive Heisman next year.

Jaylon pls.[Excuse me, pardon me, coming through, important Ole Miss business.](http://www.barcelonafootballblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bag-of-money.jpg)&gt;True freshman talent aren't gonna be able to step in and be as good as senior talent

I disagree. :pI think it wasn't immediately following that, but I honestly could be wrong.Holds up a "1" in a picture and suddenly he's "definitely not that tolerable of a person".^^Not ^^a ^^smartphone, ^^that's ^^for ^^sure.Very good. Once again, BK is pulling in top OL recruits (Kraemer and Eichenberg, plus Boudreax), and we've seen what kind of an impact that can have this year. Romeo Okwara's brother, Julian, is coming in as a DE along with Khalid Kareem, and ND is bringing in two safeties, which is VERY nice to have. Sanford also managed to pull in Ian Book, a kid he was recruiting when he was at BSU, too.I'm not sure how you're gleaning anything about his overall character from a single photo, is all I'm saying. Yes, there are always two sides to every story.Sadly my Samsung Galaxy-quality posts will never live up to expectations.[&gt;:(](http://i.imgur.com/GZ0Kaa0.gif)And then, ND would be playing UM in the Fiesta Bowl? So they still kinda fucked up, right?Uh, what?Well IF this is True..that certainly changes some things, especially how I feel about this whole situation.Wasn't a PAC12 crew.Welcome to the offseason. It'll be Snyder Central around here before long, whether he retires or not.I think that was just this past season, against GT's slot WR off the top of my head, unless that's what you meant.Cowboys have gotten enough ND players to help them out. Jaylon needs to go to Chicago to help the rebuild of that trademark Bears Defense.Like I said, that's enough. :pYour headline is basically "Ellis Johnson physically present on SC's staff."

I find that amusing.Honestly, not exactly sure what the competition for this award might have been anyway. I know there are a few, I think Utah has one guy, off the top of my head.You really are a funny guy.Slim chance. I've remained adamant that I don't bet, because I don't want to jinx anything. It's weird, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see.Hah, same to you. Let's hope it's at least a good game and no bad things happen!Shaq Lawson is goddamned impressive, but you guys really enjoy posting this single clip as if it's suddenly evidence that he "couldn't handle him" at all throughout the course of the game. It's one play. Anyone can make a guy look bad in a couple single instances. Yes, this one play though was just silly with the way they were dragging him down.

Since Nelson (56) was still in for this clip (who went down in IIRC the 1st quarter and was out for the rest of the game after that), one can infer that this would have been very early in the game, too, and Stanley's first action he saw after a leg injury that kept him out for basically the entire 2nd half the week prior (guy fell onto the back of his leg) against UMASS. Watch ND's pass protection throughout most of the full game and tell me that they "can't handle him". He was actually kept in check for what's safe to say was the majority of the game.

3.

ND, MSU, Vols.ND/MSU - alums in family/multitude of close friends, since birth.

Vols - totally random after seeing how impressive Neyland was when ND went down there back around 2000. After that I just kinda started liking them.Drink up, half pint.Holy fucking shitballs.Yay facemask. /sPlease no.NO CATCH


JUGGLEWatch this take half an hour to review it.YES!Please Bears...please....66 yards....what the fuck. That's....has that ever been made before?Absolutely terrible. What a ridiculous rant. Just stop it, Dabo.

^^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^cannot ^^^^^^^^^confirm ^^^^^^^^^or ^^^^^^^^^deny ^^^^^^^^^if ^^^^^^^^^that's ^^^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^^^why ^^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^truly ^^^^^^^^^feel.Barning.I'm scared.I liked it too. But, this is brand new, so you can't compare it to the old cast's version. This is like people crying about how great Jon Stewart was, so Travor obviously sucks. The show is in its infancy.Every opponent on ND's schedule could cause trouble every week, especially teams like PITT, BC, Purdue, etc. They've always been problematic at times when they "weren't expected to be great".

I'm just *really* familiar with my team's ability to give others a chance.Hah. We'll see if that helps.I can't find that line anywhere in the article. Are you paraphrasing something?Any thread about them eventually has the word thrown around. It's kind of absurd. Any loss they might have or have incurred means they obviously "Clemsoned". It didn't use to be this bad here, but this is also what comes with higher sub membership numbers, as the typical quality of conversation you'd find on the other boards finds its way onto /r/CFB.Seems like the worst possible week for this to be going on....ND/USC week.Bottled directly from the source?I mean, I'd be surprised if he were fired already. I'm assuming that's just overreaction and this is just typical twitter "news".You'll have to forgive him. Ohio State fans literally have no clue what it means to struggle for even a couple years.Nope. When it's in South Bend, it's in the middle of the year. When it's out there, it's at the end of the year. This has been going on for ages (at least most of my life, IIRC).

AKA USC is afraid of the cold. :pAll of our opponents we've beaten have been screwing us, so far. The unexpected one would be Texas delivering against OU.....this is a one line tweet with zero details.I dunno, they may be too salty.They were still feeling the effect of scholarship shortages, too. Kind of a big deal. In the next two years, though, whoever is coaching there, Sark or otherwise, will have a wealth of talent.Shit...No, it's obviously because you are afraid of the cold.

Although what you said makes sense.Most leaders in any realm of influence surround themselves with smarter people than themselves. You'd never learn anything if you didn't.Sucks for the schools who can't really stand to battle it out.I'm probably wrong, but I think that's some sort of snap interference.You mean the OL where Tuerk, their Center and best OL, went down in the first quarter?Celebrate "Survival".Good enough to ruin my day when ND plays them.He can't answer too much anyway right now, given how fresh this all is. Is there something I'm missing?Watch him come back to ND Football on NBC.What also sucks is he was a very high draft prospect, too.Same here. No idea what to expect from USC for ND or Michigan for MSU.Damn, that was quick. He was pretty high on ND as well, along with UM.

Also, he's a 4-star in the 247 composite, which is what we use on /r/CFB.I'm not sold on that with UM being up there...and with the way you've been playing recently.Weird, not according to the profile for UM, but who knows. I just think with the way UM has been playing that HAS to help them a bit with him as well. And I'm sure Harbaugh's staff isn't exactly going to just "leave him alone", or at least I'd be surprised.

Then again, since he's opening up the recruiting again, he could decide to just go in a different direction completely, who knows.Is it the Shamrock or the Golden Dome that tells them to run the "fumble the football" play?I refuse to get my hopes up. He'd certainly fill a hole with Jaylon potentially leaving after this year. Then again....if Smith decided to stay for his senior year, oh my god.I vaguely remember something about that, what was the injury issue again?Ouch. Kinda sucks for a guy that needs to hit people to have a shoulder injury/issues like that. Wonder why he got that high of a rating, given that factor.It's almost like many people only look for calls that were missed that might have benefited their team.Both of my flairs be like: \u0ca0_\u0ca0[CFB Injury Report](http://www.donbest.com/ncaaf/injuries/)I'm worried the ND/BC game will resemble the 2012 game where it's like 20-3 or something really low scoring.True that they've very done well so far. However, I think you have yet to play the best offenses you'll see this year. The Clemson game will definitely tell us a lot.&gt;Aug 10, 2015

I'm assuming OP was just linking this to pose the question.Not.

He's doing a great job, and I feel like UGA could end up shooting themselves in the foot if they fire him "in the hopes" that they get someone better. Then they could end up with a situation like Mike Riley at Nebraska or Sark at USC, basically a situation where you think to yourself "we didn't think this through".I think most of those UGA fans don't seem to realize that they are not a "destination program" in the same sense as many others. So, the likelihood of them hitting a home run and getting a coach that can deliver *better* than what Richt is already doing is at least somewhat slim.Fiesta vs Boise State.

Please no.I've actually been thinking about that matchup possibility for a while. I'd love to see how they handle the Clemson secondary.Starters: 

QB Malik Zaire - out for season

RB Tarean Folston - out for season

TE Durham Smythe - out for season

DT Jarron Jones - out for season

NB Shaun Crawford - out for season

Backups:

S Drue Tranquill - out for season, started against GT

S Avery Sebastian - ? but may be coming back for this next game (no longer on injury report)

---

Honestly, I think we could have done fine with the others out, but Malik going down has put the biggest hampering on the offense, and overall team and their attitude, IMO.That or a rematch with Clemson, even though I know it won't happen.Isn't that the same as what he basically said? Did you mean to say "what if we're just a decent team"?That or a rematch, pls. :'''(We already stole one guy, might as well take Bryan off your hands and add him to the ND staff. :pTennessee is remotely possible if Butch doesn't make a turn starting now, and they can come up with that kind of cash, too.If BK leaves, I would not be opposed to this.

Hey, maybe that's what the whole trip for that ND/Clemson game was actually for! /sLook at you with your non-season-ending injuries. Lucky bastards.Alcoholism isn't really that simple.STILL haven't played four quarters since the fucking Texas game.

Speaking of that, so far after this weekend, Texas just made themselves to look like the highest-quality win ND has had all year. Fucking Texas!&gt; JOSH \u201cAEROSPACE\u201d DOBBS

As a Vols fan as well, this is great.*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*Honest question, how many quarters did he play?Ah okay. I had no idea, truthfully.We kinda need to win, too, and....the 2nd half of our schedule looks rougher than the 1st half...with Temple, PITT, and at least BC's defense...and maybe Stanford.Well shit.Sanford seems to be doing amazing work in the QB coaching department. It's been put to the test this year already, too, sadly.Trigger warning, don't scroll through to the next article.

I need to go break things now.I'm sure BK forgot to think to himself "I have to please all the Clemson message board fans" before he said that. He most likely meant best Navy defense since he's been at ND.I doubt that. If so, that would be insane levels of inferiority complex, and Clemson already has a fair amount of it, somewhat understandably given some of the treatment by media, etc.He's part of a three-man team. Sanford, Denbrock, and BK all collaborate on play-calling duties. Frankly, you'd think it would fuck everything up, but they've all attested that it's amazing how well they work together.I like how this is written before the actual game between the two takes place.Possibly. But if he's part of a team that makes the CFP, which initially was looking like a possibility before all the injuries this year, then he'd have a bigger check mark on his resume. I think that was kind of the way it was maybe looked at.

Another possibility is that he considered being closer to his father at Indiana State, as well as the remote possibility that perhaps he saw BK leaving in a year or two, as others have considered as a projection. So perhaps he thought it could wait it out, and, if he delivered enough success, found himself in at least a Asst. HC position at ND, hoping to jump into the driver's seat as HC in 5-6 years? I dunno, just spit-balling ideas.

All sorts of possibilities, really. I'd say that even if he were looking to jump to a HC position in a couple years, both the money and the name of ND over BSU definitely increases his stock, though, no insult to BSU.No way this is going to be that big of a win. No way, none at all, nope.

^^^pls.I'm pretty sure all their players read TigerNet exclusively. /sWhile I can dream, this defense for MSU just isn't the same as the past few years. We'll see, though. Anything can happen when you hit the field.I'm not that overconfident. Their offense was also a bit hampered at times, too.I would love nothing more than to derail the "omg three shutouts" train.You look normal again, so that's nice.That guy's reaction is great. It's like when Bill Burr goes ".....well fuck it then..."Angry typing definitely helps. Can confirm.Child-like me: Wait....do they really do that in Texas if you just yell it out like that?I think your struggles as the game wears on also really comes down to the line depth you have, or lack thereof, not just letting the foot off the gas. Your skill positions are beautiful, but when the lines are playing a full game and you can't rely on the 2nd string to take some pressure off at times (especially defensively), your starters eventually get taken advantage of both with fatigue and the other team starting to recognize tendencies.

This is just what happens especially during halftime when the other team gets their ducks in a row, especially after adjusting to the environment. As far as your defense, the other team making adjustments especially helps when they know you can't throw a 2nd string defensive front at them like you had last year that gives some different looks at new guys with fresh legs. Most of Clemson's 2nd string defense last year could basically start at most schools. The same can't be really said for too many on that 2nd defense this year.He would have been RB3 anyway. Prosise was already taking 2nd team reps in the fall prior to the season starting, and so far Adams IMO would have replaced him at RB3 easily after a couple games in. Greg was a highly-rated bust, that I myself was REALLY excited about, and he's proven that with both his play on the field and his attitude. He had one great kick return that had everyone excited along with a few runs, but I'm not sold that that would have been the norm. And, Sanders is already seemingly delivering more consistently on kick returns/punts IMO, when he gets the blocking anyway.Losing Tuerk is probably going to suck for SC considering now his replacement (Rodgers, I think) has to contend with Tillery and Day. Should be interesting to see how often ND can blow up the middle and get a LB in there on a blitz, which BVG will definitely do.By beating OU, I guess.That...seems like the opposite of the best thing for UCF's football team.I think the weather limited both teams' abilities, so I'm not so convinced as to say ND would have won simply because of that.Never underestimate BK's ability to outcoach himself, too.Speaking to that talent, Ronald Jones is going to be tough to stop, no matter what they do. Luckily ND recruited him as well, so they're at least somewhat familiar with his abilities.Clemson's DL destroying ND's OL early on is what put a stop to that. It was really uncharacteristic of the ND OL, but they just weren't prepared early on for what Clemson has up front. They got it down a little later in the game, but early on with fresh legs, their DL was killing it.Relevant: ND hasn't played 4 quarters since the Texas game.You and yer silly conferences. 

:''(This makes no sense and it was amazing.Oh my god...my sides.[Harbaugh, obviously.](http://i.imgur.com/biDFHU0.gif)Nope, just Artavis Scott.

He's terrible. /s

Oh, and the 10 other WRs they have.HEY MARK, THEY SAID MSU WILL BE A CAKE WALK!!!!! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?! TELL THEM SATURDAY ON THE FIELD!

I think he heard me.[Yes, it will. Look into these eyes.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvVzNdOiVOM/maxresdefault.jpg)This is great. Hoping to make an LSU home game soon myself. I'm pretty sure I won't be able to handle all the liquor they throw around down there, at least anymore with my current tolerance levels being reduced.I just realized I only recognize him by his first name "Ifo".I'm just not up to LSU-level tolerance.YEEEEAAAAAHHH!

Frankly, I'm getting worried about our DL, though, after Day and Okwara leave.Congrats on that.He just looks like a child throwing a temper tantrum there.I think Folston would have better luck running than Prosise did against Clemson specifically, if he wasn't out, just because of his style of running, coupled with his blocking abilities with are far superior to any of the current active RBs.

Plus the QB run with Malik would have been a far bigger threat than it was with Kizer. It's a whole different offense, IMO, if Malik is there.

Jarron Jones coupled with Day up front would have been a far bigger disruption than the current DL was, even though Tillery and Cage have been decent in his stead.

Luatua was ND's best blocking TE, and he was out for that game, and it showed in a big way for the run game.

Smythe was also missed at TE, both for his blocking and also receiving abilities.Not that you mentioned him, but Norton being out was a godsend, as Guillermo is an upgrade from him.

Wiggins, Williams, and Reader were certainly losses, but that's 3 compared to ND's 5-6, one of which is the starting QB...kind of a big deal...still having to explain this to Clemson fans blows my mind.

Tell me Clemson would have won without Watson. One of the scores, the QB TD run after the 2nd half kickoff fumble, never would have happened.

You'd have to actually understand how ND's offense has now changed with Kizer at the helm compared to Malik to see what has changed, but I doubt you do.

And my 5-6 figure is leaving out Tranquill who proved himself against GT especially.Never said that he wasn't. But, you're seemingly saying that you're refusing to acknowledge what having a *True* dual threat does for an offense? It's an absolute game-changer by diversifying the offensive options/approach.

edit: Put Schuess in the game and tell me you get that Watson TD run with a straight face.Literally. :(Right, you are entitled to your opinion, but that displays the lack of a fundamental understanding as to how the QB run/read option changes the entire defensive approach (Watson being in there isn't just a threat because of his passing, also because of the way he can run the ball). Instead of a DL getting into the backfield and busting the RB alone, he and the others now have to stay honest and account for the QB pulling the ball and running himself (also with part of the onus being on the LBs). Not having to account for Kizer running like Malik made it easy to key on Prosise. It's a whole different game. This comes with an understanding of how the read-option works, which they cannot run anywhere near as efficiently with Kizer at the helm, although they still do run it from time to time and he does *okay*.

Stanley had a minor leg injury that probably hampered him from the UMass game (he went down at the half and didn't see much if any action in the 3rd and 4th quarters, IIRC), and again having the blocking of Luatua at TE out definitely helped your DL bust some run plays up. They played their asses off, don't get me wrong.

&gt;Shaq Lawson was in the backfield almost every snap and when he wasn't, he was held quite a bit  holding was rarely called on both sides, which was odd to me seeing as how both ND and CU held badly

As far as the holding, it keeps coming up that Lawson was held. I'm betting if I spent all my time looking for it, ND's DL was probably held on numerous occasions as well, but you're not really looking for Clemson holding ND, are you? (I can usually admit my bias. Can you?) Last I checked, ND wasn't the team saying "the refs better let us play". I'd say they were more likely consistent with both teams.

I agree that Kizer did a great job, but it's still True that with Malik it's just not the same offense and there are more options to defend.[Satire]You know this is satire, right? Please say "no" so I can laugh at you.1 Disrespect Added = +10 point margin of victory for MSU.

Am I doing this right?Looks like Michigan fans didn't come to play school today.The "Satire" notice was literally in the beginning of the article. So, how much did you read? Aside from none?I think most(?) of the fourth was with our backups, so I'm not sure.I'd say it means "inferiority complex". As of right now, I *do* think they deserve a top 4-5 billing, though.

This is probably just some master plan by Dabo to get them riled up. :pAnd they'd probably be wrong, because it'll be to a good opponent like FSU or whatever. The definition now has just gone on to mean "Clemson lost a game", instead of the original intended joke. Plus, on top of that, it's just old and busted at this point and needs to stay on the other shit forums across the internet instead of permeating the conversation of /r/CFB.

You realize everyone is waiting for certain teams to lose just so they can yell "told you so!" all over right now, right? OSU, ND again, Clemson, Alabama again, every major named team.Uhh, okay.Only tears now.Can we do it without a monsoon this time?Soonering. Get it right.Love that guy. /sHow bout that second flair of yours!THAT WAS RHETORICAL, MONSOON DENIED!No you wouldn't, nobody would.Uhh, wait, we can have Watson?HURRICANE WAS IN THE OCEAN, IT WAS A MONSOON.I'm not even sure where to begin on that KSU/TCU game. What the fuck.I think they just looked at the weather and just went "fuckit" and let everything unfold just to get out of there sooner, lol. Sucks because I really would have liked to see this game played without the weather and both teams at full strength.I'm pretty sure BK was kinda the same at one point later in the game last year. I think we really need this game back, if not just for the potential angry coach shenanigans.Welcome to every sports conversation ever.Ouch.More like Sleep Forest.The rational ones expected like 6-8 wins this year. With these shutouts, he's already delivered more than they can believe.You're going to call the guy you already gave the finger to?I'll just leave [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n1KPQmdddY) here.[Hey...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOpNKOK6i0)Russell Athletic Bowl win it is...Yep, Baylor and ND basically returned the most players this past offseason.Which is something they're working on for the future. Current schedules are decided years in advance, like ND scheduling UGA for 17 and 19 and OSU for like 2022 or whatever.

Just like SEC OOC scheduling is also getting better.Too bad nobody uses it correctly.I forgot this one was on Thursday. I can't wait to see this./r/titlegoreThis is what happens when I retire my pitchforking business.Jimbo's a cool dude.Seriously, last year was a clusterfuck of blame from Jimbo down to all the random FSU flairs on the subreddit.Wat.TIL Bert is James Harden.Welp.The hope is he'll get clean/sober and have a great comeback story. Sure, perhaps not at SC, but who knows?Watch him go to the NFL in a couple years.Not too many big names available right now that I can think of.Knee and shoulder injuries got him around the UVA game, out for season.This might actually be the only "home run hire" they can make right now. Other than that, I can't think of anyone else "available" that USC could pull, especially at this point. It's possible, I guess, that they let things ride until the end of the year where things become a bit clearer. And, frankly, I don't see Chip leaving.No, Joey Freshwater.Oh my god, no, please.I'd be surprised if he leaves TCU. Financially and recruiting-wise, he's in a very similar situation to SC. Great program support and a great recruiting state.NO!Yeah. Hoping he recovers and everything works out. Sucks because he's a great player overall. I had a feeling you were asking for a reason like this. :pObviously, endowment-wise, USC something-like triples TCU. But still as a football program, I think TCU pretty much has the financial backing to roll with almost anyone in the country. It depends on how far out on that limb USC is willing to go, which can only be assumed to be pretty far, and the timing of it as well. That said, as another factor, TCU has just done a fair amount of building of new facilities, etc. so that helps potentially keep Patterson there as well.I have no idea, but that doesn't ring any bells for me with the Vols' job. Perhaps he was mentioned randomly, though.http://i.imgur.com/EqgJ626.gifWithout the crystal footballs.I wonder if Harbaugh misses Cali? :(I feel like this is the only reason he suggested them, choosing to leave it up to someone else to complete it.Well shit. That saddens me.Were you also UCLA's #1 fan against ASU? Because this just might backfire on you.Yeah, he's reported and looked to be a hard hitter. Hoping that he's back on the field from here on out and we see a little bit of that.Dress adequately. You're not cool because you can "take the cold". It'll probably be just above freezing, according to the forecast, so the earlier game will be warmer, but don't be fooled. By the time 1030 or whatever rolls around, it's cold as fuck. Also says "few showers" possible, so take something waterproof.The watery crap is nothing like the ND Hot Chocolate of old.Given ND's past experience with this, TCU, I can say that at least you're building valuable depth for next year when completely different starters go down.I could go the rest of my life without seeing that idiot's face.Well, Strong just beat an undefeated top 10 OU team, their biggest rival, too. It's Strong.That getup he's wearing looks familiar. I don't like this one bit.Okay, the Vols fan in me still says Strong. UGA/Vols are typically close games, but they're not direct rivals, and UGA hadn't really played anyone yet before they met Bama (no offense to UGA), and it showed. Meanwhile, OU had already beaten two then-ranked teams coming into the RRS, Vols and WVU, and had a generally more impressive slate up until this past game.

Maybe that makes more sense.

edit: actually, let me clarify, UGA and Vols are considered "rivals" in some circles, but that's nothing like their GT or UF rivalries, and nothing like the RRSNot sure if talking shit about Texas or your own team.Shit...My god, Temple is going to potentially be 7-0 when ND goes out there. That is a bit scary.Back the fuck off, asshats.I imagine Swarbrick would do everything to prevent such a move.[Notre Dame Athletics Department right now](https://memecrunch.com/image/51ecc4b3afa96f24f1000001.jpg)Great read, but my reaction would be...same old story: just keep winning and stop caring what other people think. When you lose, you confirm a lot of people's biases."Don't know what you have until it's gone" applies here.When you're not a "destination program" (no offense) and you have a coach delivering the record Richt is with relative regularity in one of the toughest conferences, it would be silly to throw your hat in the ring "just because". Firing Richt with his record as of late would also be a red flag for coaches to avoid that place, too, if they were even considering it.I agree that it would be a very attractive job opening, but like I said...if you fire a dude who has the record Richt has had as of late...that's also a massive check mark in the negative column which makes prospective takers think twice.I'd say it's literally right on the outskirts. It's a GOOD HC gig, but it doesn't hold a candle to quite a few, I'd say, and is certainly not a blue blood...which is also the way I'm **partly** thinking of this. I'd say a job Oregon as a non-blue blood would even have a leg-up on them, with all that Nike help, too. Plus again, firing a guy with Richt's record puts a check in the minus column and makes coaches question the place a little bit, at least.I don't disagree with any of this.That's...not really relevant. And the answer is no, although I'm hoping to correct that soon.It's like the plight of Nebraska with Bo Pelini. Not stellar, but good seasons overall nonetheless. It's risky as hell when you fire a guy for being "not great", but then have to go with an unknown commodity. And then you may end up with your own 2-3 coach string of failures which may cause more harm than good. So it all depends on how things shake out with current openings and how they should time the UGA job coming open. If they do it this year or next, they could be contending with USC, next year potentially Texas if Strong doesn't deliver, Miami with Golden, all sorts of possibilities that might make it that much harder to get their "ideal candidate" when contending with programs with just as much or more pull.~~I think 2017~~ 2019 is in Athens. Ideally, that's what I'm hoping to make it down for. I'll have my bark-shield up. :p

edit: nope, 2019 in AthensSomething tells me there has to be much better "theater" coming out of the South.

And frankly, you seem to be excluding New Orleans jazz, which is a performance art form in it's own league.Miami with a fresh face and energy around the program will sell itself, IMO.

Use less coke, though.Absolutely.Well, Arkansas State is playing on Tuesday night, Gus came from there....sooo...that means something right?I mean, you could have actually lost to Jacksonville St. So there's your bright side.Fuck, don't tell /r/gaming.Personally, I'd like to know the perfect candidate that USC can get which will have them go 11-1 every year, with an annual loss to ND but a shutout of UCLA.Houston and Cincy are in the same boat there.Good, been waiting to hear about him coming back.Cmon, it'll be fun.This isn't surprising if you understand enough about Purdue Football. It's just what they do.What a coincidence...Anyone else leaves like this and half of /r/CFB would be losing their collective shit about how big of a dick move it was.Can't catch a break lately with those streaks.You can't hire yourself and your NCAA14 experience doesn't count.I will trade your records over the past decade.I'm okay with those bastards not operating where they can injure any more players.Now that Sark is out, literally all sights are on Haden. I wonder if he didn't see this coming.Now in the middle of the season it's going to be a month full of "OMG remember when Spurrier said...". Exactly what I was afraid of.

Commerce with the circlejerk.

edit: ..and downvotes of course for anyone who doesn't conform. Don't forget to hit up my entire profile page and get a couple pages at a time like some of you asshats have been doing.

edit2: to clarify, I'm not shitting on his actual career accomplishments, it would just be preferable to not have everything discussed  be about what he said and avoid his actual career accomplishments at multiple different programs. I give myself zero points for execution...and may god have mercy on my soul.I absolutely have the utmost respect for what his teams did on the field. Half of what he's celebrated for has nothing to do with that, though. That's what's frustrating.My god. What is this shit.I wasn't intending for that above to "Noneify" his accomplishments, in fact quite the contrary. I feel the exact same about his Duke, UF, and SCar tenures. His accomplishments are far more important than the "quotables" people refer to, which is what I meant...although my delivery was...poor at this hour.Well at least you're clean now.I wouldn't care if it didn't drive the conversation, and if you don't agree with the masses it skews the conversation. When a sub grows larger, as /r/CFB has in the recent years, it gets worse.

Even just a genuine observation/question of a program/thing that is "against a specific thread" gets hit if you don't praise them to kingdom come in the process. It's just that over the last ~3+ years it's noticeably worse than it used to be. Not much you can do but roll with it, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to call it out every once in a while when I feel like it.Stop suggesting Brian Kelly, please. This is the only time I will say it nicely.I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, he would switch to USC possibly right before Bama plays them to start 2016, which would be glorious to see. On the other hand, he'd be reconstructing a new Death Star that would be operational almost immediatebly and permanently orbiting ND.Wouldn't be the first celebrated program savior to do so. Snyder took his first "retirement" after two failed seasons when the going got tough, 4 and 5 wins respectively.Just saying there are parallels.It's been a crazy year. Now go back a week and a half and look at all the hurricane madness.

Ah well, I'm just going to sit here, grab a glass of wine, and wait to find out that we actually beat Clemson. Any minute now... :p

Now throw all the injury garbage for a pantload of teams on top of that. Fuck everything.

The theme of 2015 is simply "who the fuck is going to get out alive?"Guam isn't a state?! OH MY GOD!To be fair to you, nobody expected him to bail in the middle of the season.Okay that was gold. 

Should have said Ceres.We're going to have like 20 articles posted saying Coach O isn't a candidate.Pat Haden is a muppet.If the Vols beat them post-Spurrier, it's basically post-mortem, right?God, you say?

*Hmm.*Read half the shit I say (actually it's not recommended)...I understand. :pI...can't necessarily agree with this. USC is now just fine in the talent department, basically matching up with ND. Plus, some of the top talent ND has right now is leaving after this season, which is why BK emphasized the "this is the year" message. The question is more how many stay for their last year who have a year left but a high draft stock (Fuller, Jaylon, etc), and if they can prevent injuries next year, too.Easy. Utah doesn't remotely compare to TCU when it comes to recruiting grounds as well as program support, no disrespect to them. Simply put, TCU provides more reasons to stay when another program comes calling than Utah does. In addition, TCU has more room to match whatever anyone else would throw at their coach as far as salaries are concerned.
USC is USC

SCar is South CarolinaThis is the answer. Football-wise alone, South Carolina just plays second fiddle to Southern Cal.It's amazing to see someone actually come to this realization "in the wild". Also, you should probably hide now.Just stating a fact.I agree he's interesting that way, as that is the way I've always seen him. What I meant is that when you say he's not witty around here (or at least saying anything remotely similar to that), which he really wasn't, you tend to get a LOT of backlash.Wait...really?lolI wouldn't necessarily say that they're more open. It entirely depends on the quarterback, to be honest. Some QBs run limited sets to keep them in their comfort zones, especially if younger or newer to the system. Some QBs are given carte blache after they have proven themselves, so the playbook opens up. I'd say there are plenty of NFL systems that are run the same way.

As far as the triple option, the reason you don't see it is how dangerous/risky the play can be, both from a physical standpoint, i.e. a RB getting blindsided by an NFL-caliber LB when taking a pitch, and from the point of potentially losing the ball due to fumbles due to bad timing on a pitch. It's just too risky. Every so often you may see it run as a trick (I vaguely remember seeing it like once in the last 5 years), but it's just not worth it with all the other options you have, both passing and running the ball behind an NFL quality OL and with the RBs/WRs they have.Well at least it wasn't False information.

*I'll just see myself out.*&gt;500%

Whoa there.&gt; "le omg I'M ANGRY BLAH BLAH BLAH"

You're missing at least one "SEC".Pelini and Bert on the same staff would be....a sight to see.&gt;but isn't his personality compared to a cactus?

No, he's literally a cactus.Well at least they're letting him do a proper mic drop.Okay that would be amazing.Giving it a year both allows you to set things up and do it right as well as doing it "on the day" as an anniversary of sorts. That's the way I'd do it. If you try to rush it, I feel like it wouldn't be the greatest ceremony, etc.No. More like instant illegal play.Vacated wins are bullshit.Because everyone loves him, so saying anything negative about bolting in the middle of the year isn't allowed. We also don't know everything yet.This is True. However when it comes to conversation around this subreddit, he can literally do no wrong in the eyes of the masses. That's part of the reason why you see nobody questioning the move, because if you do you're automatically cast out.That's a perfect way to sum up how I feel about him, for some reason.Woo big win over Navy has ND back to 13!Three shutouts. They deserve one week.Basically a UCLA lock at this point.ONE week only!lol Game Thread.SETIf this year's record is any indication, that's a terrible bet.

*runs*Vegas doesn't know shit about the run ....of the mouth....game.100.0And awaaaay we gooooIIRC a similar situation was said to exist at LSU during the offseason, but it's not the kind of debt one might think of like personal debt. Not sure, though.McCord, look at that ball fly!Still hungry, eh?

*BREAKING: Urban Meyer to retire from Ohio State effective immediately*Wait, did he just say Spurrier's legacy will be SCar's "Sandstorm enthusiasm"?He said he's not retiring?

**Spurrier to USC confirmed.**I can't wait to fucking leave this hellhole and I'll be happy as fuck that day.To be fair, nobody will openly say that, to avoid burning any bridges."Our team wasn't as good as I thought we were going to be."

:|lol["I'll have something to do every day."](http://d3f5994kvuwcz1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/spurrierball.jpg)0-6 UCF can't catch a break."Let's get moving.." aka "I have a tee time, you fuckers."Wait, do you mean this in a good or bad way?What's the general feel on Tanner, good or bad?I mean, half of the subreddit are acting like Spurrier is dead, so it fits. :p"Lay it on the line"

Oh shit...We Are Marshall confirmed.Don't watch the chatroom.

edit: you fuckersYou mean Spurrier leaving or something else besides that?

edit: i keep forgetting asking for clarification isn't allowedLou's a great coach, one of the best, but he was at the end of his career when he went down to SCar. He also doesn't always bring in the greatest character players.USC and ND hired guys with roots in their school. I'd be careful.Well, I was judging that by the fact that my question got multiple downvotes without an answer just for wondering what you were specifically talking about. Yay /r/CFB.It would be silly for Dantonio to leave for SCar. It's a lateral if not somewhat downward move, program-wise. MSU isn't just good at football now, they also have a great Basketball program as well. The entire athletics "complex" of the school is doing quite well. The same cannot be said for South Carolina.Just saying consolidating everything in a sticky that happened yesterday might be a good idea, given the magnitude of all those events.I'm waiting for Haden to get so bad that it turns into Mchigan/Brandon 2.0 and I start feeling bad for USC.Don't lie.Not right away, but some people would eventually come around and they'd at least avoid having to tell you to stfu about how great you are. :pI would support this move, if it works.The most practical is that he'll probably become an analyst of sorts on ESPN or whatever. Doesn't even have to make regular appearances, just during the season once a month/week or something.Yeah, that was another logistical part of it. Stuff like this, if you want to do it RIGHT, takes time. I've been part of setting up such events before, and when it's rushed, it feels that way when it happens and it's kinda shitty. When it's planned, things run mostly smoothly and all goes well, nobody is panicking, etc. It then becomes an overall enjoyment for everyone to take part in, which should be the goal.He definitely at least needs to do a show with Feherty some time soon.Well what the hell, now I remember vaguely this happening...Well, maximum hilarity for USC would be stealing either Mora or BK.

Maximum hilarity for SCar would be stealing Richt and then going on to beat UGA for like 10 years in a row, or stealing Dabo and doing the same to Clemson.I meant more "by comparison to MSU", not in the sense that "SCar has bad athletics". They're definitely improving. As of right now, for SCar BB, I just remember Devan Downey off the top of my head. Had a couple great games but I can't remember who they were against now.All this before they lose to Northwestern this week, IU as well. :p

&gt; go winless for the rest of the season.

&gt;with a perfect record.

uhhhHe then changed it to lossless, and now finally undefeated. :p[...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l8HHPrQuj08/UFHoFiGMxWI/AAAAAAAAC4U/CZP4l20VFx0/s1600/john-lackey.gif)The team just isn't that good.I'd say there's at least enough of them that believe this kind of stuff to fill the Shoe.I think the Fighting Hawks logo could be the start of a really slick design if it were sharpened up, and would look pretty good on a helmet.

I like the name North Stars for some reason, but picking an actual physical mascot you can have seems like a better idea.Hey, I said the same about Alabama, not intending to offend. I'm still not sold on their ability to get through without at least one more loss. I saw 9-3 coming into this year, in part not because of anything specifically bad they've done, but mainly because some other opponents may be better, namely LSU and perhaps playing @A&amp;M this weekend becomes a tough game. Then again, I was riding the Arky wagon for a short while after the way they finished the year. Loss of a RB really hurt them, IMO, though.Hell yeah, nice tie in there. Angles and whatnot can always be tweaked on those points to sharpen the look of it.God dammit.Chop block is when a man is blocking low while another goes high. Cut block is where you just basically go for a block at the legs, like when RBs block a blitzing defender out of the backfield.

And I think it was far enough away from the actual ball that there was no reason to dive at his legs, especially from the side/behind like that.Looks like clipping, almost, really.You can't chop block anyone. Period.Something tells me he knows.I keep telling everyone Notre Dame is the greatest football team in the country, Michigan State second, Tennessee third. They should believe me because there's no way I'm biased.-_-"Just accept my 'FIRED' invite on Outlook."Bill SpurierWhere In The World Is Sark In San Diego?\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afDoes "Everyone vs ND" count?[Serious] So, do players get paid for their picture being put on the front?It's been an hour.OSU, ND, and MSU were all in the top 5 just a little while back. That was nice, wasn't it? :(Welp, I guess Al Golden is about to be fired today. Who's next?Well, the Notre Dame Victory March. Rocky Top would be second.ND beating USC while those teams fall could be huge to jump back into the top 10.Sounds a little like ND's Clemson performance, 4 though. 2 were definitely forced by Clemson, though.

They just absolutely shut down the ND offense early on, too.Not going to lie, I do enjoy this one very much.*They're coming. They're going to try to take what's mine...*You realize Holtz and May aren't doing Final anymore, right?I'm hanging on to the dream that Jaylon Smith decides to stay for his final year.McTrojans

Damien McMama (likes Big Macs)http://i.imgur.com/NQHKSVE.gifIf so, my Master Plan worked far better than I could have dreamed.Alabama could beat the Patriots.I could see Joe Schmidt, ND's current MLB, becoming a long-tenure head coach somewhere.It's good to hear that he got great recognition and that there's solid support behind him. Hopefully for them, USC doesn't fuck up this relationship like they did Coach O, interim or not.

I'm honestly getting the feeling this USC team is going to come out really ready to play on Saturday.Depends on where that staff is by then.Martinez and Ragland are both MLB/ILB, typically, IIRC, Schobert is your lone OLB. I get that Schobert has had a good year, IIRC, but leaving Jaylon Smith off in favor of him is borderline criminal.


This is of course just my opinion and 2 cents.You spelled NCAA14 wrong.I FOUND HIM!How dare you.I don't like this game.It was definitely a shitty move.Yeah I wasn't trying to take away from him, but it may have come off that way. In Jaylon's case, there's a whole lot of "running away from him" going on right now with the teams we play, too.UGA fans  (and others) took exception yesterday to me saying it wasn't a "destination job" quite like these were. An Auburn fan told me to "take off [my] Notre Dame goggles".

LSU also needs to be on there, IMO, but I can see either side of the argument there, I guess.No, that was the year. Alternates locations each year, so it'd have to have been 2003 if it was the game prior in ND Stadium.

edit: actually, hold on, that may not have been the year, now that I think of it...
