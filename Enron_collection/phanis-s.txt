 Michelle, Do you have any more information on these trades?  (such as trade date, beginning and ending dates)  Thanks. 
 Diane, Below is a list of gas trades that were originally between Columbia Energy Services and ENA, which Settlements is trying to reconcile.  CES says they are not their trades, and they do not appear to be part of the trades that were assigned from CES to New Power.  Can you give me anymore information on them?  Thanks.
