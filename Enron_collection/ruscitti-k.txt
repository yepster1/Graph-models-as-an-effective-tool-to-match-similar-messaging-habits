 I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you can do it all. Of course, after you assemble the chair.  What was Lowery doing in San Antonio??  KR 
 Thanks for the gift certificate. You shouldn't have done that.  I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow for 5 days.  I'll talk to you when I get back.  Kevin 
 Let's shoot for 6:30am on Friday.  I should be able to meet for about 15 minutes.  Let me know if this works for you.  Kevin 
 Sounds great.  Let me know what your schedule is like.  Kevin 
 Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants.  Thanks for your help.  Kevin  My email at home is kruscitti@aol.com (I think). 
 Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his phone number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 18049 Torrence Ave Lansing, IL  60438  Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was referred by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from Bill.  He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of cut, clarity, color, and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and describe them over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to be very competitive.  Let me know how it goes.  Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 Thanks.  Is there something I could do to facilitate the process.  KR 
 Any word.  I've been waiting for a while on this issue.  Kevin 
 Thanks for the update.  Let me know when everything is a go. 
 You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so poorly.  I often look back with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, not to mention his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be compared to x-Philly and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or not Ivan will elect to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.  On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May. It's a fixer-upper. All our weekends are spent working on it.  I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going in your world.  Tell Rina and the kids we said hi.  Kevin 
 Sell 'em all.  There's no turnaround in sight.  What's going on??  KR 
 I forgot, we have a new telephone # (713) 880-4157.  I'll pick you up on Thursday and I'll take Friday off.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Thank you.  Kevin 
 I have no additional info.  I was waiting to hear back from you.  I'll give them a call.  Kevin 
 Unfortunately there're not.  I already checked. 
 Thanks 
 Everything is correct except from my location - 3234B. Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 I'll be in town all weekend.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Anything in particular you want to do in the Lone Star State.  KR 
 F.P.,  Do you have your schedule yet?  Let me know as soon as you can.  I need to schedule a trip with work and I'll schedule it around your visit.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Still waiting to hear back about your possible visit.  Any word?  Kevin 
 Thought you might find this interesting!!  http://www.fortune.com/   XXOOXXOO,  Kevin 
 Did you pull the trigger? 
 Debra,  Could you call me when we're set to trade w/ Cinnabar?  Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.  Kevin x3-6320 
 T.J.  Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just like Rena, huh?  As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller does though. Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.  Kevin 
 We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the delayed response, I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make it out.  I'll check into some things to do.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 We should be in town that week.  I'll make sure we save the date.  Kevin 
 Kelly,  I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 firms and he didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything changes, let me know. It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the Astros are in town that weekend. I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear everything's going well.  I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore me as usual.  Talk to you soon.  KR  P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some serious work.  Hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it. 
 Chump,  Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you. Between work, the wedding, and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been pretty stressed. As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down considerably.  We're only going to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that includes you of course, Moller, Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her though, she's the only one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room.  I feel kinda bad about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like dealing with Kim.  She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.  We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a catered dinner for about 45 folks. It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.  Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched you'll be a lot closer.  You could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we should have it in decent shape. We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs a lot of work.  We'll be busy for the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.  Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back.  Take care and tell Marie we said hi.  Kevin 
 We'd love to go to the opener.  Let's talk Monday.  I don't know if I'll be able to get downstairs by 11:00am, so let's work something out.  Kevin

 Congrats Murli,  Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job at Enron. I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the Communications group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would be better at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 (W) and we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate brokers to refer you to.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 713-853-6320 (W) 713-830-0671 (H) 
 Dave,  It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you enjoyed dinner.  Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I have a quick question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if Mar is currently higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what happens if you withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How is this accounted for?  I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.  Kevin 
 I hope that didn't surprise you.  You notice that our avg GMATs are stronger than Harvards. 
 Congratulations!!  I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, huh? Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why didn't get back to you.  I'll try you today.  Kevin  P.S.  Great Name 
 You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite some time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?  KR 
 Leroy,  Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually am just catching up with my emails now - Friday at 5pm.  I'm interested in talking to you about the lunch discussion.  Kevin 3-6320 
 Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys. I hope it comes across OK.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin   - DCP00617.BMP 
 Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is working for Johnson Controls. It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for about 5 months.  I love my new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and Michigan.  Things have been incredibly busy.  The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress.  How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears games?  The Scarlet Knights have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.  Let's talk soon.  Kevin 
 Chris,  Please take a look at the attached language and forward it to Stacey for her comments.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 Anne Marie,  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 11th. Keep me in mind for next time though.  Kevin 
 Murli,  Great to hear from you.  I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll enjoy you're experience at Enron.  Good luck during your final semester.  Kevin 
 That is if you ever get you LLC set up.  Look forward to trading with you in 2001.  KR 
 Joke, huh? 
 Davis,  Let me know if this helps.  kevin 
 If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well. Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying to do.  Kevin x3-6320 
 I received the email.  Thanks,  kevin 
 Dude,  What's your work #.  I need to give you a call.  Kevin 
 David,  I have attached a listing of all my Bid Week transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Kevin Ruscitti (713) 853-6320 
 T.J.,  I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it. How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA?  Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 You too.  Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi.  Kevin 
 Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend. The only problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.  KR 
 The 12th isn't good for me b/c we're moving.   Any other weekend should be OK though.  Kevin 
 Didn't you say mapquest said it takes around 6 hrs to get to Houston from Corpus Dickhead? 
 Thanks,  Let me know if you're looking to sell some more, because I could do better than my EOL bid in this case.  Kevin 
 I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you can do it all. Of course, after you assemble the chair.  What was Lowery doing in San Antonio??  KR

 We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.  Let me know what you want to do.  KR 
 You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some good red meat.  KR 
 Stamos,  Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.  In terms of your email reply, you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable of solving the problem.   KR 
 Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single one.  I heard there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to you much since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.  KR 
 Stamos,  I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash. The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning. I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.  Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye. Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state?? If you own any CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply. Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse. If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.   Kevin 
 That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope Lowery has held off on buying his house.  Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.  KR 
 Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game. Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps, this won't happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with a grain of salt.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 BL,  Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer. What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid.  Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll be in Dallas?  Let me know.  KR
