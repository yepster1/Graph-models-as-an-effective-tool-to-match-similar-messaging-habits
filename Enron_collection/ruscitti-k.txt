 I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you can do it all. Of course, after you assemble the chair.  What was Lowery doing in San Antonio??  KR 
 Thanks for the gift certificate. You shouldn't have done that.  I'm heading to San Francisco tomorrow for 5 days.  I'll talk to you when I get back.  Kevin 
 Let's shoot for 6:30am on Friday.  I should be able to meet for about 15 minutes.  Let me know if this works for you.  Kevin 
 Sounds great.  Let me know what your schedule is like.  Kevin 
 Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants.  Thanks for your help.  Kevin  My email at home is kruscitti@aol.com (I think). 
 Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his phone number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 18049 Torrence Ave Lansing, IL  60438  Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was referred by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from Bill.  He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of cut, clarity, color, and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and describe them over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to be very competitive.  Let me know how it goes.  Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 Thanks.  Is there something I could do to facilitate the process.  KR 
 Any word.  I've been waiting for a while on this issue.  Kevin 
 Thanks for the update.  Let me know when everything is a go. 
 You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so poorly.  I often look back with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, not to mention his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be compared to x-Philly and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or not Ivan will elect to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.  On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May. It's a fixer-upper. All our weekends are spent working on it.  I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going in your world.  Tell Rina and the kids we said hi.  Kevin 
 Sell 'em all.  There's no turnaround in sight.  What's going on??  KR 
 I forgot, we have a new telephone # (713) 880-4157.  I'll pick you up on Thursday and I'll take Friday off.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Thank you.  Kevin 
 I have no additional info.  I was waiting to hear back from you.  I'll give them a call.  Kevin 
 Unfortunately there're not.  I already checked. 
 Thanks 
 Everything is correct except from my location - 3234B. Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kevin 
 I'll be in town all weekend.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Anything in particular you want to do in the Lone Star State.  KR 
 F.P.,  Do you have your schedule yet?  Let me know as soon as you can.  I need to schedule a trip with work and I'll schedule it around your visit.  Looking forward to seeing you.  KR 
 Still waiting to hear back about your possible visit.  Any word?  Kevin

 Did you pull the trigger? 
 Debra,  Could you call me when we're set to trade w/ Cinnabar?  Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.  Kevin x3-6320 
 T.J.  Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just like Rena, huh?  As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller does though. Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.  Kevin 
 We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the delayed response, I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make it out.  I'll check into some things to do.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 We should be in town that week.  I'll make sure we save the date.  Kevin 
 Kelly,  I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 firms and he didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything changes, let me know. It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the Astros are in town that weekend. I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear everything's going well.  I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore me as usual.  Talk to you soon.  KR  P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some serious work.  Hopefully it'll be habitable by the time you see it. 
 Chump,  Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you. Between work, the wedding, and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been pretty stressed. As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down considerably.  We're only going to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that includes you of course, Moller, Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her though, she's the only one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room.  I feel kinda bad about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like dealing with Kim.  She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.  We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a catered dinner for about 45 folks. It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.  Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched you'll be a lot closer.  You could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we should have it in decent shape. We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs a lot of work.  We'll be busy for the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.  Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back.  Take care and tell Marie we said hi.  Kevin 
 We'd love to go to the opener.  Let's talk Monday.  I don't know if I'll be able to get downstairs by 11:00am, so let's work something out.  Kevin

Is this the Communications group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would be better at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.

 Dave,  It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you enjoyed dinner.  Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I have a quick question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if Mar is currently higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what happens if you withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How is this accounted for?  I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.  Kevin 
 I hope that didn't surprise you.  You notice that our avg GMATs are stronger than Harvards. 
 Congratulations!!  I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, huh? Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why didn't get back to you.  I'll try you today.  Kevin  P.S.  Great Name 
 You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite some time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?  KR 
 Leroy,  Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually am just catching up with my emails now - Friday at 5pm.  I'm interested in talking to you about the lunch discussion.  Kevin 3-6320 
 Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys. I hope it comes across OK.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin   - DCP00617.BMP 
 Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is working for Johnson Controls. It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for about 5 months.  I love my new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and Michigan.  Things have been incredibly busy.  The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress.  How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears games?  The Scarlet Knights have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.  Let's talk soon.  Kevin

 You too.  Make sure you tell Paul I said Hi.  Kevin 
 Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend. The only problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.  KR 
 The 12th isn't good for me b/c we're moving.   Any other weekend should be OK though.  Kevin

 We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.  Let me know what you want to do.  KR 
 You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some good red meat.  KR 
 Stamos,  Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.  In terms of your email reply, you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable of solving the problem.   KR 
 Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single one.  I heard there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to you much since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.  KR 
 Stamos,  I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash. The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning. I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.  Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye. Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state?? If you own any CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply. Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse. If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.   Kevin 
 That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope Lowery has held off on buying his house.  Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.  KR 
 Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game. Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps, this won't happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with a grain of salt.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 BL,  Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer. What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid.  Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll be in Dallas?  Let me know.  KR

I got married in September down the Jersey shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It needs an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.  How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he doing?  When is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but only for a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of Christmas.

 The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.    Jan. 25, 2001, 10:59PM  Enron rating setup irks many workers By L.M. SIXEL  TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month.  Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other.  Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" or "issues."  An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone."  The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up with, are not based just on performance.  Instead, they compare employee against employee.  "It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month.  While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also expected to be team players, according to the memo.   `Horse-trading' of rank denied The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up.  Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another employee.  An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the manager he is working for, the insider said.  Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said.  But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect of bargaining.  She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way.  Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well.  It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous.   Some may not fit in Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in that environment.  After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't do well in an entrepreneurial environment.  Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation.  Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3."  Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said.  But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings.  And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent your job, add new business lines or create something totally new.  "Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- To voice comments, telephone 713-220-2000 and dial in code 1002.

 Julie,  Glad to hear some positive news.  Hope you are doing quite well.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things could blow up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I think a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be interesting to see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if California gets the kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.  KR 
 The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any hurry to buy, the summer should give you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that the problem will come and go for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the situation.  I have no idea what they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.  What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the market -  who would've thought San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are also a lot of intangibles associated with home ownership as your aware of.  I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast of it.  Also, you could call me if you have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim and Kendall I said hi.  Kevin 
 Brett,  I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.  As a result, I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.  By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.  Kevin 
 Mr. B. Lowery,  First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even see Kendall. I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try to send it again if you can.  In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed - big time. I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you said, noone really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It has the potential to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing out the utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will likely prevent many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would want to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power interruptions while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only way California will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeable future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the next couple years. But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.  When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up. I'll talk to you soon.  Kevin

 Bri,  What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him? He's pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering how the citizens of California viewed him.  Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you soon. Send an updated picture if you have one.  Kevin 
 Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  The only problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.  KR 
 You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some good red meat.  KR 
 I did get your email and my work number is 713-853-6320.  My home # is 713-880-4157.  I'll give you a call this weekend.  It's incredibly difficult for me to talk at work so I'll give you a shout at home.   Talk to you soon.  KR 
 Bri,  What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?  He's pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering how the citizens of California viewed him.  Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you soon. Send an updated picture if you have one.  Kevin 
 I've emailed you after both of your messages.  Did you fail to get them.  Let me know.  Kevin 
 What planet did Gray Davis come from??  What's the perception of this guy in California??  Hope all is well.  KR 
 Julie,  If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.  I do have $5.11 in the system but I could have easily made a mistake.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Kevin  P.S.  Sorry it took me so long to reply. 
 I hope you picked up some EOG on Friday or today.  KR 
 Stamas,  If you could only own one stock what would it be?  For me it would be EOG Resources - don't ignore this one.  KR 
 Stamos,  Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.  In terms of your email reply, you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable of solving the problem.   KR 
 Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single one.  I heard there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to you much since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.  KR 
 Stamos,  I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash. The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning. I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.  Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye. Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply. Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse. If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.   Kevin 
 That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope Lowery has held off on buying his house.  Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.  KR 
 Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game. Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won't happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with a grain of salt.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 BL,  Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer. What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid.  Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll be in Dallas?  Let me know.  KR 
 Easter was great, how 'bout yours.  It was just me, Lisa and a friend of mine. How's everything been with you?  How are the wedding plans coming?  Have you seen Bruce lately?  How 'bout my brother?  Kevin

 Counnnnnnnnn,  What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm going to meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just booked my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could make it down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military discount - one of the perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just decided to do it a few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll have to get together when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is going great for the both of you.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 I'm goin' to have to bag on the game.  My return flight is at noon on Sunday. I get in at 4:45pm on Friday.  What time will you be in?  Do you want me to check on a place to eat Friday or Saturday?  Let me know.  KR

 Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were out of town the last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.   I think it healthy to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better understanding, I find, typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more happiness in life. However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We all have regrets, but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run.  I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might imagine, I got a kick out of that.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 Hope all is well.  I haven't forgot abt the Hawaiin Electric position.  I'll try to get in touch with my friend today.  I've been out of town for the last few days.  Kevin 
 TJ,  Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us feel great. We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year. We've just been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small bungalow in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell everyone we said hi.  Thanks again,  Kevin 
 The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat troublesome to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it as your primary car.  Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends I've had in ages.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin 
 I'm glad you had a great time.  It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were able to spend the entire weekend with us.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had so much fun.  I hope you felt the same way.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin

 Alberto,  You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a new fundamental analysis group.  I know he is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're interested in trading, it's probably the best way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a long term interest in trading or if you're just looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide you with some insight into the area.  Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to me first if you'd like.  Kevin

 Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is getting near and the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the plans at this point are minimum.  How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an event.  The party included - get this crew - Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things never change.  Talk to you soon.  Kevin
