 All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.  Good Luck and stay in touch. 
 Thursday would be great. 
 Actually I don't have your number. 
 What are the cost per trade? 
 Haven't heard form you in awhile.  Thought you might find this funny. 
 This is still rough, but it is a little better. 
 Don't tell her I sent you this. 
 You scare me! 
 Get to work on thursday. 
 I bought in today I think that we are very near the bottom.  Mid-teens has to be a good buy.  Famous last words! 
 I won't be available from2:00 to 2:45 mountain time 
  Worsley, you might even be able to find a woman with this kind of service.  Or if you prefer I hear they have some cute goats. 
 Reminds of the old TLC days. 
  May have to reschedule until the end of next week to bring Bruce to Houston.  What does Thurs/Friday of next week look like. 
 We are reviewing the security tapes today.  The tape doesn't lie!  303-575-6473 
 Could you check this out?  It should be on my Mastercard 
 Can we meet next Tuesday on October 30th?  Afternoon is prefferable. 
 I will start to get you some good ones. 
 If you have  a minute, give us an update.  We just want to protect our customers ASAP if we can.  We would like to set up alternative purchasers for our producers. 
 I told Alicia that she and the kids are eating way too much!  She told me that her Oils business is really taking off!  I think she may need to start turning tricks! 
 No I am delerious because I am too poor to eat.  It should be Lost Creek. 
 I would like to see you get on the Denver 1/2 day schedule.  Any 12 hours you choose from 6:00 A. M. to 8:00 P.M. 
  Sue, Just wanted to let you know that we filed comments in support of Xcel's ability to manage price risk and be incentivized to do so.  If you have questions about our comments, give me a call.  303-575-6473  Thanks, Mark 
  These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.  Thanks,  Mark 
  Brian,  I propose that we use the attached contracts for the bridge between our two term deals.  Mark 
 It works for me.  Steve, would that be possible for you? 
 What is your fax number?  I will send you the project summary. 
 I have to go to the management meeting in San Antonio on the afternoon of the 14th.  Would it be possible to meet in Denver on the morning of the 14th? 
 Would Nov. 1 or 2 work for either of you?  Email me your fax number and I will fax you a copy of what the developers have given me.  Thanks 
 We wre downgraded today and will probably go bankrupt in the next two days.  You should probably not come in tomorrow.  You can if you want but you may not get paid.  Call me. 303-575-6473. 
 Plain vanilla intervention is fine. 
 We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl  Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin? 
 What time are you meeting today?  Do you want me to participate? 
 No changes to mine. 
 ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.  There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.  These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:  1.  Power Marketing and Project development 2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise  Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.  Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.  Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!  Thanks a lot.  303-575-6473 
 Let's set something up for monday 
   I only added one line, otherwise it looks good. 
 I wish I was that smart! 
 I can show you what th
