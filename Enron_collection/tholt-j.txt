 CHANGED PRICE ON 3/8 TO 16.00 
 Guess I won't be getting any more roses from you since California is closing all of its greenhouses. 
 Jan- Sutherland 53453 
 you need to talk to someone in scheduling because I do not path gas. 
 Joe just told me the other day that he got the check.    I never saw it.  It came when I was out of town.  Tel your Mom -thank you.  Thanks for getting me the address.  I hope you have a great Christmas vacation. 
 it is 2.79 
 I show the fixed price of $4.78.Switched to GDA on the 10th. 
 Whoever wrote this did an excellent job 
 i HEA RYOU LOUD AND CLEAR. 
 PNM is incorrect.  The price is 4.86.  Tell them that the location of the gas is west texas pool and that we NEVER sell gas in the west texas pool based on a san juan gas daily price.  Once you tell them that they will realize that they are wrong. 
 PNM is incorrect.  The price is $4.86.  Tell them that this deal is for west texas pool gas and that we never sell west texas pool gas based on a san juan gas daily. 
 Friday was so perfect.  It snowed huge snow flakes.  Accumulation was just about 1/4 inch. The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people. You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.  I would go back agai n if the right opportunity came up. 
 I only buy  pool gas-Can you make it available at the appropriate pool. 
 Just a little heads up. It is going to be so cold in Omaha next week.  Will probably hit around Tuesday.  Expect highs below zero.for about a week.. Better get your chores done this week because you are not going to want to go outside next week..  Haven't seen it this cold since 1983.. Will encompass the entire country.  Gas prices going through the roof. 
 I received the gift yesterday.  It will look lovely with my leather coat at the theater-thanks 
 So you bought me a new winter coat for New York-Thanks-I ned it.  The card is adorable-how did you do it.  I love it. 
 Lucky you.  I think you should convince her that her house is too small for her and the kids. 
 TOO COOL 
 Just talk to   Mike on figures-why do you need them 
 NICE 
 no-they did not and Tori will be on vaction next Friday and Monday-would like it done by Wed.-Nov 29-Thanks 
 what type of flexiblity would we hav on teh Terrell plant gas?  Can we switch it daily or do we have to committ to either El Paso or  PGE at the start of the month? 
 Looking forward to meeting you in a couple of weeks. 
 Frank-we need to know if you have made any  arrangements for Mom Tholt's funeral.  Barb, Mike and Bob are flying nto Washington DC Dulles on Tuesday to tour the city.  Joe and I are flying in on Thursday at noon.  Everyone is leaving on Sunday. Bob and Us are leaving early Sunday morning.  So we will be driving back on Saturday night.  We are planning to stay together and rent cars together. Aunt Mary Agnes has offered to make hotel reservations for those days people who will be staying in DC.  Either Barb or Mike will make reservations for Pennsylvania.  We need to know if you would like us to include you in our reservations or if you plan on just meeting us there. There is only going to be  Mass on Saturday for Mom Tholt at 11:30 followed by lunch at Aunt Jean's.  Aunt Mary Agnes is suppose to be sending us money in the mail for plane reservations.  Please let us know as soon as possible, 
 Congratulations, I can tell you are very excited about this.  Speaking of digging, on Thursday, they had a crew in our neighborhood digging to lay fiber-optic cable,  they hit a sewer line and then the gas line and blew up 2 houses.  I walked over there yesterday,  one house is completely gone, the house next door is only half there and the houses across the street are all boarded up because they blew the windows out of it.  Such excitement.  Thank God no one was killed. 
 Per our phone converstion,  during the last couple of days I have been floating the US Gas West products and sorting by deal type.  However, I am getting products that are not west products .  For example, under "deal type-west basis", the following non-west products are appearing:  GD/D TrLA-Hub (nov 8-30); GD/D NGPL-Hu for No 8-30; and GD/D ANRLA-HUB (Nov 8-30), I 
 Did you get your house plans approved? 
 Do you know when you are flying into Pennsylvania.  It sounds like Barb, Cindy and Mike, might be going in on Monday or Tuesday to tour Washington DC.  Are you going to stay with relatives in PA or in a hotel. 
 no problem 
 we did not get it. Send it to the new email  jtholt @houston.rr.com 
 Thanks for the info-I will send him a card. 
 Thanks for the info on Lloyd's wife-I'll be sure to send him a card.  I'll see what's going on over Christmas-maybe Saturday we can have lunch.  Do you think Nebraska is going to be up for this week's game.  I bet it killed you not to be able to watch the game last week. 
 An analyst rate QWEST a buy today on CNN.   WHOOOPIE.  Hey -I'm coming to town for my grade school reunion  on Nov 17.  Leaving Sunday at 6:00 p.m. 
 I talked to your assistant and gave her my itinerary-but I don't know if she got your ticket.  I have a flight that leaves around 5:30 p.m. on Monday. We are staying at the Biltmore.  There attire is business casual.  I am wearing nice slacks and a sweater.  I told Ed we would meet him about 8:00 before the 8:30 meeting to make sure everything is working properly.  He is supplying the computer.  I was told that he only needed a high speed internet connection.  I also faxed him the info that is on Enron Online concerning what is needed regarding computer equipment.    I will give you more details on Monday regarding my flight and the address of the hotel.  Your assistent is out today so I don't know if she booked you on my flight or not.  I went through Travel Agency and  had them hold a reservation but not to ticket you..  Your secretary told me you do not like to use them so I left it in her hands. 
 Looked on Continental for prices on our flights.  Continental direct flight to Paris in April is about $880.  Same flight in March is $550.00 
 Thanks for the information.  Joe got a chuckle  last night when I told him that you tried his ketchup trick. 
 What do you think about this strategy?  Maybe we should have Deb call Marion and review the list of hotels where Enron has a corporate rate and ask her opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.  Maybe -at that point she would volunteer her flat? 
 RE: New York City Looks like we leave Houston at 1:15 and get to New York at 5:52. We leave New York at 3:00 and arrive Houston at 5:49.  The phone number at the Barbizon Hotel is 212-838-5700.  Enron has a corporate rate there.  Suppose to be $222.00 Deb- if you want to try to get your own room-be sure to ask for the Enron Corp rate.  RE:  Europe.  There are several hotels in London which are listed as giving Enron corporate rates -prices range from $69 to 215.  The Ritz is $180.  I show no discounts for hotels in Paris. 
 They tell me that having a high speed internet connection is essential for enron online (SDN-T).  That's the only latest info I have. 
 Can you tell me how Mom Tholt is doing?  Is she out of the hospital?  Is she going to Montana to stay with Mike and Judy? 
 we just got the animated cards-is that what you mean? 
 I received your memo-sounds like all we need is a high speed internet connection and that is it. 
 Ed  called me on the equipment.  I asked him if he could provide the computer.  I downloaded some inofrmation on EOL regarding technical questions which provides some of the requirements for EOL and sent them to him. Let me know if there is anything else he needs to provide.  I have talked to Julia's secretary and plane and hotel reservations have been reserved for Julie. 
 resent the fax-let me know if you get all the pages 
 I am coming in on a United Flight 7954 that leaves LA at 3:15 and arrives San Diego at 4:04.  Staying at theHyatt Islandia in Mission Bay.  Look forward to seeing you even if it is for a short time.  I'm leaving for Vail tomorrow afternoon-so if you have any questions I'll get back to you on Monday. 
 Just sent you some info over the fax-I willlet you know if we need anything else. 
 I think that Dave may have is facts wrong.  Joe talked to GRADY  yesterday and they have sold their house in Conroe and are buying a brand new one on Lake Conroe.  Some new Dream House.  Glad you are going to Vail- I'm on the flight that leaves at 11.45 on Wednesay. 
 This works-I will work on getting our equipment needs for you. 
 This date works for me so I will assume that Julie will be going.  I will work on flight  arrangements for Julie and I unless you think you might be going.  I need your help in determing what equipment needs we need.  Call me at 35539 or respond to this memo. 
 I f we get out of here early, I may run to Foley's.  I will leave you a voice mail or an e-mail to let you know.So be sure to check.  I was just messing withyou on the Evita.  I am going out to lunch with a customer today so I'm not going to be extremely hungery.  Maybe we just go to PF Chang's and I can have a lettuce wrap. 
 My broker called me this morning and asked me how I was doing and I told him again that I was coming to New York and he said no problem with getting tickets to Avita and the Lion King.  Easter next year is Sunday April 15. 
 Come by anytime after 10:00 on any day..  I will be on vacation on Thurs and Friday though. 
 let me know if I can do anything to help 
 Nat gas is at a discount with Enron stock at 83 and what's your stock price. Did I tell you the company is going to give us more stock options at the start of the year.  Oh-and we get free bus passes.  So not only do they provide me with free lunch every day-oh-did I  forget to mention that too.-but they pay for my transportation to work. 
 It works.  Frank told me that you were trying to get in touch with me .  I tried to send you something but it didn't work.  Did you meet your Uncle Joe last night .  He'll talk your ear off so watch out.  Let me know what's happening out there. 
 Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was in Houston a couple of weeks ago .  It was pretty good.  Too bad you'll never see him in Omaha.  Guess what else?  We got a memo today that Enron is giving all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet connection.  Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.  Does your company do this with your telephones? 
 Enron North America is interested in purchasing 30000 mmbtu/day of WFS Milagro Plant Gas-Agreement to Agreement Transfer for the period November 1,2000-March 31,2001 at Inside FERC Blanco plus $.01.  Both parties must flow 100% of gas. 
 Are you going to Las Vegas today to see you mom or are you waiting to see if she gets better?  Can't get a hold of Barb on the cell phone. 
 Art Festival is week-end of Oct 14 and 15.  We're in. 
 I don't do tagg but I'll give to the appropriate person 
 can you do this-I don't how 
 My broker called and we are definitely in for Tina Turner.  He is waiting unitl the last week to give me the tickets so we get premo seats.  Have fun this week-end. 
 I switched deal number 341242 to a sale and deal number 341270 as a buy 
 I had a thought.  I wonder how far away Nancy Gardiner is from Vail because maybe we could go se her on Saturday or maybe we just want to take it easy in Vai and just relax.  Any thoughts. 
 Do not want to go to Vegas-been there too much already this year.  I am going to have a message in Co.  Good job on the fare-that's cheaper than mine.  If you want to stay at the RIOin Las Vegas-Southwest Gas has a cheap corporate rate that you can get-it's off the strip but it's nice. Every room is a sweat.  Just call and ask for it. 
 Sounds like a fun week-end.Hotel is  Vail Marriott Mountain Resort and Spa. I'll try to get an address and directions for you.Do you want a message, facial or both. 
 Tickets are free.   I don't think we'll need binoculars-seats are on floor. Enjoyed helping you over the week-end-that's what friends are for-at least where we came from.  The flowers you sent me are beautiful .. All of my favorites-gerber daisies and liliies.  You didn't  to do that with all of the furniture you gave me.  By the way-are your legs killing you.  My calves hurt like hell-think it's from going up and down the stairs barefoot on Saturday. I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.  Can't believe he didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.  Hey-we may want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green room. 
 Got the tickets today for Faith Hill-mark your calendar for Oct 13-starts at 8:00   Tina Turner is Sunda7-Oct. 29 
 that works 
 Need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us one day prior to noms due-that's too late to try to manage financially. 
 are you talking actual flows or what wAS NOMINATED 
 This was an EOL deal and EOL only trades in increments of 5000 so Zarin is not correct per our records. 
 I will let Joe know that you received his care package.  He will be very happy.  When I get my pictures developed, I'll send you any good ones that may have turned out.  It's O.K. to give Julie my e-mail address.  I would love to communicate with her.   Take care. 
 i switched the price on that deal and on 341270-they were reversed 
 Do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is assessed  reflects usage and not nominations.  Just don't want to be in a position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 20000. 
 This is O.K as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 8:30 C.T. and access to actuals within two business days. 
 Norm was somewhat prophetic when he kept talking about the "big hole in his pipe" that was going to occur if we went to rankings-little did he know-can't blame this one on rankings 
 You're not going to believe this.  I talked to Amoco and they confirmed that I did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay Agave Energy because tit's a complicated internal deal.  So we are both right..  I only wished Amoco would have told me ahead of time.  Bottom line- pay Agave Energy and not Amoco 
 I am getting your critical notices but when I click on it, I can't get access to what it says.  Is this a problem on your side or on my side. 
 this is a joke 
 Looks good to me.  Thanks.

 I do not track volumes but I will forward this to our scheduling group-Patti Sullivan 
 We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks. 
 email address  is jane.m.tholt@enron.com pager is 8005060869 I trade the west desk 
 no-I wanted my machine to make a sound every time someone traded on EOL but instead it's hooked up to my keyboard so that when I type the keyboard makes sounds instead. 
 Please add me to the critical notices for Transwestern and El Paso Pipeline(s) as soon as possible.  If you have any questions , please call me at 35539. 
 The sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard supporting eol which is opposite of what I want.  I want the screen to ding every time someone trades on eol.  I don't want to listen to my self type in deals on the keyboard.  My Enron computer system works fine right now.  If you could handle getting the eol problem fixed I would appreciate it. 
 Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you send them something. 
 How come it doesn't work on my eol machine? 
 We did two deals that day we bought 4.70 and sold them 4.67-same volume 
 this afternoon-any time 
 yes we are going 
 My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge and prices.  A bunch of them turn 50 next year and are thinking of going on a fishing trip.  Can you give me any more information on prices and availiablity for next year.  Please advise what is included in the price and where we  need to fly into.  If you have any brochures, canyou send them to me at Jane Tholt, 7502 Highland Farms Rd., Houston, TX 77095
