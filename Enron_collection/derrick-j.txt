 Per our conversation.  Jim 
 The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I have not.  In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key, took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his room!  It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately.  After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual. Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  "The name is Susman, my man, Steve Susman".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of "Susman, my man, Steve Susman" would never again cross.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any other way.  I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I treasure it.  All the best,  Jim 
 Elaine, do you know who Veronika Zimmermann is?  All of the e-mails I try to send back to her won't go through.  Could you call her.  Did you get the document back by FED EX?  Thanks, S

 Marc, I met this morning with an acquaintance, Eric Johnson, with respect to a product that he thought might be of interest to Enron. In our discussion it became apparent that his product is not an obvious fit with Enron, and he asked about the possibility of discussing the product with the New Power Company.  I gave him your name and number with the thought that you might direct him to the appropriate individual on the business side.  Jim 
 Michelle, thanks! Jim

 Please see the message below.  I would appreciate your responding directly to John Keffer.

 Mark, thank you for the message.  Carrin and I returned safely; we very much enjoyed our dinner with the two of you and look forward to reciprocating in Houston.  In response to your questions:  (1) the GCs will meet in San Antonio beginning on the Wednesay morning of the conference.  There will be no scheduled GC dinner the night before, but those GCs who are in San Antonio that night may get together for an informal one; (2) I enjoyed meeting Marcus; my only question relates to the amount of legal experience he has; as you know, we normally take individuals who have been practicing longer than he has practiced; if you are satisfied that he can do the job well, I will support your recommendation; and (3) I do not have any issues with either of the law firms you mentioned. All the best. Jim

 Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and your firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a great team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the best.  Jim

 Bill and Mary, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able to attend after all.  An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well! Let us know if your plans include a Houston trip--we would welcome the opportunity to entertain you.   All the best.  Jim

 Is this meant to cover invoices from outside counsel?  If it is, please discuss the proposal with Rob Walls.  Thank you. Jim 
  Vanessa, I will attend. Jim 
 Bill, thank you.  I should have mentioned in my earlier message that my travel agent did tell me about that flight, but I determined that it was not practicable to rely on it for two reasons: (1) if it were to be cancelled, I would have no way of getting back in time for the Monday meeting, and (2) if it were not cancelled, the most-of-the-night journey back would not leave me in the condition I need to be in to participate effectively in the meeting. I do very much appreciate your efforts.  My best to you and Mary.  Jim 
 Richard, I would like to meet with you re these claims and the others referred to in the message below to insure that we have all necessary information regarding them and have the appropriate legal counsel attending to them.  Thank you. Jim

 Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick
