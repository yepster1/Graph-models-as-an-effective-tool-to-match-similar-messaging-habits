 Mog,  As requested, here is the Socal file.  Please keep this within the company, as it represents a competitive advantage to Enron. Thanks.   Mat 
 Yan,  Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow Summary sheet:  PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.  Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier.  TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.  PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run.  El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because I don't think this is a cycle problem.  General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as pick up any intraday fluxuations.  As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report. These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting this report ready to use.  Mat 
 I have consulted my partner, and it would be great if we could be added to the reservation list.  Please pass this on to whoever. 
 I'm going to be working late, and I have some errands I need to run, so I don't really have plans, except that dinner will probably be around 8 pm or so.  Mat 
 A-eet 
 Tom,  I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually we need to fix the model.  Mat 
 As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going? Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go Syracuse. 
 Try to call me at work today and I'll give you the latest fare availability. 713-853-0472.  Talk to you later.  Mateo 
 Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands. Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.  Mat 
 Andrea,  I'm rotating as part of the trading track sometime before March 1st to the Gas Fundamentals Group.  I'll get you the required information next week. Thanks.  Mat 
 Sara,  Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into the phone?  Stupid drunk?  Mat 
 Mog,  Here's the Socal file as requested.  As I indicated, this information is a competitive advantage of ours, so it should stay in the company.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet. Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.  Mateo 
 Hey, I don't know if you've been reading any of those emails today, but please tell me we (as in me and you) can do something other than hand out with those fucking losers.  You know Mark's all over this fucking thing! 
 We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.  Mat 
 Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.  Mat 
 Brad,  What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the streets!  Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Mat 
 Sorry, I'm busy...work. 
 Kristen,  I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them (I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?  Mat 
 Tom,  Here are the two curve files for this year that I have downloaded.  Thanks for your help.  Mat 
 Tom,  Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time decision making.  Speak to you soon.  Mat 
 I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll just keep waiting.  Mat 
 Angela,  Try this one.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Phillip,  I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging. Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments are appreciated.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the necessary software as well.  Thanks.  Mat 
 so not even remotely funny. 
 Tonight my ass...call me now...713-853-0472. 
 Hey, just wanted to let you know I made $10,000 today (for me that is).  Just wanted to tell someone...it's for doing the trading track.  Mat 
 Ina,  I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know. Thank you.  Mat 
 Oh yes, I had a good time, although very exhausted from getting in late.  Did you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my wine stash was depleted.  Did you have anything to do with that?  Mat 
 Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know whether I should use it to get in touch with you.  Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed quickly.  Mat 
 Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are you?  Mat 
 try this.  thanks.  Mat 
 So tired I am. 
 Who are you? 
 Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of skiing!  I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.  Stay cool.  Mateo. 
 I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later. 
 Are you busy? 
 Did you have fun last night? 
 Hey, are you at work today? 
 Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering.  Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.  Have a nice day.  Mat 
 Cheryl,  I will be attending the reception on Thursday for the A/A program.  Thanks.  Mathew Smith 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Hey, I'm going to give your resume to this girl, and I'll let you know when to follow up.  Mat 
 OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

 Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :(  I just want to be loved....  Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call later.  I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off.  Mat 
 That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.  Mat 
 Matt, I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing.  I'm working this weekend so I'll give it a go.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system. The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad. Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for you..........................Adios. 
 Hola, como estas?  yo estoy malo. 
 FYI  How are you feeling today?  I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I=20 actually feel pretty good.  I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said I= =20 could definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the e= nd=20 of jan and his tour might be over!  still waiting to hear whether a=20 non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other year= . =20 I thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work down= =20 there.  Interesting.... anyway, I finally got signed up for the continental= =20 travel specials.  I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go to= =20 Louisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.  I'd take=20 advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its a= =20 little late to switch with somebody. =20  Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit=20 around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.  Later....=20 
 That is good to hear.  Give me a call today as you indicated.  Mat 
 Steve,  I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension? Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702.  Later dude. 
 David,  This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and "Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip. 
 Louis,  When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?  Mathew Smith 3-0472 
 Steve,  Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.  Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.  Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.  Take care,  Mat 
 Kristen,  Just wanted to let you know that I didn't get any emails from you last night or today. 
 Tracy,  I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still attend these sessions.  Thank you.  Mathew Smith 
 Kristen,  How often do you check your cell phone and email for messages?  Mat 
 Leo,  Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be happy to with a little notice.  Mat 
 So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole group on correspondance.  Mat 
 Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9. 
 Sure, unless I'm on a flight. 
 Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.  Mat 
 The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.  On American, the one's I sent are the about the only ones.  Continental has many available flights for about $35 more.  Mat

 Donde estas?  Tu no me escuche!  Yo necesito te hablar. 
 Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie. 
 Well, will discuss that later.  Call me whenever you want.  Mat 
 Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.................................? 
 Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you should so you can send me an instant message. 
 Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to refresh it manually.  It sucks....  So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.  Later.  Mat 
 Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.  I was thinking about old times. I can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically hear you yacking on the phone....or whispering to Jimmy.... 
 Jeanie,  I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Hey, are you there..............................? 
 Jeanie,  As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be interested.  See you around,  Mat 
 I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how this "track" will actually affect me.  Happy hour tomorrow?  Mat 
 Hey, I, for some reason, just got your email.  Anyway,  I'll try to call you later in the morning, but if you want to call me at work my # is 713-853-0472.  Talk to you soon.  Mat 
 Hey, you still coming to H-town? 
 no. 
 Seriously, you better fucking call me.  Mark's away and I'm lonely. 
 My response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks. 
 Damn it!  What did I say?  Do you read your emails or what?  I want descriptions!  I want chicks.  I need a chick.  I need a really cool  chick to hang out with. 
 Aah, thanks for the clarification. 
 new file:  Thanks,  Mat 
 Mark,  Did we not already do this?  Mat 
 Thanks. 
 Cool.  I actually left a message with Ted, but obviously I've heard nothing. 
 I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info. 
 huh? 
 Any news yet? 
 I need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that I don't already know. 
 Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since they didn't give us the technical tests. 
 Pablo,  Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.    Error 500--Internal Server Error From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1: 10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.   Thanks.  Mat 
 Mi casa es su casa.  I've got plenty of room.  Hey what's this I hear about you and Heather looking for a plot of land? 
 Abijeet,  Here are the ones I did for you to check against your values.  Thanks.  Mat 
 Awesome dude!  I'll definitely be around.  Hey, maybe you can bring my wine (or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).  Mat 
 Make sure you take care of Dave... 
 What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day this time...  Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.  Mat 
 Thursday definitely no...friday maybe.  Also Dave Shank is in town to work with Marine this week.  You remember Dave don't you? 
 OK 
 Brief,  Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day. So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold of you?  Here's some digits for you:  w.  713-853-0472 h.  713-784-8180 m. 832-444-7702 p.  713-716-0795  You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  El Presidente 
 I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large (I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.  With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,  Mateo. 
 Pedro,  I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I can do.  Mathew Smith
