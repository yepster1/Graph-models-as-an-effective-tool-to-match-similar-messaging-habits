 The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week.  Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.  Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.  A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002. 
 Transwestern Pipeline Company  Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor.  For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.  Northern Natural Gas Company  A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility.  EOTT A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit.  General  Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque.

 John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA= =20 permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.  First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours= =20 of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation= =20 because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20 Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20 applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20 triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that= =20 they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that= =20 they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t= he=20 time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need= =20 some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon= g=20 it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20 converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin= g=20 with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th= e=20 PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro= l=20 technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know= =20 time is of the essence.  Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and= =20 4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr= =20 or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm= vd=20 for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, = at=20 lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are= =20 40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we= =20 stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we= =20 applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented= =20 this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20 permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads= =20 and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20 conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with= =20 with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou= ld=20 bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.  =20

 Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines. We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me know what additional information you may need.   1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations.  2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.  The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.  3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.  4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas. Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

 Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal with them.

 NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY  Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE.  Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC.  TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY  A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.  A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased. On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

 The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below:  SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas.  SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.  Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on to Transwestern at 86%. 
 After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired.  Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.

 John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

 Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit issue:  [Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.  I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.]  I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, tomorrow.  Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits:  all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipment  This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.

 John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment from Houston.  Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second moring will be devoted to a  "surprise" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams. thoughts comments...... 
 Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to initiate construction at these two sites....

 John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip... 
 The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week.  Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.  Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.  A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002. 
 Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting= activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.  Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an= d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t= he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this= e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple= te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio= r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob= er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  = The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov= . 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat= ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is = the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b= een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc= ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas= uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu= el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t= hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal= yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa= s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter = emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.  Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f= or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has = also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T= here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c= omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat= e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign= off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As= of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per= mits for station 3 and or 4.  Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
 John, in response to you questions below, im da man.  Ill call you today or tomorrow concerning  your possible suggestions and recommendations for dinner, blocking the rooms and the time for the event....the group had originally planned on blocking out 70 rooms.  Enough for the field DES's, safety specialists, env. and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct reports, Rich Jolly and his advisors, plus guests and speakers.......anyone else? 
 Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the Midland Region.  A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they would be contacting us after they had reviewed this new data and information. 
 Leon, thanks for the list.  If this is a complete list of the parts which are replaced, what parts are "common" between the 3505 and the 4700?  Bill Scott is the attorney on this for Enron and I have copied him on this correspondence  "wcs@modrallcom."  Plese keep him in the loop on this...... 
 Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.  A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.  Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.  Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th NFL meeting in MIdland. 
 The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during the inspection.  The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00.  The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's next course of action.  The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston. 
 Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along with them....  Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues.  Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA. 
 The Southwest Region will be hosting its 2001 environmental roundtable in Albuquerque, NM on October 16-17 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.  Room rates are $89.00 per night.  Each attendee will be responsible for his/her room reservations for the two day event.  The agenda for this roundtable will be sent out in the near future.  If you would like to be a speaker and give a presentation on a topic or product please send to my attention for possible incorporation into the program.  In order to hold a sufficient block of rooms, provide adequate roundtable space and accomodations,  your reply is required to my attention via emal or voice mail (505) 625-8022 by September 31. 
 The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are on this. 
 Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK. If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility.. 
 Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area...... 
 The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector.  Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S.  The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S.  A custom fuel monitoring schedule  reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S.  Emissions fees were submitted for Laguna C/S.  A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.  The meeting will be held in Albuq. during the 1st or 3rd week in August. 
 Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20 status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9= 8%=20 complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the= =20 month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20 Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you= a=20 good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai= r=20 compliance. =20  1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan= ks=20 at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO= TT=20 Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20 listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank= s=20 listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,= =20 and 4 are abandoned in place.  =20 2. Permit issues.=20 Federal  a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a= re=20 the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20 tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)= . =20 This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS = 4.0=20 which indicated that in a:  5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7= 20=20 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t= py=20 working loss).=20  55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy= =20 working loss).=20  55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,= =20 255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3= =20 tpy working loss).=20   State=20  b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o= f=20 the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20 reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long= =20 as throughputs do not significantly change. =20  All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed= =20 after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20 Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank= s=20 store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual= =20 VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the = 30=20 TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary= ,=20 since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.  New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20 developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT= =20 tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize= d,=20 the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent= =20 than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati= ng=20 roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20 pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and= =20 the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20  4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20 requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20 required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20 warranted, and recordkeeping. =20  Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s= =20 identification plate or=20 strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20 search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t= o=20 start on this.  5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.

 I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future.  In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
 In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:  Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am  Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am  Jal team  August 8 8:00 am  Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am  I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022. 
 Be advised that there will be a meeting on Thursday 11:00 am August 23 at the NNG Turbine station, south of Kermit Tx.  to complete and submit annual certification reports which are required by the following Title V permitted facilities:  Seminole Brownfield Plainview  Spraberry  Irion Co. No. 1 Reagan Co. 2 Eldorado  Wt-2 Walton Keystone  Kermit Turbine  Should a team decide not to attend this meeting, be advised that the required submittal date for the annual certifications for the state of Texas is September 8, 2001.  It will be your teams responsibility to ensure that the certifications are submitted prior to the 9/8/01 deadline should you decide not to attend the August 23 meeting. 
 Kim, please give me a call at (505) 625-8022 concerning the above.  Im trying to generate employee interest in the RMEF and need some help.  Ive gotten some positive requests and involvement from some employees about the Foundation, but would like to open it up to others in Enron. 
 The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.  Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.  A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue.  Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine status of permit compliance with each air permit. 
 I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco. I will keep everyone apprised on the progress. 
 Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion.  In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle.  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing.  Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a conference call for sometime next week? 
 Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.  Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st s
