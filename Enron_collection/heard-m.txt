 Boy, I'm REALLY mad at you!  Just kidding!  I thought you were just going to initial the signature pages and then we would get Kevin to sign it here.  Since you're in town, I can run the originals down to you (if you'll tell me where you are) so that you can initial and then I can ask Kevin to sign.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Here are my exceptions:  8/17 - vacation 8/20 - sick 8/31 - vacation  Thanks! 
  Veronica:  Here's the Coastal States Trading, Inc.'s ISDA.  Marie 
 Carol:  Attached are the ENA/Enron Corp. certificates.  I was just going to work off these forms when (or if) EBS ever executed an ISDA. 
 Do we know a counterparty name or do I have to look at all our files? 
 I can't help this time.  The only Enron Corp. guaranty we have was issued in connection with financial transactions only.  Sorry. 
 Kim:  Attached are the forms I mentioned.  Let me know if they have any questions.  Marie 
 Roeline:  Here is the tax i.d. number for ENA Upstream Company LLC:  76-0318139.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Marie 
 Attached is Annex B to be attached to the confirms for Deal Nos. Y49003.1 and Y49036.1.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I believe all deals going forward.  Am I right, Max? 
 Martha:  Thanks for getting the changes to the form of guaranty approved.  Will you please have the guaranty dated effective as of January 1, 2001?  Also, who will be the party signing the guaranty, and when can we expect to receive the signed guaranty?  In addition, when  the guaranty has been signed on your part, will you please fax a copy to me at (713) 646-3490?  Again, thank you for your assistance on this.

  Tracy:  Can you prepare this guaranty for Pat Leahy?  The EBS entity will be Enron Broadband Services Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  As you can see from the e-mails below, they need this guaranty today.  Thanks!  Marie 
  FYI 
 Hi, Veronica!  I'm trying to clean some files off my desk and one of them is Bayer.  Are you still going to revise the credit?  Thanks!  Marie 
 We have received an executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of September 21, 2001 by and between Virginia Power Energy Marketing, Inc. and Enron North America Corp.  This first amendment increases the collateral thresholds for both Party A and Party B.  Copies will be distributed. 
 No exceptions.  Thanks 
 I think I received this e-mail in error.  I am in the Legal-financial trading group.  Marie 
 Diane:  We just sent drafts to Torch as they needed to send them to UOM, Dynegy and Sempra for review.  When we get them signed, I'll distribute copies.  Marie 
 Mark:  I would like to schedule this Friday, 10/5 as a vacation day.  Please let me know if this presents a problem.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Georgi:  We have an entry in our database that states that Energy West Incorporated did not change its name to Mercator Energy Incorporated.  There are two companies with the same name and this one is not the one that changed its name.  Our Energy West Incorporated is a Montana corporation.  The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation.  Let me know if this is confusing.  Marie 
 Hi, Diane:  In your spare time (HA! HA!) will you check and let me know the earliest outstanding trade dates for the following counterparties:  Catequil Overseas Partners, Ltd. Catequil Partners, L.P.  They are ready to sign the ISDAs.  Thanks!  Marie 
 You barely escaped our wrath this time, but there's always the next! 
 Hi, Todd:  Believe it or not, I am working on our comments to the ISDA and hope to have them to you this week.  If I see we won't get them to you this week, I'll let you know.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Brian:  The ISDA is being faxed to you now.  Marie 
 Cindy:  Attached are forms of Enron Corp. guaranties and related certificates to be issued in connection with ISDA Master Agreements between ENA and Catequil Partners, L.P. and ENA and Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd.  Please let me know when the attached documents are ready and I'll arrange for pick up.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Correct.  I just left you a voice mail re the termination. 
 Do you want me to take a first stab at these two agreements? 
 Attached is a copy of the transmittal letter forwarding the draft ISDA Master Agreement to Southern States.  Marie 
  Rotation, please. 
 Mr. Guinn:  Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching for your review a proposed Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement amending the existing amendment to change the Part 4 section references.  Please advise if the attached document is acceptable, and I will have two copies signed and forward to you for execution by Bank of America.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Diane, Tanya and Jay:  We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.  Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?  We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Russell:  Attached for review is the draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the Torch deals.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks!  Marie 
 We've had the lynch mob organized for some time now.  We're just trying to use the "kinder and gentler" approach for now.  But, if that doesn't work, look out! 
 Do you want to send it to Roeline or do you want me to? 
 Thanks, Diane! 
 Okay with me! 
 Hi, Roeline!  Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the assignments and terminations.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Our Confirmation Desk is in the process of revising the termination of ENA Deal No. NL0619.1 to delete the fee reference, and I will forward it to you when ready.  Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Gordon:  Attached is the Deemed ISDA and fax cover page for Deal No. Y61166.1 between ENA and the referenced counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 FYI 
  Linda:  Will you follow-up with Tanya in Credit as to exactly what type of documents you need copies of, or arrange for someone to go and look through her files?  Tanya's phone # is 33263.  Thanks!  Marie 
 She was going to revise the termination and bring it to me, but I haven't gotten it yet.  Marie 
  FYI 
 Where were you yesterday?  You didn't stop by to initial Allegheny.  Are you going to initial this before you go to London? 
 Tom:  You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,  Marie 
 You should have received a fax from me by now.  Have you not received it? 
 Yes. 
 Hi, Roeline!  I'm sending the original revised Termination Agreement over to you this afternoon.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Yea, and it needs to stop right now! 
 Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.  Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Roeline:  We would prefer to sign the fee letter at the same time we sign the assignments.  Yes, we will sign enough originals of all documents so that all parties can have an original.  Hopefully we can get this wrapped up tomorrow, as I will be out of the office Friday.  Marie 
 Barbara and Anne:  Below is an e-mail I sent to schedule a meeting with the confirm desks to discuss the materials we will need in order to start the review of the confirm templates.  Do you want to attend?  If so, I will notify you once I hear from everyone else as to their availability so that we can schedule a meeting that we all can attend.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Okay.  Why don't you let me know on Monday your availability for next week.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Dianne:  Thanks for responding so quickly.  It seems that we will be scheduling the meeting for next week.  Are you available then?  Marie 
 Joe:   Attached are the Deemed ISDAs for the two deals that were done yesterday with the referenced counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Attached is the Annex B for the referenced counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 This is an easy one.  1400 Smith, EB3803B.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Diane:  I hate to bother you since you're busy, but will you sign one more original of each of the two Torch termination agreements for me?  Torch wants a copy with original signatures for their file, so in order for us to have an original with their signature, we need to have two originals signed.  When they're ready, if you'll call me, I'll send a clerk down to get them.  Thanks!  Marie 
 What about next week?  Diane asked if we could schedule for next week as she is swamped and short-handed this week.  Marie 
 You're the best!  Thanks! 
  FYI.  We received this worksheet from Aparna for a trade with Interstate Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries? 
 Roeline:  Do you have a fax/phone number for Eric Twombly?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Mr. Smith:  Pursuant to Wendi LeBrocq's request, I am attaching a draft Confidentiality Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Sunlaw Energy Corporation.

 Sara:  I do not see a copy of an opinion in the file nor have we received one since I sent the execution copies of the ISDA to Steve Lins.  Marie 
 Yes.  I do have a meeting at 10 this morning, but should be out around 11.  Just let me know. 
 We have received an executed financial Master Agreement.  Type of Contract:	Master Agreement (Industrial)  Effective Date:		August 2, 2001  Enron Entity:		Enron Canada Corp.  Counterparty:		Albchem Industries Ltd.  Transactions Covered:	Approved for natural gas and crude oil products.  Not approved for pulp and paper, weather, foreign 				exchange, steel, interest rate and currency or forward rate.  Confirming Entity:	Enron Canada Corp.  Governing Law:		Province of Alberta 
 I did the comparison and gave it to Mary to review.  Credit is deciding what to do in light of the problems with the airlines. 
 Matt:  Attached for your further handling is the form of guaranty to be issued by Commercial Metals Co. in favor of ENA, guaranteeing obligations of SMI.  Please note that Commercial Metals needs to complete SMI's correct legal name.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie x33907 
 This has sound to it. 
 We would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, October 10 from 2:00 to 3:00 in EB38C2 to discuss the materials Legal will need in connection with its review and approval of all confirmation templates currently being used.  Please let me know if you will be able to attend.  Thanks!  Marie   Dianne S.  We will conference you in. 
 We have a scheduling conflict with our conference rooms.  Is everyone available from 9:00-10:00 Wednesday, October 10?  Same conference room.  Sorry!  Marie 
 So what was her beef if the copies were for our people? 
 Oh, please!  The exhibits should have been organized and conformed prior to execution. 
 Hi, Derek!  Any word on where we stand on this master agreement?  Hope all is well.  Marie 
  Another follow-up message re status of execution of master agreement.  Please advise.  Thanks!  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Hi, Tracy!  Where do we stand on Allegheny?  We really would like to finalize this master ASAP.  Thanks!  Marie 
 No, you can do power. 
 Donna:  I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?  Marie 
 We don't have to wait until the board meeting.  We do a unanimous written consent and circulate among the directors for signature. 
  I never received a response to my 9/17 e-mail to you re this amalgamation.  Are there any credit issues with respect to this amalgamation?  Thanks!  Marie 
 The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow from 9-10 in EB38C2. 
 Ms. Lemont:  It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc. signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.  Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the corporate documentation? 
 We have been advised by Mary Kay Lemont that Bear Stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature.  Will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on Enron Credit's behalf?  If so, will you provide me with a current list?  Additionally, is this the only position that will be in this account?  Thanks!  Marie 
  Arthur has surfaced!  But why he's plodding through it is beyond me.  He said he was ready to sign so that's why we sent execution copies.  Obviously he hadn't even reviewed the draft.  Go figure!  Marie 
 Sooner than January?  I'll let you know if I hear of anything.  I'm sure Mark H. is planning on you just integrating into ENA's legal group. 
 Susan:  Jorge Garcia on the interest rate and currency desk forwarded this e-mail to me requesting certain RMT masters.  Thanks!  Marie 
  Susan:  I think this is yours.  Thanks! 
 Yes 
 Mr. Guinn:  I have the Second Amendment signed by Enron North America and evidently deleted your e-mail regarding who I should send copies to for execution?  Will you please provide me once again with this information?  Thanks!  Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Enron North America Corp. Phone:  (713) 853-3907 Fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com 
 Jeff:  I have the documents ready to be signed in connection with opening the referenced account.  Can you assist me in getting them signed?  The officers who can sign are:  Any one of:  Mark Frevert Ben Glisan John Sherriff  together with any one of:  Rick Buy Rick Carson  Since we don't know the ins and outs as to why we are opening this account for this entity, Sara suggested that you or someone in your shop contact one of the officers from each group to explain the account and ask them to sign the documents.  Once you have determined who will sign, let me know and I'll take care of routing them for signature and getting them to Bear Stearns.  Thanks for your help!  Marie 
 Mary Kay:  I am routing the documents for signature now.  Will fax them to you when si= gned.  Marie 
 Gordon:  Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced transaction, together with a fax cover page.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 Mary Kay:  I am faxing to you this morning those documents that we have signed so far.= Will you send me your physical delivery address so that I can send the or= iginals to you?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Exceptions:  Vacation Day - 10/5.  Thanks! 
 Yes.  They are sending their originals to us so that we can put them all together and distribute. 
 Tanya:  Will you provide me with a definition of "Capital Reserves" which you used in the CSFB (Europe) worksheet?  Thanks!  Marie 
 If you are still in Houston tomorrow and get the urge to initial the ISDA, please call Samantha Boyd at 39188 and she will be happy to either show you where they are or send them to you (wherever you may be).  Thanks!  Marie 
 Rebecca:  Attached is the Annex B for Deal No. YA2985.1.  Please attach Annex A, Annex B and the Canadian Annex, since this is a cross border transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I had no interaction with her, so can't comment. 
 YUK! 
 Cindy:  Attached is a form of Enron Corp. guaranty that we are required to deliver in connection with a confirmation.  Please process this guaranty by the end of day tomorrow, as I must overnight it to the counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Cindy:  Mary Perkins executed an amendment to the Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of Bear Stearns, et al on May 15, 2001.  The original guaranty guaranteed obligations of Enron Credit Inc. under a brokerage arrangement.  Bear Stearns has requested a certificate of incumbency with Mary's specimen signature.  I have prepared and am attaching such certificate.  If acceptable, please have Mary sign and Kate (or another asst. secretary) certify.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Laurel and Jorge:  Attached is the form of confirmation for Credit Suisse First Boston London Branch.  ENA is the confirming party and calculation agent.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.  The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.  Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).  Marie 
 I am having it looked at and will 
 I am having it looked at and will send it down this afternoon.

 Hi, Robbi!  How are things going?  Any more news?  We have finally decided on our fabric and the amount of yardage.  What's the next step?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Hi, Roeline!  Just checking on the status of the original assignments I forwarded to you for execution.  Have you received them back from UOM, Dynegy and Sempra?  If so, will you send me an original of each for my files?  Hope all is going well and that you have a great weekend.  Marie 
 Hi, Sheila!  Can you verify for us the account numbers at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that we need to assign back into?  Thanks!  Marie

 Oops, forgot about lunch.  I'm available Monday or Tuesday.  Just let me know if either works for you.  Marie 
  Ed:  Attached are AES's comments to our draft ISDA.  Please respond to those which are credit related.  Thanks!  Marie 
 No, you can send them all together.  I was just trying to clean some stacks of paper off my desk and realized that I hadn't received the originals.  Thanks for your further assistance on this.  Marie 
 I thought you were going to come by and initial the master agreement.  I can't get it signed until you initial.  Will you please initial the two pages I faxed to you on 8/13 and fax back to me ASAP so that I can have the agreement signed here in Houston?  Thanks. 
 Richard:  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I am working on finalizing our comments to send back to AA today.  Marie 
 Todd:  At last, I am attaching our response to your comments of 7/19/01, together with a clean and blacklined draft of the ISDA Master Agreement for Georgia Power Company.

 Richard:  As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?  Thanks!  Marie 
 Richard:  Thanks for the info.  I'll send it overnight to her and will copy you on my correspondence (with a copy of our comments).  Marie 
 Patrick and Rebecca:  Attached are the Deemed ISDAs for the referenced counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.  Marie 
 I don't know.  Which entity did the weather trade? 
 Sounds great!  Sorry we won't be able to help move, unpack, babysit (or should I say "queensit") but unfortunately we'll be celebrating Anne's birthday (no, not her 34th!) the same day!  Hopefully we'll make it up your way next year to visit and most importantly, meet "The Queen".  Love,  Marie 
 Mr. Ellis:  Pursuant to your request, I am attaching for your review the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.

 Here is the executed masters list.  We will try to get you guys on the distribution list, but if we can't we'll just forward the e-mail to you.  Is there anyone else in your group we should add to the list?  Marie 
 That's fine.  They probably want the original.  Marie 
 I don't know who Debbie Nicholls is either. 
 I did and she did. 
 Hi, Roeline!  Eric faxed me a copy of the assignment and new confirmation signed by Sempra but I have not seen the originals.  Marie 
 We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the merger of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited, with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  I have received verification from Credit that they are okay with this amalgamation.  I will forward a copy of the documentation to Global Counterparty.  Marie 
 Cheryl:  We have received a certificate of amalgamation evidencing the amalgamation of Pacifica Papers Inc. with and into Norske Skog Canada Limited with Norske Skog Canada Limited being the surviving entity.  Credit is aware of this and has no problems.  I will forward copies of the documentation to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Marie 
 I wish I could, but I have a paralegal lunch today. 
 Cindy:  Attached are a form of Enron Corp. guaranty and certificate of incumbency to be executed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement with Pursue Energy Corporation.  Please call me when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pickup.  Thanks!  Marie 
  This is cute. 
 Hi, Robbi!  Hope you are enjoying your time off.  I know I certainly enjoyed Friday and Tuesday and hated to come back today.  Anne and I went to the Decorative Center yesterday, and tried to check out some samples at Beacon Hill (Robert Allen Fabrics) and they couldn't find your account.  Do you have an account there, or was I mistaken?  Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.  At Beacon Hill  (Robert Allen):  Pattern:  Bearnson Color:  Aged Gold  Pattern:  Scholtes Color:  Cinnabar  Pattern:  McGeary Color:  Citron  At Brunschwig & Fils (Gaston y Daniela):  Pattern No.:  82315-198 Name:  Chevron Woven Texture Color:  Teja  Pattern No.:  82315 - 401 Name:  Chevron Woven Texture Color:  Verde Agua  At Schumacher & Co. (Greeff)  Pattern No.:  3185017 Name:  Ephemera Color:  Grass  Pattern No.:  3185046 Name:  Ephemera Color:  Bittersweet  Pattern No.:  3112096 Name:  Alpine Color:  Pumpkin  If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo. They sell his fabrics there.  Thanks!  We really appreciate your help.  Marie 
 Yes, please.  Also, please add taxes.  We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.  Do you want us to pay in advance?  That won't be a problem either.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Well, I guess that's why they get to have such nice, pretty stores.  What's Eric doing up here meeting with the attorneys?  Also, Jane said that Mary Nell and Peter were given packages?  Is this true? 
 Do we have a conflict?  The CA will be to obtain financials.  Thanks!  Marie 
 Glad you enjoyed them! 
 I bet Mary Nell was made that they wouldn't let her come back to Houston.  I haven't heard anything.  I know that several of our lawyers and Carol have been meeting to finalize a Master Netting agreement.  There are some issues with the master netting agreement and some of the big financing transactions.  Maybe that's what they are working on.  If I hear anything, I'll let you know. 
 That makes sense since we have that SEC inquiry going on. 
  My sentiments exactly! 
  Did I send this to you already?
