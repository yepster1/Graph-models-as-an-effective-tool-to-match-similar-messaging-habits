 Hey, I hear you want an M5  (I know, crazy timing), but mine was just delivered today, and I'm not taking it--I think I'm going to get a new 7 instead.  Do you want it?  Jeff 
 Tom, go over and help Don. 
 thanks.  there is a mgmt. committee mtg at 11 am.  While I'm out, please be on don like you know what to find out where we are.  Jeff 
 I can't find you guys over here. 
 Hi Donnis  I hope things have been well with you.  I would like an idea of when you will be repaying me the $11,500 you've borrowed.  Regards,  Jeff 
 Bank of America and Sempra have traded with us online today.  Also, Morgan Stanley has called us and wants out of all long dated trades.  With morgan, we primarily have only financial trades, and will charge them to get out.  No cash out the door on these. 
 no, I'll have IT check on my side. 
 Thanks guys.  Any ideas? 
 Hi guys,  I've had a cancellation for tomorrow's intereviews at Wharton and was hoping you guys could fill in.  Please let me and Michele Nezi Marvin know as soon as you can either way.  Thanks.   Jeff 
 who is there now, and do you have a list of grads, or others who have interviewed in the past? 
 Hi Robert,  I could not open the file.  What are you interested in doing?  Jeff 
 where is the rest of the file? 
 for the time being, Ray is still going to run it. 
 Bill, yesterday you said you guys would email Con Agra's physical crude position for November.  I do not have it.  Jeff 
 If the interviews are 2 on one, then I'm ok with only one interviewer.  Remind me to look around on monday. 
 Hi everyone  I now have a second email address that should be used for all non Enron emails.  Please use jeffshankman@hotmail.com.  I hope you all are well, and I'm sure I'll be in touch shortly.  Best regards,  Jeff 
 Take a look. Sorry, you are on the list. 
 Hi Kim,  I have not received the salto yet.  can I get an update? please send it to my home.  best regards....Jeff 
 Hi Betsy,  Sorry for the delay.  What are you interested in doing?  Jeff 
 I know you didn't forget!  Yes, there is a LOT. 
 tomorrow is my last day.  Use jeffshankman@hotmail.com  Wacky world indeed.  J 
 yes, I know him and will call now.  Jeff 
 Hi Carole,  I won't be able to make it to NYC this week.  How could I put a reserve on it?  How would you feel about sending it to me on approval?  If not, what other ideas do you have?  Hope you had a great weekend....  Jeff 
 nice 
 can you find out where this is?  thanks. 
 hey bubbie,  hope you're better than me.  I am planning on beign in NYC somethime next week.  when are you around?  Jeff 
 Hi Guys,  I tried checking the tracking number, and it doesn't appear to be a valid number.  Can you check the number and send it to me so I can check.  Thanks...Jeff 
 Alan, where is the special narrative of my EEL board membership.  Should I resign from all of these companies immediately?  Jeff 
 can you come right now? 
 yes, last week, and I am going to be calling him again this afternoon.  How's it going? 
 please approve today 
 please print out now, let me look and approve today. 
 is this in the rolodex 
 please take care of this. 
 Yes, I'll send the check tomorrow.  Send all the pictures you have.  How low is the bench?  The Mies chairs I was asking about are the very classic chairs shown everywhere.  The back and seat chrome legs intersect and form a curvy X.  (How's that for description?)  Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  You have no idea how awful this is.  I hope no one I know (like) ever has to go through this.  I'm thinking about making the dragofly table a gift to the MFA, Houston, where is was just exhibited for 2 months in the Defining Modern show.  What would  you appraise the value as?  (Approximately, and of course I know it's not anything close to a fomal apprasail?)  Also, I've had 2 people approach me about selling it outright.  Any ideas?  Hugs.  Jeff 
 thanks.  I sent this to credit.  keep me updated. 
 I don't really know him.  I'm not sure he is the king, but I'll ask around.   Jeff 
 if I were a rich man....  or  I'll call you later. 
 Sorry for not responding earlier.  I'll give you a call tomorrow--I have no time for anything these days.  I'm off to tokyo sat for 5 days to meet with Tom Foley (former house speaker) and others.  Freak show on the business front.  How about you?  The wife?  does she have any sisters or friends?  hugs,  Jeff    "Ben Macklowe" <Ben@macklowegallery.com> 02/26/2001 05:14 PM 
 please put on calendar. 
 Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of these customers from the energy side already.  Thanks for your cooperation  Jeff 
 we need to proceed with pricing this, but let's help these guys understand.   Merritt Thomas                09/29/2000 05:27 AM 
 John, he did well with the gas guys, so lets make him an offer.  Get with m= e=20 and we'll go over the offer.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 will you follow up.  thanks. 
 please put on calendar 
 I haven't seen this yet.  any update? 
 I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.  We will need to do a good job (and have the ability to cross calibrate) understanding the other business units performance as well.  Jeff    Enron North America Corp.

 Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes. It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David responds to me call.  Best regards,  Jeff  P.S.  Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude, but I appreciated your being professional in your first email to me. 
 I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk.  What should we do with him?

 probably not, but thanks.  Jeff    Enron North America Corp. 
 Our analysts were covered during the summer, weren't they?  Why not use whomever was used then.  I thought you were going to change the A/A review process from mid year, since that was a disaster by most accounts. 
 We had submitted a list of PRC reps already.  Who is currentlyreviewing, and are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need? 
 great, I'm glad the intro helped.  He is very pro business and is excellent. Let me know if you need anything else.  Jeff    David Hoog 02/02/2001 02:40 PM 
 Hi, thanks for the update.  Per was in Houston last week,  and I've asked him to get with you soon.  Please call him (he should be expecting your call) at our office in NY at.   212-702-3910.  Would you also like to come to houston for a visit and interview?   Jeff    Nathaniel Jeppson <Njeppson@ALLENCO.COM> 02/02/2001 06:20 PM 
 Please expect a phone call from him.  He's in ny and a great guy.  Could you please do an informational interview in the office and see if there is anything EGM could have him do.  He is also going to speak with Jeff Donahue.  Thanks.  Jeff

 this was the guy that hired fred d'ambrosia back to enron after he was terminated for cause.  a.g. is an ok guy but i'm not in love.  i would however put him through the interview process.  i'll follow up.    Mike McConnell 01/30/2001 06:54 AM 
 Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in the hiring decision.  Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.

 In town, most of the time.  Is she ok?  (I didn't know about the Lara Liebman part, though) 
 Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all responsibility going forward.  I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.  Jeff 
 Did you see the second austin powers movie?  I just had lunch and I feel like Fat Bastard. 
 What a fun weekend!  Mine was a little boring.  Did you dance at the club before or after you ate all those burgers?  How's the pooch?

 Let's make sure she gets an offer.  Thanks.  Jeff

 Joe,  Saar Banin's work number in the UK at Goldman is 0207 774 6181.  He had been in metals for them for some time, and just moved over to gas and power (in the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top notch.  Hope all is well  Jeff  PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a sound from him..... 
 i do not manage an eol stack. 
 I'm an 8 of clubs, and a gemini; checking on the chinese animal sign

 i'm ready to go.  however, will this new system give a slower connect to eol, etc? 
 oh, i forgot to point out one more thing.  aren't you a dragon and mark a dog?  should i call the ghostbusters?  ok, i'll stop 
 was that last email the rudest thing i've ever said?  so sorry...... 
 so i had dinner with a college student.  could you break up with mark and date me?  that would be very helpful.  I really don't want to hear about someone's major for god sakes. should i put myself on ebay?

 did you call earlier today? 
 How was your weekend? 
 Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.  Also thanks for the update on the new car.  My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such activity.  I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such. Best regards,  Jeff

 Cool.  They sell their music CD's at the front desk.  They may even have two out.  Would you mind picking them up for me?  I'll pay you back, I promise. If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the hotel--it's great.  Also try to get a room overlooking the interior courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the french can. Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel. Jeff.  PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so.
