 Hey, I hear you want an M5  (I know, crazy timing), but mine was just delivered today, and I'm not taking it--I think I'm going to get a new 7 instead.  Do you want it?  Jeff 
 Tom, go over and help Don. 
 thanks.  there is a mgmt. committee mtg at 11 am.  While I'm out, please be on don like you know what to find out where we are.  Jeff 
 I can't find you guys over here. 
 Hi Donnis  I hope things have been well with you.  I would like an idea of when you will be repaying me the $11,500 you've borrowed.  Regards,  Jeff 
 Bank of America and Sempra have traded with us online today.  Also, Morgan Stanley has called us and wants out of all long dated trades.  With morgan, we primarily have only financial trades, and will charge them to get out.  No cash out the door on these. 
 no, I'll have IT check on my side. 
 Thanks guys.  Any ideas? 
 Hi guys,  I've had a cancellation for tomorrow's intereviews at Wharton and was hoping you guys could fill in.  Please let me and Michele Nezi Marvin know as soon as you can either way.  Thanks.   Jeff 
 who is there now, and do you have a list of grads, or others who have interviewed in the past? 
 Hi Robert,  I could not open the file.  What are you interested in doing?  Jeff 
 where is the rest of the file? 
 for the time being, Ray is still going to run it. 
 Bill, yesterday you said you guys would email Con Agra's physical crude position for November.  I do not have it.  Jeff 
 If the interviews are 2 on one, then I'm ok with only one interviewer.  Remind me to look around on monday. 
 Hi everyone  I now have a second email address that should be used for all non Enron emails.  Please use jeffshankman@hotmail.com.  I hope you all are well, and I'm sure I'll be in touch shortly.  Best regards,  Jeff 
 Take a look. Sorry, you are on the list. 
 Hi Kim,  I have not received the salto yet.  can I get an update? please send it to my home.  best regards....Jeff 
 Hi Betsy,  Sorry for the delay.  What are you interested in doing?  Jeff 
 I know you didn't forget!  Yes, there is a LOT. 
 tomorrow is my last day.  Use jeffshankman@hotmail.com  Wacky world indeed.  J 
 yes, I know him and will call now.  Jeff 
 Hi Carole,  I won't be able to make it to NYC this week.  How could I put a reserve on it?  How would you feel about sending it to me on approval?  If not, what other ideas do you have?  Hope you had a great weekend....  Jeff 
 nice 
 can you find out where this is?  thanks. 
 hey bubbie,  hope you're better than me.  I am planning on beign in NYC somethime next week.  when are you around?  Jeff 
 Hi Guys,  I tried checking the tracking number, and it doesn't appear to be a valid number.  Can you check the number and send it to me so I can check.  Thanks...Jeff 
 Alan, where is the special narrative of my EEL board membership.  Should I resign from all of these companies immediately?  Jeff 
 can you come right now? 
 yes, last week, and I am going to be calling him again this afternoon.  How's it going? 
 please approve today 
 please print out now, let me look and approve today. 
 is this in the rolodex 
 please take care of this. 
 Yes, I'll send the check tomorrow.  Send all the pictures you have.  How low is the bench?  The Mies chairs I was asking about are the very classic chairs shown everywhere.  The back and seat chrome legs intersect and form a curvy X.  (How's that for description?)  Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  You have no idea how awful this is.  I hope no one I know (like) ever has to go through this.  I'm thinking about making the dragofly table a gift to the MFA, Houston, where is was just exhibited for 2 months in the Defining Modern show.  What would  you appraise the value as?  (Approximately, and of course I know it's not anything close to a fomal apprasail?)  Also, I've had 2 people approach me about selling it outright.  Any ideas?  Hugs.  Jeff 
 thanks.  I sent this to credit.  keep me updated. 
 I don't really know him.  I'm not sure he is the king, but I'll ask around.   Jeff 
 if I were a rich man....  or  I'll call you later. 
 Sorry for not responding earlier.  I'll give you a call tomorrow--I have no time for anything these days.  I'm off to tokyo sat for 5 days to meet with Tom Foley (former house speaker) and others.  Freak show on the business front.  How about you?  The wife?  does she have any sisters or friends?  hugs,  Jeff    "Ben Macklowe" <Ben@macklowegallery.com> 02/26/2001 05:14 PM 
 please put on calendar. 
 Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of these customers from the energy side already.  Thanks for your cooperation  Jeff 
 we need to proceed with pricing this, but let's help these guys understand.   Merritt Thomas                09/29/2000 05:27 AM 
 John, he did well with the gas guys, so lets make him an offer.  Get with m= e=20 and we'll go over the offer.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 will you follow up.  thanks. 
 please put on calendar 
 I haven't seen this yet.  any update? 
 I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.  We will need to do a good job (and have the ability to cross calibrate) understanding the other business units performance as well.  Jeff    Enron North America Corp.

 Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes. It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David responds to me call.  Best regards,  Jeff  P.S.  Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude, but I appreciated your being professional in your first email to me.

 Our analysts were covered during the summer, weren't they?  Why not use whomever was used then.  I thought you were going to change the A/A review process from mid year, since that was a disaster by most accounts. 
 We had submitted a list of PRC reps already.  Who is currentlyreviewing, and are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need? 
 great, I'm glad the intro helped.  He is very pro business and is excellent. Let me know if you need anything else.  Jeff    David Hoog 02/02/2001 02:40 PM

 Please expect a phone call from him.  He's in ny and a great guy.  Could you please do an informational interview in the office and see if there is anything EGM could have him do.  He is also going to speak with Jeff Donahue.  Thanks.  Jeff

 Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in the hiring decision.  Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.

 In town, most of the time.  Is she ok?  (I didn't know about the Lara Liebman part, though) 
 Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all responsibility going forward.  I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.  Jeff 
 Did you see the second austin powers movie?  I just had lunch and I feel like Fat Bastard. 
 What a fun weekend!  Mine was a little boring.  Did you dance at the club before or after you ate all those burgers?  How's the pooch?

 Let's make sure she gets an offer.  Thanks.  Jeff

 i'm ready to go.  however, will this new system give a slower connect to eol, etc?

 was that last email the rudest thing i've ever said?  so sorry......

 did you call earlier today? 
 How was your weekend? 
 Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.  Also thanks for the update on the new car.  My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such activity.  I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such. Best regards,  Jeff

 Cool.  They sell their music CD's at the front desk.  They may even have two out.  Would you mind picking them up for me?  I'll pay you back, I promise. If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the hotel--it's great.  Also try to get a room overlooking the interior courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the french can. Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel. Jeff.  PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so.

 No problem about the book!  I'm sure it's a fun chew toy.  So it sounds like school is keeping you busy.  Let me know when you want to talk to my friend at Continental. I'm so tired from work--I'm going to watch a couple of movies tonight at home--the media room is all done with carpet, etc.  If you want to come over and watch movies and maybe eat that would be great.  Tomorrow I have friends in from out to town, a dinner on sunday for work, and I may be in London most of next week... 
 As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.

 Could you also include the following to all presenters:  Also, as part of your presentations, Mike and I would like each of you to identify 3 to 5 companies that we are not currently doing business, but should be.  (Sorry for the second email, Cathy) 
 No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 7:30. So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts? I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong time.  When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square. 
 Thanks for the updates.  They are great.  I have a question about confirmation process.  How many votes in the Senate are needed to confirm. The Dems are saying they may try to indefinitely delay hearings on Ashcroft. How so? 
 Thanks for participating in the first Traders' Roundtable.  If you have not read "When Genius Failed" by Roger Lowenstein about the rise and fall of Long Term Capital, I have copies--swing by and Jennifer will get you one.  It is a great read.  You will get a memo this week about the next meeting.  Jeff  P.S.  Phillip, no bid for the PAllen house.

 Great.  Thanks.    Jeff 
 Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...  Best,  Jeff    "Guarino, Carlo (C)" <cguarino@dow.com> 02/21/2001 03:13 PM

 Sorry.  First one is the 16th. 
 please correct date. 
 As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote aggressive ideas.  Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation. Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.   Jeff & Gary 
 Unsolicited from George.  FYI.  Jeff

 I was in La Madel. this morning  (Sun) having coffee and juice, and I thought for SURE I was going to see you there! 
 I called Jeff Donahue for you regarding a rotation in EBS.  Let me know if you don't hear from him this week.  See you.  Jeff 
 Thanks for the update.  I asked John Nowlan to give you a ring several weeks ago, and spend time with you.  Can you let me know if he got in touch with you?  Regards  Jeff 
 Schedule me out Jan 18, since my sister will be in town.  Also, what is this meeting, Tuesday Jan at 1 pm. Cross Commodity products? 
 Please schedule a meeting about the Dhabol LNG contracts with the following for wed or thurs.  Mark Haedicke, Mike Mcconnell (if avail), Vince Kaminski. Thanks.  Jeff 
 I think Prebon is out of the business, largely.  Have you checked with John Nowlan regarding which brokers he would suggest?  I'm not sure PVM is the right broker for all of our crude needs.  What about United?  Thanks. 
 Did you ever call him? 
 This is a tremendous 1980 example of a large Deborah Butterfield.  I think it would be worth seriously considering....

 If you take out the 24/7 book, there was no var violation. 
 fine.  thanks.   Do you have copies of les annees 30 or 70? 
 I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business. Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR  (I believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).  Is this a Board question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?  On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues. If you too need my help, let me know.  Thanks for your help...  Jeff 
 yes me and mike.  thanks.

 Very different hotels.  It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle of of the city.  (near vendome and concorde area)  very central to all of paris.  costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations.  Big lobby, lots of gold, etc.  Great, but not as cool/hip as costes.  How's London and the marketing of the 24/7 product?    Daniel Diamond 02/21/2001 09:24 AM 
 Have a great evening--I'm out of here! 
 Thanks for all your help with Sempra.  Hard work, but certainly worth it.  On another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.  Bottom line, we are not taking this hit.  It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 sure.  is there anything specfic you'd like me to address.  what about a slide presentation--which I generally don't love, but we have some good ones around. 
 What do you think of this:  As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.

 As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has committed over $1million during the next four years to University of Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.  In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends.  Jeff 
 Please make sure there there is no P&L or position effect in the crude books with the new 24 hour EOL product.  Thanks. 
 Marc Horowitz no longer works at Enron.  Please delete him from distribution.  Also, Please add Jen Fraser 
 I'd like a schedule c (or any other schedule we have) update.  Also, how do we start to accrue for bonuses for 2001? 
 How's the pup? 
 Yes, how should I proceed? 
 I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are talking to them about a number of ideas.  One of which is detailed below (from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.  I believe Carlo from Dow will be calling you guys shortly.  Take a look at the attachment and you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your businesses.  Jeff 
 Did Jeff figure out finally that they stopped taping for the show "Survivor" a few months ago?

 I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to restructure this contract.  Jeff 
 Soon, soon, soon.  Last minute changes to the house.  I'll probably have a big open house within a couple of months, but I'll have you over sooner.  My dogs are moving to Connecticut Friday, so after then.  Congrats on a great year.  Jeff 
 I understand, however, each book you assign to a trader will have a line so you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader.  Ok if you want to take over arb books, but they (positions and p&l will be your responsibility and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader) must be managed without the team approach of books prior.    The 1 million Var applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&l sheets.  I don't know how many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross.  If ross get's bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap.  Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around.  Later,   Jeff 
 Unfortunately I cannot be there.  What about Grey Whalley?  (Even though he is Stanford) 
 Niamh Clarke, Chris Mahoney, and Per Sekse are in Enron Global Markets.  You have them in the wrong business units.  Thanks for correcting.  Jeff 
 Starting tomorrow, Jan 3, the London Distillates book run by Ross Koller will have a max var position of  $1 million.   Chris, please take care of this with Ross.  Thanks  Jeff 
 The US/UK Arbitrage book, the Finland Arbitrage book, and the Products Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down, and no positions are authorized to go into those books going forward.  In addition, all positions in those books must be pulled out as of today, and I want them removed from the P&L reports I get.  Also, we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour, 4 cent wide EOL crude market.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 What's up with the ads for the NY times, WSJ, and FT?  (Crude and product traders)  Jeff 
 Let's send our a memo to deal makers, book admins, and business heads to remind everyone what the process should be regarding desk notification of big transactions/cash flows.  Why don't you take a stab at writing a memo, send it back to me, and I'll review.  Let's try to get it out this week.  Thanks.

 What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the Dhabol supply contract?  That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if necessary.  Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful.  Thanks.

 Sorry, you know how I like one word answers...When are you back?  There is a lot of info of the gas floor--ie handouts, that I'm not getting.  Your work is invaluable, and it is getting a lot of notice internally.  Good job. 
 Great.

 Should I send the book to your location? 
 send to lavorato for gas. 
 I have the book for you.  What is your location?  Are you crate training the pup?--I did and it is a great idea.  I have an extra crate if you need...they are pretty expensive so if you want you can have this one..... 
 Let's get together on this and have a conference call.  Thanks.

 Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan. He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the business.  He's our guy, and I want to expand his role in the group, as well. 
 Mike and I will not be available.  Can we move it to the end of next week, say thursday.  Jeff

 Candidly, Mark wanted to leave it open as to whom it would report.  He want= ed=20 to have control in it's growth and staffing, although it would be coordinat= ed=20 with Thor.  Mark (and I) talked to Thor about this a while ago, and will=20 begin weekly video calls in the new year about strategy, updates, new=20 products, and growing this business continentally.  (Mark was still concern= ed=20 about the members of the Oslo weather group that Thor managed poorly--in=20 Mark's mind).  I'm sure we will get to a point that works best=20 organizationally with Thor having a role.  However, when you look at the P&= L=20 of the business, is doesn't illustrate his support of the business, which w= e=20 are addressing. =20  Hope this helps, and you are relaxing a little....  Jeff 
 Please take me off the distribution for this report.  It is hard to read, and not terribly useful to me.  Do we need this report at all?  Jeff

 Crazy, but trying to chill.  I bet you're glad exams are over...how did you do?  Any plans for the holidays?

 I'm still here--they're trying to kill me. 
 Since only I know I'm not trying to offend you, that's all I can say.  I'm not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either  (I don't deserve it--I'd guess)  You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while. I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship.  I really want to see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.  I do know glen doesn't have all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only one these days.  My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go. I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize friendships.... 
 Macy Gray was just on CNN singing--she is great! 
 After talking with the guys, Mark is going to make paul murray an offer at the director level with a one year contract, with a one year noncompete. I'll let you guys work on preliminary numbers.  thanks.  Jeff 
 I saw you called on the cell this a.m.  Sorry I missed you.  (I was in the shower).  I have had a shitty week--I suspect my silence (not only to you, but others) after our phone call is a result of the week.  I'm seeing Glen at 11:15....talk to you

 FYI.  We also had Mckinsey  look at the soda ash market for us.  Not as compelling as we though, but interesting anyway...  Jeff 
 Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure it was fun, though.  Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message. I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN. (I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while) How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle? 
 Steel is not part of global markets, and if you could take it off this report, I'd appreciate it.  Also, Please add a section that shows new products as we add them to the portfolio.  Thanks.  Jeff    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please print following on letterhead:  Larry Kellner Chief Financial Officer (put rest here)  Dear Larry,  Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday. Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities. His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge research.  We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call.  It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier. Again thanks for your time.  Regards, 
 Great....Looking forward to it.  Jeff 
 get me a spot on the shuttle.  But I'll probably use a car service.  What time does this concert thing start, and can you get me all other directions, and info.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 I'll be out completely by Friday evening, and am finishing the list of workers who done various projects on the house, and will have that to you Friday as well via email.  I really appreciate your giving me the extra time....  Jeff 
 That glass of wine did the trick--I felt better  (more relaxed too!)  Dinner was boring--so I got home and had another glass of wine! 
 Hi Eric, hope you are well.  Do you know about this guy Nathan Hill that Clay Harris offered a job to work in dubai on dolphin?  Please let me know, he wants to get onl my calendar and hear about the LNG group, etc.  Jeff 
 Yes, Love to have dinner, either the 17th or 18th--you pick.  Let's have a drink at my house first so I can show you the digs.  Sorry I couldn't make it...last minute schedule problems...  Jeff 
 get with jennifer burns, my asst. and I'll say hello.  probably right after the crude mtg.... 
 Defcon 2?  I'm around until 4:30, and have an errand to go on, a cocktail party at 6 ish, and unkownd about dinner after that.  I'm around.... 
 No, he cannot come to the crude meeting, but I'd be happy for him to have a tour of the gas and crude floors and introduce him to some traders. 
 Your call on the bet.  I talked to my friend at Sat. Night Live, and she said no problem about being extras.  I'll get a list of scheduled hosts/bands--you pick!  (If that is still ok) 
 Hi Sarah,  What is your home address and work info....  Lots of hugs.... 
 Check into reservations.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 Any time you'd like to get here.  I'll be happy to set you up with a strong schedule. I'm glad you finally met Per.  He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the group and put him in charge.  Thanks for your patience, however.  Jeff    Nathaniel Jeppson <Njeppson@ALLENCO.COM> 02/14/2001 10:34 AM 
 Those dumb asses have now promised me my ab roller by tomorrow.  I explained to them our bet, and now they understand my problem...I WILL win... 
 How's it going?  Recovering from family OD? 
 Please also take a look at the resid curve/Pan Nat positions...Thanks. 
 So timely to receive your email today.  I was just thinking about you this past weekend, hoping everything was going well. 
 Please expect a call from Joe Hartsoe in the very near future.  His background lends itself to our businesses, and he is looking to add some commercial experience to his c.v.  Thanks for taking the time to meet with Joe.  Jeff 
 Great.  My asst is Jennifer Burns, at x39440 
 So the impaler might not have been too dramatic!  Have fun tonight! 
 How about Ali "the impaler" Saler?  Or is that too dramatic? 
 If I change my name to Mr  Crankman (for today only), I'll think of a name for you, too. 
 is this on the calendar? 
 Any pumping you can do would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Jeff    Joe Gold 02/23/2001 05:35 AM 
 Thanks for the email.  You make some good points. I'm still working with HR to address your bonus.  Thanks for your patience, but we'll get there.  Jeff    Niamh Clarke 02/14/2001 10:10 AM 
 When someone starts an email as you did, I think I have an idea of what you are going to say. 
 What do you mean funds are being told...?    Enron North America Corp.

 put on calendar 
 Thanks for your help

 please print 
 Did you mean to send this to Rebecca Mark, or Rebecca Macdonald? 
 I would like to discontinue service entirely.  Thanks. 
 No issues, and this will benefit Enron company wide.  It will come out of either Kristie Patrick's (in Mark Palmer's office) or my budget.  Jeff 
 Your thoughts are dead on.  Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road "officially".  By the way, rough is spelled roof.  Later.....  Jeff    Per Sekse 02/14/2001 10:14 AM 
 Yes. 
 Sorry it's been so hard.  Nothing meant by it.  To where are you moving? 
 fyi 
 I will be in Phila.  Please grab materials for me. 
 Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products. (Which I will remind you about frequently)  I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both respect your business sense.  As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.  I'm Jewish and our people have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.  Jeff 
 Thanks. Will do.  Did you need something the other day?  Jeff 
 Gary,  That was a great presentation.  Thanks for the update. 
 WHERE are my macadami
