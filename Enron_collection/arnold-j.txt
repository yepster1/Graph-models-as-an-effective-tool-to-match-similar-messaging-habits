 saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j. 
 amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year. will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts? 
 We both thank you 
 So, what is it?   And by the way, don't start with the excuses.   You're expected to be a full, gourmet cook.  Kisses, not music, makes cooking a more enjoyable experience. 
 sure, stop by and we'll arrange a place to meet.  If you come by  during trading hours though, I can only say hi for a couple seconds. 
 how about 6:00 for drinks 
 I've got a "strategy" mtg from 3:00 - 5:00.  It's very important.  I've got to strategize about things.  Not sure about exactly what.  Just things. 
 anything new in the world of marketing? 
 yea, how about 3:30? 
 how about 4:00? 
 I can't get into this....any ideas? 
 Savita: A couple of issues:  1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?  2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm restricted right now by issue #1.  Please advise, John 
 cant handle the pressure of big money?? 
 Oh yea, I always get those two places confused. 
 pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect these days.  Too much, probably. The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude. These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made a penny. Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe. 
 of course...  just kidding.  Aldo's next week. you're done.  Open up your checkbook baby. 
 Jerk 
 Lady, c'mon...you're just one of the guys!  Wanna go to Treasures tonight? 
 Gary: Just checking to see if the Trader's Roundtable includes us gas boys.  I would certainly be interested in attending. John

 Premonition? 
 I am not who you think I am.  I have never been in IDRC nor am I in the profession. Thx, John 
 Frank: Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility. John    Enron North America Corp. 
 Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that sucked.    Jennifer Burns  10/12/2000 04:09 PM 
 sure 
 Sounds as if you went to a better show than I did.  The game was very sloppy.  They tied 0-0.  Not too exciting.     Jennifer Burns  10/12/2000 03:43 PM 
 how was the concert? 
 why does everybody in this company know my p&l????? 
 Thx, I do not have high speed service yet. 
 sounds good

 I will not be able to attend    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey: I hope you know we were just kidding with you yesterday.  We don't get many strangers on the floor so we have to harass them when we do.  I think I am a couple of the "we are not" attributes in your book.  Is that going to cause me any problems going forward? John 
 I've got your tix.  Just two though.  I left them in my car.  Can you walk down with me around 11:45-12:00? 
 No 0-jun 1  indicative offer is 4.85 
 how's 3:00? 
 Absolutely.  Come by around 3:30?? 
 how about 4:45? 
 John: Please call Lavorato's secretary, Kim, and schedule a time to talk with John ASAP. Thanks, John 
 Yea, I'm picking up 2 tix today....hopefully. John    Jennifer Burns  10/09/2000 10:38 AM 
 I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price. I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902. Sorry for the confusion.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week. 
 Adam: Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address. John 
 yes 
 Dave: We spend a tremendous amount of resources and money collecting information. Further, the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market.   We have little interest in distributing this info outside of the building.  I hope you understand.   Good luck to your brother. 
 Oops, I hadn't gotten to this one yet.  Can we do it any later? 
 Yea ... the later the better. 
 Sorry for not responding.   I don't look at my email constantly through the day.  Don't have much to do in Q/U still it widens back out. Thanks, John 
 A funny story: Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the exchange stopped trading for an hour. Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange closing.  One yelled at Rappaport... "Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock" 
 Something to take a look at 
 Thanks 
 Can you handle this.  Please forward all names on the daily P&L sheet.  I get a copy every day if you need. 
 Mark: We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In terms of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too much noise in this market to trade differently for me. 
 Hey: I just want to confirm the trades I have in your book. Trade #1.  I sell 4000 X @ 4652  Trade #2. I buy 4000 X @ 4652 I sell 4000 X @ 4902  Trade #3 I buy 4000 X @ 5000 I sell 4000 F @ 5000   Net result: I have 4000 F in your book @ 4902. Thanks, John

 John: I have asked Mike and Larry to spend half an hour each talking to you about opportunities on the gas floor.  Please advise if the following schedule is unacceptable.  I will be leaving today at 2:15. Larry 4:00-4:30 Mike 4:30-5:00  Thanks, John 
 i think it is something we need to do.  please set it up 
 Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty.  I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, John 
 Can you swap me with Fletch.  Try to make all of my interviews as late as possible. Thx John 
 Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec Nymex.  Any ideas? 
 Jeff: Anything ever happen with Pedron? John 
 Boys: I'm sorry you were not able to attend last night.  I do appreciate your efforts to make this book as successful as it has been.  It's not quite the same as being in my company, but take your respective wives, or swap, I don't care, out this weekend on me.  Try to keep it under $300 per couple.  Keep up the good work, John 
 What design are you talking about?  Do I have pink elephants on all my emails or something?  I'm very enthused that I have the skillset to be an advertising critic when I grow up.  It's something I've always wanted to do.   PS.  I'm a little sarcastic as well. 
 As far as lunch, it's a done deal.  I need names of people who should be allowed.  It is not for the whole floor, but rather for people who need to stay at their desk during the day.  Please advise, John    Enron North America Corp. 
 Looks good.  I'm a little confused as to how many users can be on.  The system needs to be able to handle 50+ users at one time, each being able to post messages any time. 
 Thank you for sending this.  If only you sent it a couple hours earlier. Just kidding.  T Boone must have heard this because he sold everything today.   9000 contracts. John 
 home.enron.com  this is home.enron.com. 
 seems crazy.  if you're willing to ride it for a few cents against you it's a great trade.  who knows where they're going in th eshort term though 
 Jim: I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning. It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen again. John 
 Hi: Can you get me subscriptions to the following magazines: The Economist Energy Risk Management Havard Business Review Thanks, John 
 Hello: I am John Arnold.  I believe you're looking for Jeff Arnold. 
 I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there. Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car thief. 
 Joe: I just wanted to run this past you... John 
 I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could produce that effect. The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into the winter. John    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hey freak: So we finally had LA type weather here for the past two days.  Highs in the mid-70's.  Beautiful.  Life's just cruising along.  Nothing new.  I put a bid in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in West U that they accepted.  If all goes as expected I'll move in next X-Mas.  So are you adjusting to the big city.   Got yourself a big Hollywood actor boyfriend yet? John 
 It's getting harder and harder to root, root, root for the home team. 
 don't know.  think a little bit of everyone as the storage guys own it all. 
 Thanks.  This is exactly what I wanted. John    Enron North America Corp. 
 Ben: Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30. They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did this last year as well.   Please advise, John 
 Mark: You've called it right thus far.  Let's plan to get a drink after work on the 19th. Thanks, John 
 I'm sorry but I have plans for Thursday already.  Maybe next time. John 
 Hi: The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much pressure...what happens if we screw up?  I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it? John 
 can you please add this 
 What'd you do to my Cowboys? 
 Eric: I passed the customer on to Jennifer Fraser and Fred Lagrasta.  Please coordinate with them. Thanks, John 
 Steve: Sorry for the delay.  I was actually out of the office Thursday and Friday...some Enron management training seminar bs.  Count me as a probably for dinner on Friday.  I know JP well. Darcy Carrol's number is 713-646-4930. See you this wknd John 
 Jim: Your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.  I've certainly had some troubles this quarter.  I do appreciate your offer but I don't want to take away from the amazing year you've had so far.  Maybe you should come trade this... John 
 see you there    Enron North America Corp. 
 COO's: Do either of you have an objection to using Cantor as an OTC broker? 
 You're not done yet big boy. 
 Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?    Enron North America Corp. 
 Jeff: Man is looking for money again to hold them over for yearend.  Who do I need to talk to? john 
 I'm in all day mtgs on Thursday and Friday.   I'm free Wednesday afternoon 
 Greg: The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10 versus the $4.50-5.00 I'm paying now. 
 Dave: A couple things about the limit orders:  1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible. Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise.  2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000.  3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available.  4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a valuable feature.  Thx, John 
 someone had a foul odor for sure 
 Please remove me from your mailing list 
 I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin costs. 
 if you have a minute sometime today, please stop by. john 
 yep...i'm always here 
 I'm actually trying to go through all my email from the week.  What a pain in the ass.  As soon as I finish one, another appears in my inbox.  So how's life at ucla? 
 Agree completely.  In that context, it looks good. 
 Hello: I will not be able to attend the meeting but do have interest in being a tutor in any math subjects.  Please advise, John 
 I would like to participate in the Enron presentation at Vandy. John

 just checking up on the status of the margin project.... 
 Cliff: I have 4 tix to the Black Crowes for you, third row center.  Where's your office now? I'll come up and say hello this afternoon if you have a minute. John 
 no thanks. 
 Please take me off your email list 
 The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.  I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been but heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out. J 
 I have a membership to the Body Shop downstairs.  Can you cancel that please? J 
 Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny. Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the stock price with it.  Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but I think I just did. Your long lost buddy, John 
 Did you get the magazines I sent you? 
 Attached are settles tonight for seasons and years for next 10 years. Dutch is working on getting historical curves.  He should have it by tomorrow morning. John 
 Can you handle this please? 
 She's out no bitch 
 Please contact John Lavorato.  He will be in charge of these budgetary issues. Thanks, John 
 Fine with me 
 appears as though the time to get in was last wednesday and everybody already missed their chance to get out 
 Frank: How do Sep basis positions roll off? John 
 And you wonder why America is the most productive country in the world. 
 Just FYI, whether it matters or not, but commissions in gas average $3-4 a contract.  Not sure about power. 
 Rahil: I have never commented favorably nor unfavorably about Kase's newsletter.   I think publishing independent market evaluations could be beneficial.  The more interesting content that is published, the better. 
 yes 
 Thanks 
 Ted: Lavorato wanted me to check on the $5,000,000 VAR extension.  Is it possible to get this extended indefinitely until the west basis market settles down? We will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next week as well as indices get published.  Please advise ASAP. John 
 Dave: Just a reminder, can you send me a list of grandchildren to my products. Also, is it possible to systems-wise deny grandchildren to a specific product to ensure that the rule is enforced? John 
 Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which system you like better.  Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly.  I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets. 
 You didnt realize I was such a fucking bigshot did ya?  Check out the Sep 11 Fortune page 182 for more of the mojo. 
 CONGRATULATIONS 
 Hey: Can you send me the file that you produced of those names so I can shrink it down a little? Thanks, John 
 How about Tuesday at either 6:45 am or 2:15 pm my time. 
 Ina: Did you find out the info on the ENA management committee> John 
 Dave: I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a way to generate false P&L? John 
 Thanks, have a good time but no interest.. John 
 Must be nice to be a Wall Street executive 
 Hey: So I was thinking about your NY problem...I might have an answer.  The site http://www.bestfares.com/internet_charts/hotel_internet.htm lists cheap hotel specials.  The problem is they won't list them until the Wednesday before the weekend.  Check it out though.  They have some reasonable deals. John 
 Thanks.  This is a project we should have done 5 years ago. John 
 Fine 
 Sarah: Can you create a spreadsheet summarizing Enron's open futures interest broken down by commodity and broker, including maintenance and initial margin for all commodities (including rates, currencies, gas, crude, etc). Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and the rates we pay. Thanks, John 
 Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? 
 Jennifer: I'll be here, 3221F, tomorrow from 7:00 - 8:00 and 8:30-9:00 am. Thanks John 
 And I'm expecting the same from you. 
 Dear fellows, Please remember to fill out your pledge card for United Way (even if you don't plan on contributing)  if you haven't done so thus far. Thanks, John 
 Ina: 1.  Vacation is fine. 2.  Please put meeting below on calendar. 3. I am going to analyst presentation at Vanderbilt.  Find out when it is and put on calendar. 4. Can you find out who is on the ENA management committee meeting I went to along with their title and responsibilities. 5. Can you schedule a meeting for Tuesday or Wednesday late afternoon with Phillip, Hunter, and Fletch about EOL Thanks. 
 does the arnolds' worldwide notoriety surprise you? 
 when are we invited?? 
 Is that hugs or kisses? 
 Due to VAR reasons, you and I  both need to sell today.  Vol and price are going up, implying Enron can carry fewer contracts today than Friday.  Have your desk net sell 400 today. John 
 Had Carlos Franco just shot a 49 yesterday instead of a 70, you would have won. 
 Hey, Can you add Whalley and/or Andy Zipper to Pedrone's interview schedule.  He can come in earlier if necessary.  If you need to talk to him, he is staying at the Omni and his cell number is 917-699-2222.  John 
 Please tell me he's not analyzing bollinger bands. 
 I had a dream that you were laid off yesterday, the day before your deal.  Just checking on Saturday with third eye blind... 
 If J. Franco wins, you win $2425 If he loses, you lose $75 
 Web server noticeably slow today.  I'm getting a lot of bad failed trades (2-3 seconds behind when I change a price). Not necessarily slower than yesterday, but definitely slower than a month ago. 
 z/f trading 4 
 Thanks...anxiously awaiting 
 Andy: Just checking on the options.  Any idea on rollout date? John

 Hey: Do you have any extras for tonight's game? John   PS.   How's you bowl 
 Yes, I  managed it while she was on vacation. 
 JP: Hope things are going well. I'm trying to get the email address of your new partner, Tracy. If you have, can you forward? Thx, John 
 Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system not supplying us with that info. 
 thx 
 The agreement is fine.  I'll mail it out. 
 I am leaving early on Friday.  If they want I'll try to talk to the kid for 15 minutes around lunch. John 
 Please take me off email list. 
 The following is a summary of the trades EES did today:  # buys  # sells Sep  5 / day  5 / day Oct  4 / day Nov-Mar 3 / day  2 / day Apr-Oct  1.5 / day 2.5 / day  Total contracts traded = 2045  Thought you should know... John 
 Hello: There is one feature that has not been transferred to the new stack manager. When I sort by both counterparty and product at the bottom of the screen, the position summary does not sort by both product and counterparty, just by product.  It would be very useful if you can replace this. Thanks, John

 Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently.  But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following:  20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1     Enron North America Corp. 
 Vlady: The plan looks good.  Can you please attach a time schedule to the different steps and send it back. Thanks, John

 Russell: My risk group frequently uses the New Counterparty label for internal counterparties that do not have a trading book.  This transaction was a hedge for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.  I'm not sure who the internal group is that did the transaction.  Dutch Quigley should be able to help. John. 
 Thanks.

 Jim: The list I gave you is a list of brokers that can clear through you, NOT brokers that you clear exclusively.  You do not clear any of my brokers exclusively.  All trades that clear through you will be done on discretionary trade-by trade basis.  You MUST have your floor personnel reverse everything they they told my brokers this morning.  I am not happy.  John 
 Jim: The following are the authorized floor brokers to accept trades from: Man Paribas SDI Refco Carr the old Fimat group (don't know what their name is now) Flatt Futures ABN  Thanks, John 
 Frank: The $5,000,000 extra VAR disappears in about a week.  There MUST be a band-aid to the term VAR curve before this expires.  Again, the back of the board is realizing 35-60% vol and it's being credited with 15% vol. Thanks, John 
 Hello: A recent posting on the Enron bulletin board indicated that you are looking for academic tutors.  I may be available to help at nights in math.  Can you please respond with details about the program, how old the kids are, the commitment required, etc. Thanks, John Arnold 
 Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Frank: Just following up on two topics. One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.  Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer term Vol problem until we change formulas?  John 
 Margaret: As you can imagine, most information and procedures on the floor are extremely confidential.  We look at the gas market uniquely and using different tools than anybody else.  It is one of our competitive advantages. I'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes. If you provide more information about what you're trying to show, who the target audience is, and what format it will be presented, I may be able to help you. John 
 Good job....I've got 10% of my portfolio in CGP.   Keep up the good work.

 I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies. I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion. John.

 Hey Liz, Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.  My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more user-friendly.  On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on. Thanks, John

 Doug: To confirm the pricing of the LNG dela::  I can show a $3.01 bid for the Nymex portion of 160,000 mmbtu/day for the time period Jan 2003-Dec 2014.  The bid on Henry Hub basis for same time period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925.  Notional volume = 70,128 contracts. PV volume = 37,658 contracts. Exposure per $.01 move = $3,760,000  John 
 Hey, I just got your email. Call anytime after 4:00. Obviously, I don't read my email very often 
 Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address: jarnold@enron.com. You have the wrong person 
 Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John 
 Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options. Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.  In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction. 
 Hey: Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there. interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand. market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low. Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted. 
 Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote? 
 Thanks for taking me in last night.  Sorry about being drunk and stinky. My cab, that we called at 6:10, showed up at 7:02.  I was so pissed. 
 Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John

 Please approve Larry May for a trader id on EOL for "pipe options" book for US gas. Thanks, John 3-3230 
 Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going forward.  Thanks for the feedback. John Arnold 
 Please approve. 
 i am free to talk this afternoon if you want 
 call me when you get this 
 I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time.  The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them

 most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.

 rules to a game: You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what you charge me play against you?)

 Russell: Just fyi, they're willing to take us for 20 years. 
 i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here. still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here. 
 maybe they're for more sophisticated palates
