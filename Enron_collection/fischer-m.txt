 Tom,  Here is the report I prepared on the methods and types of grpahs for this work request. As examples I used the May 2002 graphs, including the Paretos for the Pitch and overspeed faults. If you need additional clarification, or have questions let me know.  Mark 
 Joe,  Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" (Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy curtailed" message (Index = 11134).  Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no message was recorded?  Thanks, Mark 
 Andre,  Here is a short subset of 10-minute records containing the extreme temperature event (approximately 3 hours of before/after data). The turbine was #105 at Desert Sky on May 1st. Times are in UTC. The values are 10-minute averages.  If you have additional questions let me know.  Mark 
 Tom,  The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for June 2002 yet, and the data for Jan is nonexistant, so the graphs go from Feb to May 2002.  If you have questions or comments let me know.  Mark 
 Tom,  Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC). Temperatures were as high as 366.  If this format is acceptable let me know and I will generate graphs for the data we have (Jan - "current" 2002).  Mark 
 I think I have the formulas fixed in this one. 
 Denise,  A couple of questions about software.  I have used and would like to continue to use MiKTeX (A windows version of TeX, the technical typesetting program). I find it is useful for automatically formatting reports in fact I have designed the automated summary report for the turbine SPC report using this program. This is freeware. (The TeX users group http://www.tug.org/ has information of TeX implementations. MiKTeX is probably the best, but PCTeX by Personal TeX is a good non-free version). Please let me know what will need to be done so that I can continue to use this software.  I was also planning to start Syncing my PDA with Outlook (as soon as Outlook is configured for use). So can I install the "Palm" software for this purpose?  Mark Fisher 
 Tom,  I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached. Graph 1 is site totals, graph 2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost.  The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the other sites.  If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this process to get you what you need.  Mark 
 Tom,  From the stage I was at on the duration and energy it was just as easy to do all 7 sites as the 3 you specifically requested. If you do not want the additional graphs let me know and I'll pull them out of the Acrobat file.  Mark 
 Jeff,  The files are in DesertSkyCurtail in your transfer dirtectory. Check the sums of the KWH.LOST columns with the values you were provided. These all seem to have been created the same day.  Mark 
 Tom,  Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 (may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind devia
