 we did not discuss this today. Let's get together on Tues and spend 15 minutes on this subject.  BT 
 Rumor has it that Paramount had signed up for the short term emergency firm on Kern.... not that it matters but I was wondering if that was true.  If so, he may want to hedge this pipe and you guys could spin some orig off of it.  TIC 
 thanks, I appreciate it. 
 Further to our conversation, pls release $ 1,004,000 US funds to the Canadian Orig Desk Head, Eric Ledain.  These funds will come out of the prudency account that has been set up to distribute these payment obligations.  Gerald, I would like to raise a confirm between ENA and ECC that stipulates why we are paying them these amounts.  Total payment was in consideration of ECC syndication of PCHC and Misako of which the granted amount on Misako was $ 200,000 .   If there are any questions, give me a call.  BT 
 Your the king... I will wait for your voicemail.  BT 
 David, further to our conversation, can you advise on the history of an ex employee named Steve Horn.  I believe he came from the the Finance group.  I would appreciate any off the record comments you can provide. My phone number is 3-1587.  BT 
 Bill, just following up to see if the MTM reports that are being provided to you are working as you require. Format, data etc.  If there is anything else on this, call me.  BT 
 Mark, In my discussions with Lavorato, he has asked us to provide a summary/outline of the business operations of each of the co's that we have syndicated this capacity with.  Set up your summary that includes, Co. Name, Principal, primary business, dealings history ( if any ), number of employees, contact name of deal maker.  Cannon, Patina, FMI Weld, Huber,Misaka  Don't spend too much time with this, but a little history on each co. is what John wants for his review.  Thanks, BT 
 Glad to hear about the vegas grouping.  Rumor has it that you and i are bunking together... John thought you might want to share a king bed but until we get to know each other better, we should get two queens.  Can you look after getting us a room.  I have not stayed at the belagio, should be nice.  I will call you sometime tues.  See you on friday around 6:00 pm.  BT 
 Paul, I have moved down to Houston and am now running the gas marketing group for the west.  I will forward this note and talk to my Canadian Counterpart, he will follow up as required.  Thanks for the note... I am sure you are glad school is coming to the end.  Regards,  Barry Tycholiz 
 I sat down with the tech guys and wrote down every word... it seems to work fine. Perhaps a little slow but not that bad.	BT 
 Sorry, I was unable to catch up to you on the weekend.  Look forward to hearing about Austin.  My grandmothers prayers are on tues night. I will be home on Weds. around 6;00 and then off to San Fran and L.A. on thurs/ Friday.  What are the plans for the weekend ?  I might need a raise if I am going to Jet around the country like a rock star..  Anything in the markets that I should be aware of ?  Talk to you later.  BT 
 Pls postpone install date until further notice.  I will advise pablo or yourself as my schedule becomes available.  BT 
 pls remove me from your distribution list. thanks.  BT 
 I don't know if I sent you a note on this already but pls postpone install date until further notice. I am unavailable for the rest of the week.  Barry 
 This packages will always be a work in progress ....make sure that the message that you are intending to deliver is delivered so have a wrap up slide(s) that brings the whole thing home and leaves your customers with a summarized version of your presentation.  Kim, I would like to use this format in our discussions with Long Beach and Palo Alto... In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the material is in the format you would like.  Also, our discussions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of this data but not enough to bring in recommendations.  As part of our discussions, we need a section on Risk Management Services, historical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommendations on some risk management products and then next steps slides.  Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outsourcing of some of their load.  I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term and short term incentives on their price vs Socal.  I will call you on Tues. a.m.  BT 
 What ended up happening with this capacity.  Did we show a bid of any kind.  Even if we have to warehouse this we should be able to.  BT 
 Pls throw the tires out.....or make planters out of them.  Tic 
 My game has signs of life..... can't break 80.... I am up in Canada right now... grandma passed away.... I am very much looking forward to the june trip myself.  BT 
 I received your voice mail and I was aware of the ruling in Nevada... Like yourself, I am pleased.  Gerald has raised the amending lanuage and I will review this week. BT 
 Not really because I am going to get access to Telerate.. either one is ok by me.  BT 
 The Enron stock that I sold was in US funds.  I then coverted it to Canadian $'s and that is what is on my T4.  The equities that I owned did include Communications System International, and I think that is it.... However, I am travelling and unable to confirm this for you until Apr. 24. or so.  If there are any questions, pls contact me via this address.  regards, bt 
 Pls defer the install date....until further notice.  Thanks  BT 
 Due to some changes in my schedule, I would like to deffer the install date.... I will follow up with Pablo once I know what that new schedule looks like.  In terms of supporting my click at home... I don't really care if it is supported or not, but I require complete access to my work files, notes 
 Let's cancel the meeting for this monday.  thanks. BT 
 That's good news. Thanks. 
 Yes, we can make that payment for any date.  Let's raise a letter amending the payment from 30 days to whatever date he wants. BT 
 Jessica, I will probably not be in on Thurs as I am traveling to Winnipeg for the next few days.  At this time, I do not have a cell phone number where I can be reached at... but I will get a number to you.  Please direct my calls accordingly and any messages to my main line. I will check this on a regular basis.  Thanks, BT  I will call you thurs. a.m. 
 Tanya, here are the draft confirms that we have negotiated with Sierra. I am also going to add some specific language regarding delivery point and pro-rata cuts.. and you guys need to work with gerald and put in netting / set off language that you feel protects our interests.  As an aside, I talked to the commercial person at Sierra and advised them that we will be amending this draft again to incorporate Netting provisions and she advised me that that would not be a problem.  Thanks.  BT 
 Bill, the language that we have used for discounting had a 200 basis point amount attached to it. It should not be included based on our last conversation.. If this is going to be attached as a schedule  then it still needs to go through some changes.  The calculation, summary page is almost complete.  BT . 
 Gerald, rather than say mid month.... define the language to say... start date shall be Aug 1.  in the event that the start date is delayed past Aug 1 and prior to Sept 1, then the start date shall be Sept 1.  This can be rolled for another month.  BT 
 what is my login userid. 
 perfect... thanks. 
 forward to the attention of Dean Drozdiak 
 Gerald, here is some language that we have used in the past. I have adjusted it to reflect ENA. If there are any other changes, please do so. Otherwise, Sandy is will attach this to a file we are sending out with some historical numbers.  Pls note: IF there are any changes, copy me on them and I will update my file.  BT 
 I did not receive this as far as I know... pls check with Jessica 
 Marg, you had co-ordinated for me the L1-A visa I acquired to move from Canada to Houston.  I need a lawyer to assist in the preparation and filing of a Visa for my spouse. She has been advised to pursue a visa called "TN" which would allow her to work as a registered nurse. Apparently under the US - Canada free trade agreement, she can acquire this visa which is supposed to be low cost and easy to get.  Can you advise as to the best route to get this underway.  Thanks, Barry Tycholiz 
 We are building a model this a.m. to test calculation assumptions.  Has PG&E asked for any clarification or changes to my proposed calc.  I will have confirmation of the calc first thing this a.m. ( monday )  BT. 
 pls calc as per our conversation.  BT 
 You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.   BT 
 Jessica, can you follow up on this request pls. 
 Gerald, here is my cut at the calculation. As discussed this needs to be sent to PG&E, Peter.meier@neg.pge.com when we are ready to show them calc.  also, copy steve vanhooser.  BT 
 I am the originator and VP for this capacity. BT 
 there were no taxes withheld on the sale of these options. BT 
 My arguments remain the same regarding gas coverage. I believe that gas coverage responsibilities belong to west gas.  This coverage should be transitioned over to a marketing rep in west gas, and I would like that to be you.  Comments.  BT 
 Can you please add the PG&E topack curve to the swap model. thanks.  BT 
 Paul, I was going through some of my notes.. did you ever get anywhere with Piper Energy in Calgary... Boyd Macdonald is the contact there.  BT 
 I had a message you called me... if you still need to reach me, give me a call at your convenience.  713-853-1587.  BT 
 Judy, attached is a summary report I received from Enron. Please disregard the information I had submitted in the organizer.... as it is incomplete.  I gave up on that system because I was unable to put in decimal points...  This is the complete list of ENRON Corp stock that I sold in 2000 and has all the relevent information on it.  Call if there are any questions.  BT 
 I have read the agreement, believe we need to hold the recall rights as per El Paso's direction, however let's discuss.  Call me when you are ready to meet.  Note:  Bill, I would like to discuss with you the possibility of reducing the " Capacity" in consideration of PGE selling us outright the citygate gas...  BT 
 My W-2 in Dec was $63,250.  Also, I am in my organizer as we speak.... I may have missed some of the options information and am rechecking.  BT 
 Kim, I think this is the form you need to complete. Can you download and print... I have also made a hard copy of this and will bring it home tonight.  Just go in and click on this web site.. and then print this form off on our computer. You can access as follows.  www.irs.gov then click on forms then go to form 1099 W-7.. this should be it.   http://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw7.pdf   BT 
 Pls have dave set up with a secondary screen for his desktop.  Barry Tycholiz 
 Judy, what is the proper mailing address in Calgary that my supporting documents should be sent to.  Also, should I include a blank cheque to you for payment to the Canadian Taxes or do you want me to wait until we know what the amount is.  Thanks. BT 
 Thanks for the note... I am away during this period but I may have Kim Ward take a couple of my customers... I will get back to you. Thanks.  BT 
 Thanks... BT 
 please verify that we have 4 rooms for next monday night... at the Westin St. Francis... also, can you make a dinner reservation the restaurant Kuleto's which is at the Villa Florence.  8:00 PM reservation time.... 5 people. 
 Barry - order the 4 DVD's from Columbia House.com 
 Any chance on the document today?  Yes, we can live with it... and the shippers should be ok with it as they will look to us for any charges. However, I still question why this is required as there should not be any prior issues related to this capacity.  BT 
 good stuff 
 I have called.... everyones phone rings and rings and rings.... 
 Sorrry I missed  your call.... I am in all day today. Call me back if you need to speak with me.  BT   3-1587. 
 Did you get all the numbers on TSA's... I have a few but I don't believe I have them all either.  BT 
 Bill, you would have to structure your paper with PG& E such that their MTM amount computes to an amount of capacity assigned to us to handle this position.  With EL Paso having receipt point flexability, but subject to change we must be very careful in our bid assumptions on this pipe that we would be assuming as a result of this.  As i had said yesterday, San Juan receipt point status is a lot cheaper than Permian... and changes the economics considerably.  BT 
 Kim, the Astro's only play June, 1,2,3.. and then not again until the 15th... I have the tickets for 1,2,3.... if that influences your dad at all.  He should come down that weekend.  BT 
 Dorie, is there a different charge for one day vs the next?  ( you us Canadians, always looking for the deal ).  Barry 
 Tyrell, what is status of documents.  Call me on my cell phone. 713-302-6442. 
 Jim, good to hear from you.  Glad to hear that everything is going OK.  My transition down to Houston has all in all gone pretty good.  We settled in pretty quick at home and Kim is being quite a trooper regarding her home life although I know she misses outside interaction. She may be able to work soon so this should help keep her busy.  Work has been exiting, the West US markets have provided good opportunities to me and I am slowly making my way to meet the customers.  I could easily spend every day on the road.  I have loved the winter.. hilight has to be no snow to shovell... but I will pay the price for the summer because you can't do anything when it is a 100 degrees.  Better run,.... drop me a line sometime... and if you are ever getting your way down this way, call first, we will get together.  BT 
 We are booked to play the TPC - Pines course on  Friday A.M. at 10:20 AM... then over to the house for dinner on Friday night.  I can pick you guys up on Friday am. our home number is 713-667-9556.  Call me when you get in on thurs. evening.  I have booked  a time for 3 people.  That should be it.  BT 
 Further to our meeting in Denver.... and as agreed, we are going to create a consolidated fundamentals package that will be maintained, controled and distributed by our group.  This package will form part of all of your outgoing conversations with customers and will be set up in such a way that it can be customized for each customer group, buyers or sellers.  In short form, the information package will include:  *	Supply:		Complete historicals and forecasts for WCSB *	Demand:	historical demand broken down by tradeclass, region, *	Transportation:	historical loads, basis transport values, expansions etc *	Generation:	gas fire
