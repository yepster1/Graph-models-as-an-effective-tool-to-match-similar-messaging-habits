 http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/11/05/gen.attack.on.terror/index.html   CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif. 
 Here is the position summary as of Feb 2, 2002 
 A ok for me 
 jzufferli@shaw.ca, it has changed from jzufferli@home.com 
 can you explain to me what data you are pulling for canadian fixed price positions in the report, it showed chris lambie selling 1200 contracts yesterday.   my records indicate chris sold 145 nymex contracts yesterday.  in general the data (i.e including the var calc) is questionable relative to my reports. 
 That is good 
 Looks ok 
  When you get it can you come talk to me about this   Thanks

 I have no memory of receiving this info.  Can you send me another? 
 derek can you forward me the e-mail for the management conference?  my e-mail puked and deleted everything in my inbox. 
  I want to install some reporting measures on position limits and VAR metrics here in Canada.  Can you give Brian Gillis the necessary access so that he can prepare the reports for me.  If you have any questions give me a call ? 
 looks neat, maybe needs some other coloured wall paint to personalize it 
 There is nothing in my inbox.  I have no form to sign.  Could you deliver me one please? 
 I never wrote nor implied that I was intending to hedge currency exposure with a third party.  I implied that I will hedge with you guys when and where I deem appropriate in the term structure. 
 Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/ 
 Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

 Once again , the EOL report is ignoring the new customer list that I have given twice now.  They seem to insist that the the Canadian subs that are now tradinig Alberta power that have traded other products on EOL are
