 Great.  Just what we needed. 
 This is to advise you that we will NOT have ETS Monday morning staff meetings on December 18 or December 25.  Please make note that the next ETS Staff Meeting will be held on Tuesday, January 2, 2001 at 9:30AM in 49C2.   And then on January 8, we'll resume our regular schedule of having our staff meetings on Monday mornings at 9:15AM.  Regards and Happy Holidays, Cindy X36197 
 I look forward to hearing about the new romance stuff!!  Hope to see you soon. 
 I am very happy for you.  It sounds as if everything in your life is going in the right direction.  I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for Joe.  I am sure you will learn alt.  Also, thank you for remembering Jason and Jessica's 1 year birthday.  The designer T-shirts were great and they look really cute in them.  That was very thoughful of you to remember.  Good luck! 
 Thank you. 
 Peggy:  Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three Plans in a relatively short period of time.  Stan 
 Please see below information for Stan Horton.     Enron Technology 
 Tomorrow is best for me.  I will make reservations as Massas across the street.  Does that work for you.  Around 11:45?

Cindy 
 I am open for luch Wednesday and Thursday.  Let me know which fits your calendar the best.  DK did tell me about the Mark Marin tournament.  If your Mom saved the paper let me have it for reference.  Did you see the Sunday paper RE: the 100 highest paid executives in Houston?  Dad 
 I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.  Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?  Thanks. 
 There is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion date or a note that it is completed.  Can we get an update? 
 Cindy double checked.  We are ok for 8:15 on Sunday 
 I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.  Actually this is somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts. 
 Will do....have a great game! 
 Hello, Steve!   Thanks for the alert!    I did just call the Pro Shop one more time and spoke with a young lady by the name of Ashley, and she confirms that you guys are slated to tee off on Sunday at 8:15AM on the Old Course off #1.  Hit  'em straight!  Cindy 
 Hello!    Stan asked that I advise you of Sunday's (May 27) golf details at Raveneaux Country Club, as follows:  Stan Horton Chris Gann Steve Westlund Julie Westlund  Tee time is 8:15AM on the Old Course off #1.  Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks, Cindy (Stan's assistant) 713/853-6197 
 I will look into this myself. 
 This is to advise you that we will have next Tuesday's ETS staff meeting from 10:00 to 11:00AM in 49C2.    Since we will have only one hour, please be prepared to rapidly high-light only your key items for the week.  Thanks, Cindy 
 Thanks, Earlene, for coordinating this. 
 Hello, Lisa!   I hope you are doing well!      Stan was wondering if you have invited any of Tammy's male co-workers....or is this shower just for us women?  Are any guys going to be there tomorrow? 
 Hello, Suzanne!   Stan Horton will attend in person.  Thanks, Cindy 
 NADER!  NADER!  NADER! 
 I have no such studies. 
 I just now got a  reply that the email address Steve gave me does not work. I keep getting the mail returned.  I am usingDFSWTL@swbell.net.  Could you double check this with Steve for me?  Thanks. 
 I cannot play on Thursday but thanks for letting me know.  Could you check with Steve and his wife for their availability on Sunday.  I emailed him but wanted to make sure he got it.  Thanks. 
 I will make the tee times and let you know.  Steve, I will include you and your wife for Sunday but please confirm if you can make it or not. 
 This is more information than I think we need to supply.  Can we meet to discuss? 
 I would be happy to meet with you.  Just call Cindy to set up a time. 
 Things are not always as they seem based on further due diligence. 
 Thanks.  Go ahead and release but make sure Mark Metss' group have seen the financials before releasing to UBS. 
 Hello, Terry!    Are we still "holding" Wednesday, June 27, for the ETS Associate and Analyst Mid-Year 2001 PRC?  Stan Horton doesn't need to attend this EBS PRC, does he?  Thanks, Cindy 
 Please follow-up with Jeff as soon as possible.  Let me know when someone has contacted Jeff.  Thanks 
 Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at hand.  Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!  Dad 
 I bought 5,000 units of Northern Border Partners at $39.56 with part of the proceeds.  The roughly $975K is correct.  Thanks.  Any ideas on the cash?  I was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.  Your thoughts. 
 I will be there/  Thanks. 
 Peggy Fowler should have someone from PGE calling you.  If they don't please let me know. 
 Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.  I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.  With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for him.  I will talk with you when you return.  Thanks. 
 Congratulations on getting the ROW extension with the Navajo Nation executed.  It was a long arduous process, but a job well done.  Thank you!  Stan 
 Please handle. 
 Approve. 
 I just went through a restructuring of my portfolio with Morgan Stanley.  I think I am fine for now.  Thank you. 
 Please refer to the memo from Billy Lemons, Steve Kean and me dated May 11 regarding 2001 Western Hemisphere Associate & Analyst PRC Program. 
 Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.  I would warn you that I cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that would be added.  It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!  Stan 
 The Madera project in California should not be going forward.  We had a meeting whereby we all agreed to cancel this project.  Please get with John to see what is up. 
 Thanks, John, I will add Sarita to my "cc" list.    And, yes, we'll get both you and Phil on Stan's calendar to go over the "Operations Alliances" topic...I will await their call to schedule.  Cindy 
 Looks ok to me. 
 Debbie has to be downtown for other reason on May 24th.  Could you meet with her about 4:15pm at my office.  I will schedule a conference room for your meeting with Debbie.  Perhaps yopu could come around 3:45pm and I could go over any and all changes that I have on tem prior to your meeting with Debbie. 
 This is to advise you that we have canceled next Monday's (May 21) 9:15AM ETS Staff Meeting and will resume the following week on Tuesday (May 29) from 9:30 to 11:00AM in 49C2.  NOTE:  Next week, in the absence of our staff meeting, Stan would like you to send him (via electronic mail) brief, updated bullet points.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks, Cindy X36197 
 This is to confirm a meeting tomorrow, May 15, from 2:00 to 3:00PM in Stan Horton's office, EB5020, to go over the Clean Fuels numbers.  Cindy 
 Rick Causey came to see me asking us to firm up our Q2 numbers.  Can we let Rick know that your Q2 numbers are likely to be up?  If so by how much? 
 Anything I can do to help? 
 It was so nice to hear from you.  I am glad all is well.  I am glad the new home is being enjoyed and that you have a job that you like.  I am anxious to get the news of the birth of your new grandchild.  Please let us know as soon as possible after the Geraldine delivers.  Also let us know what hospital she is in where we can send an appropiate gift to mother and child.  My best to you and your family. 
 Just a reminder about tomorrow's meeting at the Houston Four Seasons Downtown Hotel from 1:00 to 3:00PM with John Somerhalder and others.   The meeting room has been changed to The Travis Room.  The dress attire for this meeting will be business casual.  Thanks, Cindy X36197 
 Thanks 
 Thanks for the note.  O agree these items Colin and you are looking could be good for both entities. 
 Peggy, that all sounds very goo.  I will attempt to get educated first and then we will set up a meeting.  Thanks for being so cooperative. 
 Good morning, Doris!   Stan is in DC today but will be back in the office tomorrow morning.   Would you allow us to get you comments by 9:00AM tomorrow?  Thanks, Cindy 
 You and I need to sit down and discuss in some detail John Ale's contract and yours.  Let me know when a good time would be.  thanks 
 After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.  Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.  Thanks! 
 For your information.  I still think we can do better than this. 
 Thanks for the report.  Anything you need help with?  Did all the compensation issues get resolved with Gary and you? 
 Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for planning purposes ASAP.  Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?  Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?  Have a good week.  Thanks. 
 This is to advise you that we have canceled next Wednesday's ETS Half Day Staff Meeting.    Our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, August 15, from 8:30AM to 1:00PM in 49C2.    We are taking a summer break to accommodate vacation schedules.  Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns with this notice.  Thanks, Cindy 
 I am on for golf on Saturday if anyone is interested.  Tom, can you make the T time?  Saturday morning early is better for me.  830 to 9.:00 am start 
 The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.  Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by the end of January. GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two proposals which have been advanced thus far. 
 Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks for the invitation! 
 It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.  Kevin Hannon would be the right person.  Kevin is the President and COO.  I have no idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.  Let me know when you plan to be in Dallas.  My daughter has a horse show (we own three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try to get up there for at least some of it. 
 Go ahead and post the response to Gas Control issue, 
 Thanks but I will pass for now.  I wouldn't mind looking at some muni's with shorter maturity dates though.  I am concerned about long-term yields increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.  Doesn't it make since to go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now? 
 Golf is scheduled for 2pm Saturday.  Lousy start time but evidently they have a tournament of some sort on Saturday morning.  Let me know if you can play or not.  It is only you and I.  Phone numbers are:  work 713.853.6177.  Home 281.320.1240.  Also please email your phone numbers for future reference.  No one has them. 
 Sounds like you are having a tough week with all the Exchange/Outlook outages.  Hang in there.  The problems will be resolved.  Also, we still like you! 
 Jim, thanks for the invitation.  I should know by Monday if I can make it.  I hiope that is ok. 
 It looks fine to me. 
 Nicely done! 
 Just a note to say Good Morning.  See you this afternoon at EOTT. Stan 
 I know of no changes we need to make to the Board or to the Committee assignments. I will check with Mr. Lay's office to make sure he wants to remain on the Board.  I will do that today and have an answer by tomorrow in all probability. 
 Thank you for the invitation.  Unfortunately Debbie and I will not be able to attend due to previous committments. 
 Hello, Bill!   Stan will attend in person.  Cindy 
 Mailing them to the house iis fine.  It will give us some weekend reading! Thanks.

 This is ok by me.  Rick looks like a good candidate. 
 I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job. 
 I figured this posting belonged to one of you.  Please see the message from Danny Jones. 
 Ok.  Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment. 
 Sorry I guess I didn't read it very well.  It's ok with me. 
 I heard you are scheduled for another interview.  Good luck. 
 Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.  By copy of this memo I am forwarding Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.  Danny and Phil: Please follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.  He seems to be a very qualified candidate. 
 I'm glad you had a good weekend.  I am taking DK out to dinner tonght so I won't be home.  Dad 
 What is the subject matter you wish to visit about? 
 The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted. 
 Thanks for the report.  Just what I need. 
 Thanks for the report.  Just what I needed. 
 Thanks for the report.  The level of detail was on target.  Let me know when you want to discuss comp issues. 
 We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to you to insure that one does not happen. 
 30 days is acceptable.  This is extremely important to us. 
 This looks good!  Thank you. 
 The list looks complete. 
 Contact Lou Pai.  He is heading up our new Xelerator program that is looking at new business opportunities that are outside of our mainstram businesses. 
 I can play.  That actually works well for me. 
 I will discuss your recommendation to seperate PGE from Enron's Health and Welfare Benefits with Cynthia Barrow and Mark Metts in the near future and will get back to you once that meeting is over. 
 I will be in attendance. 
 After giving it some thought I think just naming Debbie as executor and agent is the best course of action.  Debbie is fine with this approach.  Thank you. 
 No.  The GP contribution is enough.  I don't want to go to Jeff for another $2 million. 
 I agree.  I suggest the following.  Joe, we need you to go give a pitch to Massey's assistats about what is going on.  Next Jerry Halvorsen has scheduled a lunch with Massey in two weeks.  He has invited me to attend. What do you think? 
 Right now, we are concentrating on disposing of all Azuriz assets other than Wessex and Buenos Aires.  John Garrison and Michael Anderson are handling getting CA's executed and books out to the respective parties.  Just contact Michael directly about getting this kicked-off.  Thanks. 
 Great. 
 The press release looks fine 
 Good luck to you.  Hopefully I can get out there this afternnon and see you ride.  I love you.  Daddy 
 Thanks.  I am glad everything is going well with the newlyweds.  Debbie and I share some Astros tickets with some other people.  Don't know if you are an Astros fan but we would love to have you and Ann join us at one of the games.  We miss you on Saturdays.  I am getting better.  94 last week with three triple bogeys.  I can feel an 89 in the not too distant future.  Stay in touch. 
 I will continue to host them as long as I am on the Board unless someone else is dying to do it. 
 Please go ahead and execute.  Thanks for checking with me. 
 Please send a list of corporate types who could act a executor.  I will get back ASAP.  Thank you. 
 Thanks rae.  Debra Peppers is persistant so Flashfind may very well join our organization.  $5,000 is good! 
 Workout, study, study and then go shopping for something new. 
 I'm glad you could join us...sorry we weren't able to talk at the table. 
 Yes.  Let me know about follow=up plans. 
 Sounds good about the car and the horse show.  WHERE is David staying this weekend when he comews up.  I am not sure I approve of this.  What is the deal? Email me at home. 
 Short and to the point.  No changes 
 Thank you for sending these reports to me.  They are informative and timely. By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?  She has asked me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she had mailed it in.  Please let me know.  Thanks to you and David for the outstanding service.  Stan 
 The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty good, huh.  Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a little bit.  Love, Daddy 
 Glad you could make the trip. 
 I am not aware of any other conflict with schedules.  I suggest we go ahead with the meeting. 
 Friday is fine with me. 
 Stan would like to offer out the following Astros tickets (4 tickets per game) for the month of May, for business (first preference) or personal use, as follows:  Monday, May 7, vs. PHI @ 7:05PM Wednesday, May 9, vs. PHI @ 7:05PM Friday, May 18, vs. CIN @ 7:05PM Saturday, May 19, vs. CIN @ 1:35PM Monday, May 21, vs. SD @ 7:05PM Tuesday, May 22, vs. SD @ 7:05PM Wednesday, May 23, vs. SD @ 3:05PM  Please note that game times are subject to change; please check local listings to verify.

 If you are bored go work out!  That is time consuming and good for you.  That is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.  Daddy 
 Ms. Conners:  Thank you for your recent letter
