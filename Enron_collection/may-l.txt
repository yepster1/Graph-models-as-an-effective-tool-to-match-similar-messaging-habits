 This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.  In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes.  If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.  Thank You,  Larry May

 Please enable Flecther Sturm to sell options 
 As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules.  Thanks,  Larry 
 I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.  Thanks Larry

 Dr.Lockwood,  Due to a family crisis concerning my son's health I am requesting an extension on completing the mid-term exam for IN520 until  11/7/01.  I realize the deadline had already passed but between work and my son's condition I was delayed in sending this e-mail.  I appreciate any help you can provide in this extension.

 Hi Dr. Leerburger,  Thanks for your feedback.  I know how busy you must be - I have three kids (7,5 and 2) so I realize how precious time off is.  I applyed to DIA, NSA and CIA about three weeks ago.  I got letters back stating my application had been recieved.  The DIA said I have been put into their applicant pool.  My company (Enron) has offered me a position in London managing a trading desk for crude oil and refined products.  They want me to move over in January or Febuary, so hopefully I'll know something before then.  If I'm not offered anything by then, I'll probably go and plan on applying to Georgetown in one to two years.  I really hope I'm offered a position now - London would be interesting - but with everything that is going on now, I'd rather start this new career now.  Thanks again for your feedback and I hope to speak with you when time permits.  If you are teaching the Threat Assesment course at AMU Spring 2002, I'll probably be in your class.  Sincerely,  Larry May 
 Thanks Tara 
 THANK YOU 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for staying in touch.  Fell free to use me as a reference.  Give me = a call : 713 853-6731.  Good luck.  Larry 
 Dear Dr. Leerburger,  Thank you for your response.  As I wrote in my earlier note, I am seeking a career change into intelligence analysis. My work the last eleven years probably has a similar skill set - I basically process a great deal of information each day in order to arrive at decisions positioning a large commodity portfolio for my company.  As you may see from my resume and cover letter, I also have several years of military experience in the Navy's aviation and intelligence communities  Given the serious nature of this career change, I wish to speak to someone currently working in this field (I read your biography on the AMU website ).  My questions include:  - Do you find the work to be rewarding?  What are the attractions and frustrations of the work? - Does my current background make me an attractive candida
