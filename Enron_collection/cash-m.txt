 Possible contract candidate. 
 please respond.  MHC 
 Lance,  Kim was here on Friday.  I have asked Mark Taylor for his thoughts.  Michelle 
 Will do.  I've asked Diane to send you the legal advice we received.  I've finalized the template today, and should have a draft out tomorrow (Monday).  Michelle 
 No, this is not.  I am curious as to how this got to you.  I will give it a review and get back with you. 
 Freudian slip, I'm sure.  See you tomorrow!  Michelle 
  FYI -- see what you can find out about this -- perfect opportunity to market OLER's services.  Thanks  MHC 
 Fran, would you mind pulling the data for GSP on this.  It is strange that we should be paying unemployment rates for GSP, since it is its own entity, separate and apart from Enron.  Do you know anything about the other transactions? 
 Sure, sounds like a good plan to put the flag in Personic to discuss the time limitations.  Other than the specific gas-related folks, I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees.  I'll double check to confirm, though.  MHC 
 Alan,  I understand that you have approved the request below.  Is this because they are WRA personnel?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, with apologies if I already sent this to ya'll. 
 please print this plus all attachments.  MHC 
 The consent form should be kept in PH file.   The background check results should be maintained separately.  MHC 
 Not a problem if the employee does not date it.  The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company.  MHC 
 Kathy, we should go ahead and remove these people.  They are employed by WRA, which is in a transition process on a confidential matter.  Please remove them.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Looks fine with me. 
 Twanda, please handle.  MHC 
 I've sent this to litigation unit.  MHC 
 Cathy,  I have been getting this question a lot!  It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect.  Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.  Michelle 
 I believe that these involve issues of intellectual property and thus are more appropriately decided by you.  In principle, I have no issue with Enron indemnifying Accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership.  On the logo issue, I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks.  Michelle 
 who knows.  I can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees.  Michelle 
 so, would we have an issue? 
 Thanks for the resume.  This person's background won't work for us -- we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here, particularly M&A, major real estate, financing, etc.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Please arrange as many of these as you can.  Michelle 
 this looks fine with me.  Michelle 
 Please save as a MHC document -- I think that some of this will be used for powerpoint for Nepco trip next week.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Mike,  Would you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the NEPCO charge?  I would like to obtain information from him and be "in the loop" on all legal matters involving NEPCO's employment practices issues.  Thanks a lot.  I am looking forward to visiting with you in person next week.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please print this for me - -I've been having problems when I try to print.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, what do you think of this?  I view it as problemmatic because I believe the grant agreements and the stock plan should govern.  Your comments and suggested revisions would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Sharon, I suggest that we ask Valeria Hope to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly.  What do you think?  Michelle 
 sounds great!  I've asked Twanda to set something up.  MHC 
 Valeria is looking into it.  Michelle 
 FYI -- He tried to call me today, but missed me.  I have returned his call and left a voice mail for him.  I'll let you know if we have a chance to visit.  Michelle 
 Thanks, but we got it from the vault late yesterday.  Michelle 
 Thanks.  I'll do an assignment letter formalizing the relationship.  Michelle 
 FYI, it looks like you are on the way to approval.  Until that time, if you have any excess capacity in terms of time, get with Valeria on HR Employee Relations efforts.  Thanks.  MHC 
 These changes look fine to me for employees working in Japan.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 FYI, these should be in our form files for Japan -- this is the new Form B for Japan.  Michelle 
 Shanna, Botchlett is not interested in mediating at this time.  He wants to go for the jugular, I guess.  MHC 
 Hi, all.  On the budget for HR Risk Management (formerly OLER), Cindy told me to keep things flat for next year.  I would appreciate seeing the numbers for budget projections and actuals for the group year to date, though.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Dan, Wayne Perry has issues with the consulting agreement I drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past.  Do you want to pick it up?  By copy of this, I am asking Twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him.  Michelle 
 I'll be there!  Do we have a meeting with Shankman for tomorrow? 
 Teresa,  The employment lawyer at Littler, Mendelson is named Kerry Notestine.  He is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements.  I also will have emailed him my summary of the Bob Henderson agreement, so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena.  His number, in case you need an immediate response while I am at NEPCO next week, is 713-652-4748.  Michelle 
 yes, we still own the IP. 
 Hi, David!  I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.  I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in Houston.  Specifically, an employee named Jason Davis claims that he was fired from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.  Have you heard of this?  How would you like to handle it?  We can discuss in more detail on Thursday.  Michelle 
 Pat, would you please give this a look and provide comments?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Diane, would you please send Valeria the recent (positive) article on PRC?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pat, I think this isolates the employment-related comments for the Brooklyn Navy Yard transaction.  Your comments would be appreciated.  Thanks.  MHC 
 I don't know if you heard, but Kim and I spoke with him, and he is ok with everything.  I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to Kim and me for review and placement in the file.  Thanks! 
 sounds good to me. 
 Cameron sleeps in a real bed, but would be happy on the floor as well.  No more cribs, yea!!  Great news about the tix.  We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats -- if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door, that works for us.  We are so excited!! 
 will do 
 No, I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical!  I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman. 
 I'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.  Can that be rectified, or is that beyond your role? 
 Sarah,  At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.  Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement. 
 I have not.  I'll send a follow-up email today. 
 Absolutely!  I agree that it would be great for you. 
 I know we had some sensitivity in the past; let me check on it and get back with you.  mhc 
 Rick, I believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts -- almost everyone has emailed me with that information already, pursuant to my prior request.  I'll forward those to you for your information.  I would like to institute some limitations on training for the group, due to costs and out-of-office considerations, but I have not finalized those recommendations yet.  Stay tuned!  MHC 
 Pat, I am keeping you busy these days.  Any comments on below?  Michelle 
 Neither did I.  I just got the comments yesterday.  I'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments.  Michelle 
 I'm handling the afternoon -- I think that Harry has this morning.  MHC 
 I got this.  I assume this is 12:30 Central Time? 
 Here is the overview of Bob Henderson's Employment Agreement. 
 What do you think?  MHC 
 Please send David Lund copies of our standard corporate services agreement and the standard assignment letter (use Bridgeline example -- with and without non-compete).  Michelle 
 We're formatting one this week, and we'll send it when it's done.  Michelle 
 I agree also, but I don't know all the parties or complications involved.  Should there be a (groan) meeting on this? 
 Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Shanna, I spoke with Per tonight about this.  Let's talk tomorrow.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Let's discuss exactly what is involved here -- confidentiality, etc.  Thanks.  MHC 
 please print all these for me.  Thanks.  MHC 
 FYI re:  NEPCO picketing issues.  Michelle 
 generally, we just go by the terms in the agreement and attach a brief position description. 
 I assume this has been calendared? 
 Let's meet with her and anyone else she would like to have attend.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Mark, I understand that this is a copy of the latest agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting.  I agree that a new master would be a good idea.  Michelle 
 Misha, I haven't yet received the details about the lunch on the 28th.  I'm out on vacation the end of next week, so I wanted to try to fill it early next week.  Could you forward me the invitation or details?  Thanks.  MHC 
 Thanks, Misha.  How many are at a table?  I've already got some folks who are interested.  Michelle 
 In my dealings with Accenture, they have acted as if this is the agreement that governs them.  I don't know which Accenture group is involved, however.  Either way, I believe that it is time for an updated agreement, with better rates.  Have you been working with Global Strategic Sourcing on this? 
 I'll get it set up.  Michelle 
 Indeed I will.  MHC 
 David,  Derrick approved the use of Charlie Caulkin.  Also, here is info on the Denver lawyer who should review the issues relating to the sharing of employees.  Do you want to call him, or would you like me to?  Good to see you this week.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  NEPCO picketing issues. 
 Frank,  I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week.  During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday.  I haven't seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today.  Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn't heard of that if you were.  Would you please let me know the status?  Thanks a lot!  Michelle 
 Twanda is out today and Monday; I'll do the best I can. 
 Please save these to a MHC document -- I've got edits.  Thanks.  MHC 
 Dear Grandmother,  So sorry we didn't make it  yesterday.  We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart  -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.  Oops!!!  He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn't hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok.  So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.  Hope all is well with you. 
 Ryan, I think we should have some draft answers for these -- get with the MAD team to see what kinds of answers we have given in the past on these types of questions.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for  the good words.  I appreciate your input.  Michelle 
 Valeria,  FYI -- here are kudos from one of your clients!  Keep up the good work!  Michelle 
 Not that I know of.  Michelle 
 I don't know.  I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters.  Sorry I am so clueless.  MHC 
 FYI.  Michelle 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 please make changes. 
 Diane, there are lots of emails about this topic.  Would you please print them and collect them in a file labelled for Tobias?  Thanks.  MHC 
 I don't know -- I think we've categorized them as severance, but maybe we should get with Mackin.  MHC 
 Diane, I've left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please follow up, as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call.  Basically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we want to dissolve it.  Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Donna, I think this falls in your court.  Let me know if it should be handled elsewhere.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 please calendar -- I'd like to go. =20 
 Let's discuss when we both can talk.  MHC 
 Here is the first part of Kerry's email.  MHC 
 Rick, would you mind getting on the transition of HRRM functions to the staffing and service center groups?  I think that you have the most familiarity with the processes and perhaps could facilitate that taking place next week.  Let's discuss.  Michelle 
 The contents of this email are privileged and confidential.  Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.  IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to "salt" jobs down there in Florida.  The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.  Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.  We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.  There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.  Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.  Back to Mark's suggestions:  Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., "Are you hiring electricians out there?"  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.  Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.  Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.  One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.  David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally. 
 I've received advice from Vinson & Elkins on this, which I will send your way.  It looks like we can.  MHC 
 Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?  Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.  The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco.  How does that impact the question below?  Thanks!  Michelle 
 You are invited to sit at the Enron table for the Father of the Year luncheon on August 28 at 11:45 at the Hyatt Regency.   This event is a delightful one, where there are tributes paid to several "outstanding" fathers in the community.  Please let me know if you would be able to attend. 
 Pat, I hope you are feeling well.  Kidney stones sound painful!!  Take care of yourself.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please pull all emails on this subject matter out of my in box and print for the file.  Thanks.  MHC 
 No.  I believe that the answer will be to destroy the materials, but I am double-checking the research on that this afternoon.  Thanks.  MHC 
 April 20 
 FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company.  It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.  I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.  I would like to talk about how to manage that.  Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 So, my question goes to the highest bidder . . . 
 Please note that we do not agree with the terms of the letter attached to the resume.  We have provided a contract for review by your company, and that agreement should govern.  With that, thanks for the resume.  Michelle Cash 
 Of course -- I was just giving you grief! 
 hard to offend me 
 please print these for me.  Thanks.  mhc 
 Thanks!! 
 FYI.  I've left him a message that it is "no problem" in this instance.  But, I know that you were interested in having it reviewed before it went out, so I wanted to let you know what was happening.  MHC 
 Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser's attorney.  He basically wants a year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).  I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand.  Let me know if you want to know the details.  I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.  In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.  Michelle 
 I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.  We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.  In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.  Michelle 
 Amy, at your convenience, please give me a call about Walter Coffer's review.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Michelle Cash Assistant General Counsel Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department 713-853-6401 Ass't:  Twanda Sweet -- 713-853-9402 
 Tara,  Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.  Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.  So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.  Call me with any questions.  Michelle 
 What do you mean by backdating?  I think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing. 
 Valeria.  Thanks for handling this one.  Please keekp me posted.  Michelle 
 John, how do you want to handle this?  Michelle 
 please print these and file -- AMPS.  Thanks. MHC

 Hi, Felicia.  As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.  I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.  As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.  So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.  I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.  The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.  I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.  Let me know if you have questions.  Michelle  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3823 Houston, Texas  77002 (713) 853-6401 michelle.cash@enron.com  This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges. 
 Gina/David, I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions.  My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation.  Presumably, if they have a Click at Home PC, they can do it from there.  If not, we should be able to facilitate it manually.

 Rick,  Nice kudos from Robert.  Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.  As you may recall, she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists.  They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doing is essential.  Thanks.  Michelle

 Hi, Janel,  I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.  In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.  Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.  I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.  Thanks.

 Diane, would you please track this down and let Cathy know that we'll respond asap when I return.  Or, you could have Kriste respond.  I do not remember seeing a letter from counsel, but it is possible that it fell through the cracks.  Thanks.

 Please note and put in a file for me regarding Enron AAPs.  That obviously will be of significance to me in my new role.  Thanks.

 As described in my prior email, here is a list of Ludwin's transactions.  Let me know if you have any interest.

 Kerry,  We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.  I hope all is ok, and that you didn't have too  much damage.  Bellaire was hit pretty hard.  On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?  Twanda can connect you.  I'll be on vacation this week and will return the 18th.  Thanks.

 Diane, not a high priority, but would you please get with Kim Melodick and find out what the client group wants to do with the Alonzo Williams lawsuit?  He never answered, and currently is in default.  Thanks.

 Bummer about the flood insurance.  Of course, we had it and didn't need it.  We also pulled up our rugs, moved furniture, etc.  Had we not, the house surely would have flooded.  Talk to you next week.

 Yes, I should be involved.  Have you sent Noel prior information? 
 FYI, I forgot to forward this to you earlier.  MHC 
 That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.  We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.  Michelle 
 Would you please send Rob Cole here at Enron a copy of our letter to EEOC for April?  He doesn't need any of the attachments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, would you please print?  Thanks.  MHC 
 for my forms files.  thanks. mhc 
 Why does this person need Expertfinder?  I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails.  If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him?  More information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Would you please send Janice Priddy the blank short form?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, will you please handle this?  Add the inserts for the various items.  Michelle 
 I think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because our annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.  Also, we usually use some other language.  I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter.  Michelle 
 No, it should remain the top 25 percent, because it is the top percentage of the criteria, not the peer group.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Do you know this person? 
 please print this plus attachment and file under Corporate American Express Cards.  thanks 
 please send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement -- ok to send it by email. thanks 
 Mark,  Attached is a signed version of the Consulting Services Agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).  Yevgeny Frolov in HR is working on a project whereby Accenture is developing software for Enron.  Enron will own the content of the programs, and ultimately, licenses will be sold for the software, with Enron and Accenture sharing the royalty interest.  I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement.  I will send you a copy of the latest term letter, along with my handwritten comments on the draft.  Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these?  Yevgeny will contact you directly.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Pursuant to my prior email, here is the draft term letter.  I will forward my handwritten comments.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Ava, would you please forward this to the IP lawyer who is handling Mark's stuff while he's out?  Thanks.  MHC 
 Ava, would you please forward this to the IP lawyer who is handling Mark's work?  We are looking for a quick turnaround, so if you could ask him to call me asap, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Thanks for the info, Karen.  Go ahead and keep this in your file regarding Meliza, so that it can be there in the event we need it further.  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please note.  MHC 
 Will do, once I receive the revised agreement from them.  Michelle 
 I spoke with her and got this information.  We are scheduling her to come in and meet with Mark Taylor, Cheryl Nelson, and others who have information about the position.  Molly, when is that interview scheduled?  Michelle 
 why don't we wait and share our revised policies with them? 
 Please print this plus attachment and file Corporate American Express Cards.  thanks 
 Alan, do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town?  Michelle 
 Would you please find a copy of this and send to Felicia?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I think this is in your ballpark, not mine! 
 I am happy to assist, although I think that this is Kriste's world.  I've passed this email on to her, and will assume that she has it covered, unless I hear otherwise.  Michelle 
 Thanks, Pat.  It is only temporary (at least, that's what I keep insisting!).  I just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in Wyoming or Montana (I can't remember now).  Data room to be opened in Denver on Monday.  I'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along.  Would you be available?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 Looks good to me. 
 Who will get them?  I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect the privilege.  Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is no protection if we find undesirable results. 
 Hello, all.  Attached is an invitation from Seyfarth Shaw to attend their labor and employment seminar.  It is scheduled for Tuesday, 7/17, and lasts only a half-day.  Generally, their seminars are high quality.  Plus, the cost is only $50.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  Michelle 
 I don't think that is a good idea. 
 I like that better.  When is that meeting?  Or, do we want to do that separately outside of the PRC evaluation meeting? 
 please print this and file Corporate American Express Cards. Thanks. 
 I'd check with Oxley first.  I kind of think they are separate issues, and I am not sure that the whole group needs to see the areas where we may have issues.  MHC 
 absolutely, unless Kerry plans to be nice to him 
 I can't attend, as I'll be out of the office in Austin at a mediation.  Michelle 
 Twanda, please send them hard copies of the invitation for Seyfarth's seminar.  Thanks.  MHC 
  How are we answering this type of question? 
 Oops -- too efficient. 
 please put in Curran's files. 
 I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter? 
 yes, it is redundant. 
 No, but we have been meeting on this topic.  We met early this week and are having a follow-up meeting next week.  I will ask Diane Goode to include you by phone, if you want to attend.  Michelle 
 We're meeting now, near my office -- can you come? 
 They are done and should be in your email today.  MHC 
 Congratulations!!!!  I know you are happy to have that wrapped up.  Michelle 
 great -- let me know your feedback. 
 Also, say hi to Ted Meyer, who is my (and your) Bellaire neighbor. 
 I think this works.  What is the best way to incorporate this into the plan? 
 I'm holding off on these until I get the package from PR. 
 My info is correct.  Michelle 
 yes, indeed.. 
 What do you think?  We have a babysitter that night already, although I am sure we could cancel it. 
 Please schedule me to attend this meeting.  Thanks.  MHC 
 George,  I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts.  She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from Eric Connor.  Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.  I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Michelle 
 Terrie, On the issue of communicating the restated severance plan, below is the recommendation of four different attorneys who have considered the issue.  Michelle 
 No rush on this -- late this week is fine.  Michelle 
 Would you please handle this?  Thanks.  Michelle 
 I'll get back with you asap.  Michelle 
 FYI re:  offer revocation.  Michelle 
 Money. 
 The good news is, we don't owe a mediation fee, right?  Lizzette, I'll give Jack a call.  Michelle 
 I guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like.  Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.  Michelle 
 I will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all Enron entities domestically.  Similarly, some Enron-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, etc.  So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications.  I suggest getting with Rick Johnson on that issue.  Michelle 
 Ann, I've looked over this list and realized I have no relevant information, so I've forwarded it to Sharon and Kriste, who should be able to help you.  Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.  Michelle 
 Mike,  I have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims.  I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.  I will send you a new waiver form to use.    The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA.  Michelle 
 I agree that it is best to leave alone. 
 Yes. Send to me. Thanks. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 It shiuld be cynthia barow instead. I think the benefits info already is in what we sent to katie caplan at weil. Let me know how I can help. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Go ahead and notify. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)

 I don't think we should curtail cause terminations.  Others would probably be best to wait unless there is a disruptive situation.  Michelle 
 You should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  We do have a plan in place, but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan  in the last few weeks.  So, we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now.  Michelle 
 We need the following data asap:  1.  Number of total employees at all Enron entities broke
