 Bill,  Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.  Craig Dean 
 Hey Paul.  Just thought I write and see if you found out more about the snowboard, and if you are sure that you do not want anything for it?   I really appreciate it,  Geir 
 GOOD ARTICLE 
 I HAVE SOME POWER WHAT IS YOUR BID? 
 THERE WERE SOME ISO CUTS AND ISSUES YESTERDAY:  HE19: EPMI_CISO_DUCKS @MALIN. CUT THE SCHEDULE FROM 219MW TO 169MW.  HE23: FLOWED 75MW FROM MALIN TO PALO VERDE. THERE ARE NO FINALS FOR THIS SCHEDULE. THE REASON WAS THAT WE WERE FIRST AWARDED 75MW CONG RELIEF. THEY THEN REPOSTED FINALS WITHOUT TELLING US. WE FOUND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR THAT THE 75MW SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE. INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE SCHEDULE AND PISSING OFF EVERYBODY I HAD BARRY AT THE ISO PUT IN THE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT GETTING CONG RELIEF BUT THE SCHEDULE DID FLOW.  GEIR 
 I WILL PICK 24.25
