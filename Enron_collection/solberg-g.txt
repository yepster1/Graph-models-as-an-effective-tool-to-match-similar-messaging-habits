 Bill,  Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.  Craig Dean 
 Hey Paul.  Just thought I write and see if you found out more about the snowboard, and if you are sure that you do not want anything for it?   I really appreciate it,  Geir 
 GOOD ARTICLE 
 I HAVE SOME POWER WHAT IS YOUR BID? 
 THERE WERE SOME ISO CUTS AND ISSUES YESTERDAY:  HE19: EPMI_CISO_DUCKS @MALIN. CUT THE SCHEDULE FROM 219MW TO 169MW.  HE23: FLOWED 75MW FROM MALIN TO PALO VERDE. THERE ARE NO FINALS FOR THIS SCHEDULE. THE REASON WAS THAT WE WERE FIRST AWARDED 75MW CONG RELIEF. THEY THEN REPOSTED FINALS WITHOUT TELLING US. WE FOUND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR THAT THE 75MW SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE. INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE SCHEDULE AND PISSING OFF EVERYBODY I HAD BARRY AT THE ISO PUT IN THE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT GETTING CONG RELIEF BUT THE SCHEDULE DID FLOW.  GEIR 
 I WILL PICK 24.25

 Roger called to inform us that they will be doing a 5MW payback HE7 on.  It will come in the scrape as a firm schedule and there will be no schedule in the model.  Check tags EPE1152 and EPE1153 for more information.  Thanks, -John Anderson 
  For Monday -  STNW is 35 mw short off peak @ Mid-Columbia.  Please cover these positions under the STWHOURLY book and enter an inter-desk swap with STNW to reconcile. Contact Bill, Sean, or me if you have any questions whatsoever about how to handle this.  Thanks, Kate 
 Hey..  The ISO forced balanced our PORTFOLIO for SUNDAY. They shifted EES load from SP15 to NP15 with Congestion and paid a lot of Congestion in the process. The Amounts are in The PGE3 LOAD zone under EES2. The amounts are as following.  HE8	8 HE10 	5 HE14	46 HE15	40 HE16	40 HE17	44 HE18	40 HE19	24  Could you please make sure to charge EES with the congestion charges and not RT.  Thanks. Geir 
 HEY KATE. COULD YOU PLEASE INCLUDE THE PRICES IN THESE EMAILS.  GEIR

 Hey Cara  BPA called me yesterday inquiring about tag 26486. They did not think the PSE was right from BIGEDDY/NOB. It says BPA, they claim it is ENRON. They told me to notify my pre-scheduleder on Monday so this could be straightened out.  Geir

 Hey Guys.  The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels.  Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.  Geir 
 Hey Guys!  I went through all the templates and removed the RT prefix for all the templates. You can now sort them alphabetically making the process of finding the right template a lot easier. From now on please do no use the RT prefix when creating new templates.  Geir 
 I HAD TO BUY THE TRANSMISSION FROM PAC TO BC BORDER TO MAKE SURE THE SCHEDULE FLOWED. THE DEAL# IS 650664. PLEASE FIGURE OUT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR THIS WHEEL AND BILL THEM.  GEIR
