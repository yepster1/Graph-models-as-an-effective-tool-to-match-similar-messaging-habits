 I had received this in an e-mail, wasn't sure if you had gotten a copy.  Stacey 
 This the latest on the move.  Stacey 
 That's it for me.  Stacey 
 FYI  Stacey 
   Here you go.  Stacey 
 Can you tell me what the post-id was on my original file?  Stacey 
 thanks 
 Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to Jeff, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  Andrea, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.  Stacey 
 What is she talking about?  Stacey 
  Thought you would think this was funny.  Stacey 
 Was in a meeting with UBS at this time.  Sorry.  Stacey 
 Can you have someone do this?  I forgot to put it on the group's To Do list for the week.  (Besides, I thought I would do it myself, but never seem to find time).  Stacey 
 Does anyone know what the status of this change is for the West?  Stacey 
 Whenever we asked to give terminated information for the Estate we should include the 'Alberta ENA Bankruptcy' portfolio.  The transactions in this portfolio are transactions entered into by Canada using a ENA contract that has now been terminated.  If you have specific questions, please contact Kathy Reeves.  Stacey 
 Leslie,  Here is the most updated list of pre-bankruptcy payouts.  Do you think Evelyn, Bryce, etc. could put together numbers for outstanding payable/receivable?  Stacey 
 You just let me know what y'all decide. 
 Thanks! 
 If you have not already done so, please send instructions to users (or IT support) to update machines in Portland.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I didn't hear much more than that myself.  Stacey 
 I heard that.  How was the floor meeting?  Stacey 
 Steven Luong and Nick are working on a better list with more specific names.  I'll keep you informed.  Stacey 
 Jeremy,  We will need no additional curves.  Only those designated by the gas group will need to be moved.  Thanks for the heads-up.  Stacey 
 What is the exact name for Georgia Pacific?  We do not see any transactions with them in the system.  Stacey 
 Casey,  Can you please auto-schedule the following deals for December.  Please let Leslie and I know when you are complete.  Stacey  Deal # 114998 578961 578964 578965 
 John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet?  I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday, so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify.  We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong, I guess.  Leslie - thoughts?  Stacey 
 Sonia,  Kim may have some changes to the seating assignments.  I believe these changes will also affect where Evelyn's settlements group sits.  Please coordinate changes and then send me a list of desk #'s and associated names.  I need to forward this information to Lloyd Will.  Thanks, Stacey 
 The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?  Stacey 
 Thanks 
 Are the numbers in Canadian $'s?  If so, can you send me conversions.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I have to run, but call me tomorrow.  I have an idea of what your difference might be caused from.  Stacey 
 Please start the following task in the morning:  Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk: Constellation Energy Authority Sempra Energy Trading Public Service of Colorado  I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet.  This is just an update of my initial review.  Any comments would be appreciated.  I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today.  After tomorrow's updates, I will do these.  We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow.  If anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified, please let me know as soon as possible  Thanks,  Stacey 
 I have an 11:00, so I will have to leave early.  Stacey 
 Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.  Stacey 
 As soon as we finish calcing our book on Friday, we should be good to go.  We will start as soon as possible. 
 When: Thursday, January 10, 2002 4:30 PM-5:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: ECS05102  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* 
 Do you know if the rest of these auto-terminations apply to all deals we have with this counterparties, or just certain deals?  Please look into them and let me know as soon as possible.  Stacey 
   Let me know if you need anything else.  Stacey 
 Please don't forget to send this to us so we will have a record.  Stacey

 When: Thursday, January 10, 2002 2:30 PM-3:30 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: Sonia can you set up on 5 in new building  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Sonia,  It looks like you have a meeting from 2-4, so can you send me any documentation that you may have done re: any seating arrangements in the new building.  Thanks, Stacey 
 We are through the 'As of 1-7' tabs.    Stacey 
 Don,  Could you have someone send me the newest list of counterparties (both East & West) that we are still performing with.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Sally,  John Postlethwaite, Donnie Vinson and Casey Evans all have the title of Associate Director.  Kathy Reeves was a manager previously so I assume she is also an Associate Director.  I will be out of the office the rest of this afternoon for a doctor's appointment.  If you need me I will have my cell phone 281-382-5215.  Thanks, Stacey 
 The users I would start with are:  Todd Warwick Frank Cernosek  Stacey 
 Tim,  John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.  In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Do you need any help?  Stacey 
 Thanks - Merry Christmas! 
 This is possible.  Probably won't be until tomorrow.  Stacey 
 Just make sure this is OK.  Stacey 
 The e-mail was sent on 1/3/2002, but the detail states that "TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in the agreement between TXU and EPMI".  The e-mail does not give any details on ENA, ECC, of EES.  Stacey 
 Please send a power and gas book request for Andy Zipper.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I have two other meetings at this time.  Stacey 
 After talking to Tom I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.  I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.  Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Here is the latest results from our valuation engine.  Please let me know if you see any mistakes.  We will update with your newest changes tomorrow, so you can exclude those from your evaluation.  I also noticed that their is a financial UI transaction.  I believe this was just an oversite and have asked Casey to look into it.  Thanks, Stacey 
 I have already updated the Physical and Financial Terminated spreadsheets with these updates.  Please have your groups start the split/clean-up scheduling process for the new counterparties.  Stacey 
 This is coming from Kathy Reeves.  Give her a call.  Stacey 
 Why is there still a financial position in the East portfolio for UI?  Stacey 
   Let me know if this is not what you need.  Stacey 
 Casey,  Can you have someone follow up with Hai and Harry and see how all these reports are working?  Stacey 
 Please find attached the Integration Plan for Power Risk Management.  If you need this information consolidated or expanded just let me know.  Thanks, Stacey 
 You can contact Leslie Reeves for this information.  Stacey 
 Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper?  Any other books needed for him?  Will he be allowed to trade all regions?  Thanks, Stacey 
 Looks good - you mention month-end deadlines.  You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L.  Stacey 
 I know of nothing in stage that I use.  I would like to make sure Casey and John both agree with me.  Stacey 
 Casey and John can get back to you on your specific question re: Canada.  However, I wanted to let you know that our DPR will more than likely not be final until Friday.  Hopefully we can get you all reports then.  We have had to leave the DPR open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 12-31 data as clean as possible for the estate.  Stacey 
 Please let me know your thoughts on the following correspondence.  We are in the process of putting together our integration plan and the interest rate curve is one of our biggest stumbling blocks since the interest rate group will not be going to NEWCO.  As you can see, your name has been volunteered and I need to know what all you will need access to in order to get this curve to the Risk Management groups on a timely (preferably 2:00 p.m.) basis.  Thanks, Stacey 
 Wonder if he knows this?  Stacey 
 This looks good.   I originally had a headcount of 11.  If you added one to my headcount, then I agree.  Stacey 
 This is information on the testing you will be performing this afternoon.  Stacey 
 I can meet Tuesday anywhere from 9:00 to 3:00 (the meeting would have to end at 3:00 because I have a Dr's appt.).  Wednesday, I am totally open.  Stacey 
 I am not personally interested in any positions currently.  Thank you, Stacey White 
 Vlad,  Here is the latest book list based on book requests.  The one item I know has not been requested is Andy Zipper as the LT-Option trader.  When we request this and it is complete, we will send you an update.  Stacey 
 Would 10:00 our time work?  Stacey 
 They are rotating one person out a day starting Monday.  We will not be setting up the West books.  I would like to meet with you and Casey Monday morning if possible.  You can still be at home as long as we can call you.  Stacey 
 We have been officializing every day and the information is obviously as good as the curves.  Every other Friday is just as good as any other day.  Stacey 
 I believe two of you is fine.  We have stopped our rotation in the East and will have lots of work to do re: setting up books, continuing with terminations etc.  Until it becomes evident, continue on.  Stacey 
 Go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trad
