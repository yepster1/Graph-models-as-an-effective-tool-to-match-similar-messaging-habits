 At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs. 
 Being revised currently, but lays out the deal: 
 I'll work on them over the weekend. 
 Hi Lee,  Can you confirm that the retention amount for the "old" turbines? I've got $705,200 per.  Thanks,  Kay 
 It would help if you could take a quick look at these few changes.  Kay 
 I don't think so. 
 Maybe Mark doesn't know about Lance's trip. 
 Warren helped a little yesterday, and Theresa has offered to do my expense account.  I'll limp by miserably until your return.  Kay 
 I'm swamped.  I got up at 430 to work this am.  Got here at 7 yesterday so I could go to the game.  Those young uns recover quickly, don't they?  Still missing you,  Kay 
 Not that this is a big deal, but I heard a voice mail from Mark stating that Lance is the DASH guy while Mark is in DC.  Maybe that was deal specific.  Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs.  I am underwater. 
 Kathleen,  John Keffer, Bill Parrish and Andy Schifrin need access to Midway on Deal Bench.  Can you handle this for me?  Thanks,  Kay

 Absolutely. 
 Hi again,  Delta Power will be making revisions to the LLC for tax purposes.  I've given them your email address to include you in the distribution.  Kay 
 Here's the letter agreement I referenced in my other email.  Kay 
 Hi Rhett, I'm working on one of these turbine transfers via the sale of 80% of the equity of the LLC.  I'll forward the operative docs to you right away.  In any event, here's a change the counterparty wants to the tax language in the letter agreement.  Kay 
 Please see the two additions below. 
 Lets at least get the Florida ones done.  Any idea why she didn't go? 
 I thought you were supposed to have your toes in the sand in Florida.  I'll have to check with Kathleen on the details of the documentation for the various development companies.  If there are a couple most active we can put those on the top of the list.  Kay 
 Well, you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters... 
 David,  Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?  I haven't heard the final word.  Kay 
 Hi Wilson,  It would be great if we could talk this week.  I'm under the gun right now, but will you be available on Friday for a chat?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Carolyn,  Please send to the counterparty (subject to further Enron review).  I suggest a conference call with Delta at 100 to discuss where we are.  Kay 
 I had a momentary lapse.  Too many turbines, not enough time! 
 I remember that the longer I played softball, the bigger the women were. When I was in my late 20's and early 30's, I played men's league, and I think they were smaller than the women! 
 Ben called this am and said we can go ahead. 
 How does Wednesday look for a conference call?  Kay 
 I'm ok.  Theresa Zucha has generously offered to help me with my expense account, which I really wasn't comfortable asking Warren to do anyway.  Thanks for asking.  kay 
 New and hopefully improved version, changing confidentiality and the statement in the term sheet on structure.  Kay 
 You may have these for Tex Mex.  John expects to use something similiar on the coal plant, but obviously that is up to you.  Kay 
 This will be yours when you get back - same counterparty as Tex Mex, I think.  I'll finish this and forward you some other docs.  kau 
 As requested, here is the current draft of the Midway LOI.  The counter party has not seen this draft yet, so this is still preliminary.  I'm reviewing the term sheet re toll.     Kay 
 Ok. 
 Hi Lee,  I haven't checked to see if the PS Stabilizers are included.  How does this look?  Kay 
 Opps.  No, I don't have anything yet.  I got a message from Ben 2 hours ago that said to hold off on Montana Power.  Did you hear differentlly? 
 The issue is getting an assignment agreement that GE will sign.  I've requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most recent GE frame assignment transaction.  That should be our starting point.  Kay 
 We are going to hold the limits the same in this contract, and take the extra on the purchase on the replacement equipment.  Kay 
 Hi Chip,  Have you seen anything from Hancock re Delta?  I haven't.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sheila handled FV.  Today was the first day I had seen them. 
 Danetta worked it for the  Fountain Valley project.  How long has she been here?  I didn't know there was anyone other than you. 
 No problem. 
 Hi Billy,  Can you take a look at this since the Hermanator is out?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank. 
 We have a conference call at 200 with Delta.  If you are interested in returning to the deal you are welcome to jump back in. I suspect the letter agreement will be signed sometime this week.  With closing to occur later this month.  It is up to you.  Kay 
 Here's what GE is signing up for this week.    I would like to see their opinion letter.  Kay 
 Anything else for the term sheet?  Feel free to add it and return to me. 
 Hi Danetta,  I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.  I know that you recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain Valley transaction.  I'm happy to serve up those forms to Freshfields if that makes it is easier for you.  My number is 713 345 7566.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Carolyn and/or John, could one or both of you give me a call as soon as  you are available for a conference call with Chris Calger, Steve and me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Units will be 19, 20, 23, 28 (no serial # on 28).  I think the amounts and pricing stays the same. 
 I would think the policy would still be in place, but I don't remember what it is. 
 Good luck! 
 I guess go back to the original contract performance numbers.  The other numbers must be specific to the site for the Las Vegas project.  Kay 
 That sounds really interesting.  Let me see if I can change one appointment to make it work.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I didn't tell them, so the rumor mill must be working. 
 Hi Pete,  Are the performance numbers the same as the original master numbers?  I recall some email traffic on this.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Karen,  Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kent,  I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the attached.  I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy anyway.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I wouldn't call them until after you've taken the flight! 
 FYI and Ken's review (no offense, John). 
 Here's the latest revision of the Delta letter agreement. I'm reviewing it now.  Kay 
 That's my One Pass number.  ckm 
 Wow, you are up early for a man of leisure!  Kay 
 is this your flight?  Have you seen your ticket?  It isn't in my name,  is it? 
 I agree.  They are really taking their time.  It makes me think that they would sign up as is.  What an optimist!  Kay 
 I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it is a deliverable.  The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel.  To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the Pastoria deal.  It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it will smooth over quickly.  More to come.  Kay  PS.  Still no comments from NorthWestern. We need to talk about how scheduling problems Easter weekend if this thing drags on. 
 Comments from Enron Finance. 
 Hi there,  I suggest that we have an Enron only call at 230 central on Sunday, in advance of the  300 call with Delta.  I believe the call in number is 877 232 0064, pass code 25581#.  Kay 
 For your reading pleasure. 
 Enron is trying to buy some GE turbines to use in projects. 
 I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some of the blanks.  I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the purpose of running the comparison.   The notes included are placeholders since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap.  GE is also reviewing Salmon Energy Agreeement version 2.  redline   Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Lee,  Here is the new turbine contract, blacklined against the March 27 version.  I look forward to speaking with you soon.  Kay 
 You might check to see if this looks like the one in the binder.  I believe it is one and the same.  Kay 
 You have excellent sources. 
 We are trying to close with Delta, and they saw a March 20th draft.  Also, I had it  revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc.  So now I have two versions.  Just trying to get it clear.  I've spoken with Lee about revising the contract to pick up the new contract, leaving the "old" turbine in the master agreement, to be included in the LV Co Gen break out contract.  Couldn't be simpler.  Kay 
 I'm an expert at being a rabid fan and excellent arm chair manager.  I keep waiting for the Skipper to call for advice.... 
 I would love to take you up on it, but I'm already lined up to go.  I'll take a raincheck!  Thanks for thinking of me.  Kay 
 I'm on the phone with Mark H. (the big guy) 
 I feel bad.  I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend. 
 I can't open the form, but I'm good for $50.  Is this something Enron can match? 
 I would guess "yes".  I don't know that I like the idea either. 
 I'm on a conference call which I hope will end by then - a deal we are trying to close today.  YIKES!!!!  Kay 
 Larry left me a voice mail.  Would you mind calling him and telling him that I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so I can't call him until after then.  I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!!  XXXXXOOOOOO  CKM 
 I got a form that consultants sign, and I'll compare them.  Kay 
 4. If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with th= e=20 purchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and this= =20 Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of ENA= =01,s=20 receipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any further= =20 liability of either Party to the other hereunder.

 Chris Calger wants the financing CP removed, and we have a call scheduled at 200 to see if we can get to agreement with Delta. 
 Have I written you back yet?  It is such a zoo, I can't remember.  I've started this email 3 times.  I'm going to the Astros game on Thursday in the Diamond seats.  I'll watch for Ric.  Both Neil and I will be there.  I love those seats.  That's where I'm sitting on opening day, also.  I'm sure you will be at a game soon. Remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games?  It is no nice with the roof open. How many games do you have tickets to this year?  They have James Coney Island outside today.  I ate most of two hot dogs.  I bet I'll be sleepy soon.  I brought them back up here, so my office will probably still smell like chili when  you come back.  Guess I'd better get back to work.  Rest up and get well.  Kay 
 Stephen  is trying to set up a conference call at 200 re Delta.  Please advise if this doesn't work for you.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John can clear conflicts. 
 fyi 
 Becky.  I had four days of vacation, March 19, 20, 21, 22.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Most recent version. 
 Just go ahead and turn it, putting in a [Note:] for any missing pieces.  That will make it easy for me to search.  Thanks, and have a good weekend.  Kay 
 Did you mean for your home number to be on the out of office message?  Kay 
 Yes.  How's that for an answer.  I think you want to revise against this version, since this is the latest version Lee has seen, then blackline against the 20th version.  THANKS!!!  Kay 
 Hi again,  I'm going to have some tweaks on the letter agreement, but please go ahead and distribute to Delta for their review.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I don't know why I have trouble with your email address. 
 Hi Pete,  I have a fire drill for you.  This contract needs to between Salmon Energy LLC and GE, with no agency reference.  In other words, a CA Development form.  Any chance of getting this today?  The delivery dates on one of the turbines will be changing, as is the payment schedule.  Also, the designation of one of the turbines will change.  Salmon will be receiving units 19, 20, 23 and 28 (a new one).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Huh? 
 FYI.  Please read. 
 fyi 
 Hi there,  I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in this deal for a little while.  Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks ago.  Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just have to figure out the paper trail.  Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.  Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.  Talk to all soon,  Kay  PS.  Anna Claire Sole arrived at 200am today. 
 Well, things are hopping around work!  Dan and I have barely had time to say hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.  I've got several deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with Stuart and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night tomorrow, so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.  I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.  Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them. They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will have a late night.  You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it.  My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is transferring with me, but I'm not sure.  In short, I don't know what the difference will be.  It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving it too much thought.  Elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar - this one in Newport Beach at the Four Seasons.  I'm liking the sound of it!  I miss you terribly, as does Neil.  Take care and get well quickly.  It isn't the same without you!!!!!  Kay 
 FYI. 
 What do you think of this? 
 Is this for the  turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new replacement equipment?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Excellent observation.=20 
 John,  Note their lawyers are Paul Hastings.  We need to take that into consideration.  Kay 
 Hi Carlos,  Jake called and said he wants to sign up Delta tomorrow (Friday).  I had a conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing forward.  If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues. Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on the structure?  I'll get up to speed on this during the evening, and will take your deal toy when the deal is done.  Kay 
 I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it. 
 You shouldn't have told Ben. 
 No room at the inn for today and probably not tomorrow.  Carlos says he will be here tomorrow unless something happens tonight.  Kay 
 AE,  When you get a minute please send me your favorite option agreement so that I can get it Hermanized.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good.  Does that mean I'll see you there? 
 Per your request. 
 Mitch/John,  Here's the form of LOI I was thinking of using, in draft form.  I don't know how much information we are prepared to fill in on the term sheet.  If we don't have enough to fill in we can always skip the term sheet for now.    Kay 
 I'll nose around here. 
 We need to cancel Michael's appt with Sharon for that Monday.  Also, why don't you try to find at least 2 people to go with you to the Astro's game on Tueday.  I'll come if I can.  ckm 
 I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.  Is there another day? 
 Yes and no.  They were supposed to call at 5am to see if they should come in at 700 (space permitting).  If no space is available, they are to go in at noon.  I'm guessing they went in at 7, since I think he would have called to say they haven't gone in.  Just a guess, though.  He has his computer at home, so I think if he was sitting around he would drop us a note.  Kay 
 You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?  I'm not asking him to do anything on the LOI.  I haven't spoken to him in person.  I'll address it when we connect.  Are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me?  Kay 
 Here's a draft for your review.  We should talk about the generator before this is sent to MPC.    Kay 
 I haven't read this, so I don't know if it is anywhere close to your deal, but here's a bootleg copy of the Frontera agreement, just to give you a sense of some type of starting point.  Kay 
 Well, Ben's POA is executed, it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's for the subs worked out.  Come see me whenever you want. 
 I didn't know there was one. 
 I got this from Carlos from a deal he and Carolyn have worked on.  Note that the language sounds familiar.  Someone must have sent this form to NorthWestern.  I suspect an Enron person.  Kay 
 I agree it is Matt, and  I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at least other turbine K's) before.  His concern will be us getting some amount of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).  Obviously, he might have some other comments as well.  I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe he can access the site?  Kay 
 Fyi 
 If someone can give me the name and address of Montana Power, I can finish the exclusivity agreement today.   Kay 
 I'm not aware of an override agreement with ABB.  ckm 
 Suitable for printing. 
 Ben,  I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we didn't do it with the turbine stuff)  Kay 
 Remember the count down! 
 Michael is off school April 13 and 16.  I have 3 deals which are supposed to close around then, so I'm not optimistic.  If possible, I will take at least one of those days.  On the summer camp, if we use a camp by you, we will probably lose Charlotte for the summer.  Does that matter to you?  Kay 
 Hi Wilson,  Can you open this attachment?  Kay 
 Hi Karen,  Sounds familiar.  I'm sure you checked this, but in some of the GE contracts, the parent guarantee provision is under the purchaser's responsibilities section, near the beginning of the contract.  A strange place for it.  Good luck,  Kay 
 for your information and email folder 
 Whichever is better for Charlotte. 
 much grass 
 Tonight is yoga night.  ckm 
 Thanks for the reply.  I found it on her desk!  Kay 
 attachment contains overview 
 I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants. Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant. This change in focus should make power development deals easier to structure.  I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting with Herman would also be helpful.  Maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him on these new developments.  Kay 
 These are both pending, but just so you know they exist, I'm sending this along.  Once these are signed I'll send you copies.  Kay 
 Are these ok with you? 
 I'm thinking MK may not be email proficient.  Also note WordPerfect documents.  I bet her secretary had to come into the the office on Sunday. 
 Right. 
 Pete,  Please send John Schwartzenburg a copy of the Fountain Valley transformer contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 My recollection is that the original ABB contract was assigned into TurboPark without revisions/restatement/consent, or a break out contract.  I think EECC had the typewriter on the original contract.   I quickly  looked in my TurboPark binders, but didn't immediately find the ABB contract.  There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.  It wasn't approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC post TurboPark.  I wasn't involved in the Fountain Valley transformer contract, but my guess would be that Pete Thompson worked on it.  The footer you described sounds like an AK footer.  Kay 
 I'll leave that up to you.  We can make faces and pass notes if you come over, but I suppose that isn't essential to the transaction. 
 Good morning,  How about 130 today for a conference call with John's new best friend?  ckm 
 Well, let's try someplace else.  What can you think of in walking distance? It is a lunch for a new lawyer in our group.  Kay 
 I was wondering what I was going to do in my spare time! 
 Let's see if I get your address right this time.... 
 Gentlemen,  Attached is a clean version of the LOI.  Originals are being sent to Bob and Marvin by FedX tonight.  Regards,  Kay 
 hours are 7-630, program runs 9-4.  Maybe we should try church there.  I found the receipts.  We should have taken the forms with us to the auction to save time.  Oh well, live and learn.  Pork chops and spinach?  ckm 
 It was operator error.  Do you know the hours of summer camp?  I put a call in to ask, just in case you didn't know.  I kinda like the Methodist angle, and the swimming pool.  He needs more swimming lessons.  Kay 
 Could you re-send that summer camp website address?  The one I got on the page didn't work.  Thanks,  Kay 
 What's your phone number? 
 I thought about you every day, but I figured you'd be better off with peace and quiet.  My dad is doing fine.  He is very relieved to have it over with.  Last week was just nuts.  Are you still in a lot of  pain?  It takes a while to get your strength back, so don't push it.  Your body has a lot of healing to do.  Aren't you glad you used the Torso Track so that you had decent abdominal strength? It is amazing all the things you use those muscles for.  I can't tell you how much I miss you.  Take care, and I'll write if there's any good gossip.  Kay 
 Suz's temporary replacement can't find the Matagorda Fair receipts I left for Suz.  We may been to call to get duplicates. 
 Elizabeth,  I would like to have a flat screen monitor, if possible.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Works for me.  Kay 
 Thank you so much.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the Rangers, and what a great place to see them.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  Carlos has Illinois, so keep him copies please.  Kay 
 Hi Reagan,  Sure.  I'm digging out now.  Kay 
 Hi Bob,  Any info?  Kay 
 John,  Thanks for driving in to the office so you could send these emails.  Don't forget to mail the hard copy.  I appreciate your help.  This deal will need it.  Ciao,  Kay 
 Wonder how much worse it would have been if we had started with a doc that you and I liked. 
 The changes look fine to me.  Kay 
 I'm looking at it now. 
 I haven't heard anything from David or Scott.  Have you heard anything from Marvin or Bob?  Is there a meeting confirmed for Monday?  I'm on another conference call re landfill.  Yikes.  Kay 
 Ben/Chris,  Unless something new comes up, I think we finished the letter agreement.  I'm awaiting a revised draft now, and if it is acceptable to NW, they will sign it and fax it to me tomorrow morning.  Maybe on Ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here from a schedule standpoint.  Talk to you tomorrow,  Kay 
 I have  a better chance of remembering "mamona".  I have to build up to the good stuff.  My home number is 713 973 6325.  If call notes picks up, try me on my cell at 713 304 8716.  Did you find the fax?  You can fax it to me if that speeds up you getting out of the office.  Call and let me know.  Thanks,  Kay 
 So how do you say "bitch" in Spanish? 
 Ben,  I'm at home if you need to reach me before the call, 713 973 6325.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Opps.  I should add that Mr. Hodge has a free pass to miss this and all other NW phone calls.  Kay 
 Hi there,  Just confirming a 200 CST Enron team conference call.  Is this going to work for everyone, with the exception of Carlos, who is now excused?  Kay 
 FYI.  I don't know what I think about this email.  I will say that I've heard good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.  Also, there is a big difference between a transmission project and a power project, since tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint. Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.  Kay 
 John or Marissa, please call me at your convenience on my cell, 713 304 8716.  Thanks,  Kay 
 my cell phone is charging, give me 30 minutes.  ckm 
 Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if he objected.  John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.  Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  Feel free to leave me an email about anything you are working on, as I will be available next week and onward to cover for you.  In fact, if you want to stay home and go with KS to her dr's appt on Monday, I'll be there to cover. In fact, just PLAN to not be there, and if you are, it is a bonus.   I don't you worry about anything when it gets to be baby time.  If you do figure out remote access, I can email you questions and you can answer when it is convenient.  Paige is almost 21, Michael is 6.5.  It goes fast!!!  Ciao,  Kay 
 Please put Carlos Sole on the notice list.  Thanks,  Kay     Lorie Leigh @ ECT 03/23/2001 03:31 PM 
 Hi Bart,  I think it is an East deal, so I wouldn't think it would be dumped on you.  I just think it is nice to see the good stuff.  Kay

Jacoby Executive Director  Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines  Ladies and Gentlemen:  Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main=20 commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (=01&NorthWestern=01= 8) and=20 Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") regarding NorthWestern=01,s purchase thro= ugh=20 the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of= =20 the Turbine Contract referred to below (the =01&Purchase=018) of two (2) Ge= neral=20 Electric (=01&GE=018) 7EA combustion turbines (the =01&Turbines=018), the f= irst of which=20 is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is= =20 scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which= =20 are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May= =20 31, 2000 (the =01&Turbine Contract=018) with respect to which ENA has the r= ight to=20 cause a joint venture limited liability company in which, prior to commerci= al=20 operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-own= ed=20 NorthWestern subsidiary (the =01&NorthWestern Subsidiary=018) holds an 80% = equity=20 interest (the =01&LLC=018) to become the purchaser:  1.  Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin= es=20 (subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific= =20 reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent= =20 with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s= =20 worth.] 2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio= r=20 to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days= =01,=20 written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than= =20 30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20 Purchase).  [What happens at closing?  Payment of the balance?  In the=20 interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a= =20 certain manner?  Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?] 3.  Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20 payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0= =20 million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement= =20 with ENA providing for the Purchase.  The second installment ($5.0 million)= =20 of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing = of=20 the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001. [The remaining $40m due at closing, as= =20 well as any other amounts due to changes, etc?] 4.  Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra= ct=20 [is proper reference to closing?], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract= =20 receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will= =20 give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?] 5.  Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20 purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the= =20 Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the= =20 Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the= =20 unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an= d=20 including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date. 6.  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change= =20 order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of= =20 NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE.  [does this mean they will= =20 be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser? Are we= =20 committing to pay for the increase?  Does the purchase price increase?  Is= =20 there a limit?] 7.  Unpaid Price of Second Turbine:  At the time of closing, one or more=20 installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to= =20 GE under the Turbine Contract (the =01&Unpaid Installments=018).  ENA will = be=20 obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the= =20 Turbine Contract.=20 8.  Guarantees:   There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of= =20 the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligation= s=20 of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under t= he=20 Turbine Contract, as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary= =20 to ENA in connection with the transaction, will be guaranteed by NorthWeste= rn=20 Corporation.  [governing law? Limit on remedies/damages for this letter? Dispute resoluti= on?  NorthWestern and ENA have acknowledged that, subject to review and approval= =20 of the structure of the Purchase and the negotiation of final documentation= =20 relating to the Purchase (which documentation will incorporate the commerci= al=20 terms set forth above), the above commercial terms have received all=20 necessary NorthWestern and ENA internal approvals. [Is this true for Enron?= ] =20 In light of this acknowledgement, NorthWestern and ENA (by signing this=20 letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern)= =20 agree to negotiate, in good faith, to agree upon such structure and such=20 documentation, with a view to executing and delivering a mutually acceptabl= e=20 definitive agreement relating to the Purchase as promptly as practicable. F= or=20 the avoidance of any doubt, it is expressly stated, acknowledged and agreed= =20 that each of NorthWestern and ENA must be satisfied with such structure and= =20 such documentation in its own discretion.  [I question whether there is enough wiggle to keep this from being a bindin= g=20 obligation to sell]  By agreeing to the commercial terms set forth in this letter (by signing th= is=20 letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern),= =20 ENA grants NorthWestern, and NorthWestern grants ENA, an exclusive =01&no s= hop=018=20 period through the close of business on Friday, April 13, 2001; and ENA=20 agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 period, ENA will not discuss or ne= gotiate,=20 directly or indirectly, with any person or entity other than NorthWestern f= or=20 or in respect of the purchase or other acquisition by such person or entity= =20 of the Turbines; and NorthWestern agrees that, during such =01&no shop=018 = period,=20 NorthWestern will not discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, with an= y=20 person or entity other than ENA for or in respect of the purchase or other= =20 acquisition by NorthWestern of turbines from such person or entity..  As=20 consideration for ENA agreeing to such =01&no shop=018 period, NorthWestern= will=20 pay to ENA, via wire transfer on the date of receipt by NorthWestern of ENA= =01,s=20 signed agreement, $1.0 million (the =01& No Shop Payment=018).  The No Shop= Payment=20 will not be subject to refund by ENA for any reason or upon any circumstanc= e=20 (including, without limitation, failure of NorthWestern and ENA to agree up= on=20 the structure of, and enter into a definitive agreement relating to, the=20 Purchase). =20  If ENA is in agreement with the foregoing, then please so indicate by signi= ng=20 this letter in the space provided below and returning the same to=20 NorthWestern (by facsimile at 605/978-2840 and to the attention of the=20 undersigned).

 Sounds perfect.  Unfortunately, Bart works on West deals.  I'll talk to my boss (Jeff Hodge) and see what he says. 
 Evidently Ben told Chris to call.  This is an on going problem.  Kay 
 That will help. 
 Hi John,  I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.  Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.  Kay 
 I saw that Michael Young was included in the email regarding the 100 conference call, so I thought he was planning on phoning in then as well. When will he be calling in?  Kay 
 okey dokey.  I'd let Marissa mess with sending it out.  Kay 
 I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken care of?  You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have electronic copies of the development agreement?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Will there be a "pre-call" for the Enron team?  Kay 
 Chris,  Please do not ask outside counsel to participate in a call, undertake a task, or do anything without talking to me, Carlos, or another Enron lawyer first.  You do not need to call Carolyn and tell her not to participate.  Carlos has taken care of this already.  Kay 
 Thanks.  We'll call you around 100.  Kay 
 Hi Dan,  What's the latest with Suzanne?  Is she home yet?  Do you have her home number/address?  Thanks,  Kay  PS  I'm still out of town. 
 We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.  I've been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop and who hasn't.  However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to make sure you are aware of the deal.  It is the commercial teams desire to enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.  Sorry for the short notice - today is the first day I've been able to pick up my email.  Kay 
 As best I can tell it isn't essential; however, it would probably be helpful.  I know you are on holiday, so if you have something else going on, I wouldn't worry about it.  I can always call you later.  Kay 
 First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday.  I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.  Talk to you Monday.  Kay 
 I'm out of town, but can donate next week.  Kay

 I've spoken to the Brunini firm in Jackson.  Kay 
 Jeff,  It looks like Ben has made some good progress with GE re:  Blue Dog turbines.   This really helps.  As you can see,  I now have email access.  Kay 
 Here is the current draft for your review.  In addition to the changes which were made, there were some valid comments made by Beck and Christi, which I think need to be addressed, but can be addressed in the definitive agreements.  Please revise carefully and let me know if you have any comments.  Kay 
 I know you don't have enough to do...  I can't access the press release part of the Enron intranet site.  There is a blurb that appears at the bottom of all Enron press releases, which is one of those Enron is a leading blah blah blah.  If you can easily find that blub, would you mind forwarding it?  Sorry for asking.  Kay 
 I'm out of pocket the rest of the week. I think the best description is the general Enron Corp description.  It is very generic, and is found at the bottom of all Enron press releases. If I get access, I'll forward it to you - unfortunately I can't access it now.  It is one of those "Enron is a leading blah blah blah" things.  Lots of help I am! 
 Did I send this to you yet? 
 Hi Carlos,  I should be easy to reach on my cell until around 930 Tuesday.  Feel free to call.  In my absence you can feel comfortable talking to Jeff.  He seems pretty reasonable and easy to talk to.  Plus, he knows a lot about Enron stuff.  You will want to discuss the risk memo with him, copying Sheila I guess.  Ask Jeff.  Like I said before, I'll back you up on whatever decisions you make, for whatever that's worth.  My folks  number (just in case you lost it) is 817 292 3367.  Ciao,  Kay 
 I heard a rumor that Carlos Sole has been tasked with the Mitsubishi consent.  I'm sure he will do a great job.  Kay 
 Sorry I didn't come up with more concrete examples.  I'm really concerned about my dad, although I try to deny it.  I still think that we should insulate ENA on the next deal.  Kay 
 http://www.victoria-house.com/lovers.html  then browse! 
 I like it.... 
 Carlos and I are discussing options right now. 
 Every day? 
 I'm working at home today, headed to Fort Worth tomorrow.  I spoke to Carlos shortly after you were up there, and he mentioned you were looking for an org chart, and he recalled that I had sent him one.  Kay 
 FYI. 
 Ben,  I will try to be on at least part of the phone call on Thursday, technology permitting.  Kay 
 Nothing is simple. 
 More org stuff.  Randy must now be with EWS Legal, since I see he is in an office on 38.  Kay 
 Attached for your reading enjoyment is an indicative org chart.  As you might guess, there have been some changes since this was published in December.  Kay 
 I sure hope it is this week.  It will either be this week, or a while.  How's that for keen analysis?  It would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by E Next, we should use the break out form, plus an override letter.  What do you think? 
 Steve,  Merchant Energy Ventures doesn't have auditable financials, but NorthWestern Corporation will give GE a corporate guaranty for MEV. Let me know if you run into difficulty verifying their financial status, as I'm sure we can get you something. In addition, Enron North America will have the responsibility to make the future payments to GE as these payment obligations exist as of the closing.  Kay 
 Hey Andrea,  We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his carotid arteries.  I'm kinda nervous about this one.  Everything else is going well.  Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.  Paige has applied to the Astros for a summer job.  Seems like a long shot, but she really wants to do it.  Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters. His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.  Unfortunately, I haven't met him yet.  I can't wait to hear about your reunion.  I know it will be a blast.  Have fun!  Kay 
 Well, there's a little lesson in the value of being polite to EVERYONE. 
 Here's a general description of the steps:  Letter agreement signed Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC) $ deposited in escrow TurboPark notice given  Closing date:  TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption) LLC signs breakout contract Amended LLC, other closing docs executed Money released from escrow to Enron Enron pays off TurboPark  This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if you see a problem with this process.  Kay 
 Sheila,  If I were starting over again, there are a few things I would change.  First, the development fee as presented in this draft doesn't work.  Second, I would put all the put/call details in the llc agreement.  Third, I would make the put/call available anytime GE agreed to it.  The development fee has been discussed generally, but not fully vetted with Herman.  Kay 
 Don't mean to lecture, especially via email.  Just trying to give some constructive suggestions! 
 Reagan,  FYI, it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel.  If you want me to call David,  just ask.  I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest bugging the other parties' counsel too much.  It uses up relationship capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want to incur.  Another FYI -  I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.  It violates Enron policy.  So once we have outside counsel on board, you still deal directly with me, and I'll manage the outside resources.  It really works better that way.  Kay 
 I cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received.  Yikes.  Sounds like Neil still has a chance for a new shirt.  We'll have to allow extra time next Monday for a double de-brief.  Kay 
 Please confirm that Beck's comments nos 1 and 6 are acceptable for the loi. I would include in this email, but I don't have an electronic version with me.  Reagan, if you have an electronic version, could you forward it to me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Gee, I was kinda hoping we would have the opportunity to dump stuff on EEOS= ,=20 not the other way around. =20  ckm 
 Reagan,  I don't suggest it, especially since this is not an "off the shelf" deal. There are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long run to get someone else involved for a few days. It is like getting a new commercial guy involved for 4 days. I'll defer to the great and powerful Oz.  I should be available most of the day, so let's see how things go.  Kay 
 I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, which should help expedite matters.  Kay 
 I don't have any significant comments, but I picked up a couple of minor typos.  From a structure standpoint, I think Enron doing the construction (and taking price risk) may be a structuring challenge, but I understand that's a bridge to cross later.    Kay  PS  I hope Mark isn't reading this today!  Great wedding. 
 Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.  That's what comes to mind at this point.  Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Reagan,  I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.  I will make the changes you and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime today.  Kay 
 Well, welcome to EWS.  I like Mark Frevert, and I've heard good things abou= t=20 Greg Whalley.  Also, I like working for Mark Haedicke. =20  Kay 
 I really like that one. 
 Hi John,  Sounds like we are now reunited in the same legal group, EWS.  True? =20  Kay 
 Kathleen,  We need to set up an LLC for the Blue Dog turbines.  Chris had proposed some names at some point, then Ben had come up with something.  I now can't remember what it is.  Anyway, it needs to be on the list for next week.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Is that a general offer to help, or just an offer to help me find the Blue Dog contract? 
 Don't be too grateful.  I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what. He obviously values your opinion.  My personal opinion is you put the comments in front of Lee, and if he doesn't like them, the answer to Delta is no, we have no leverage to get your changes.  Kay 
 hey, you're on vacation.  NO WORKING 
 Thanks for the quick turnaround.  Kay 
 Jake is ready to tell Lee who the purchaser is and get permission to "tell all".  I think that's a good way to go.  I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine contract.  I will be glad to do it if you want.  Jake said that Bill Williams had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments were no longer germane.  Bill has received their comments, but I don't know his reaction.  Kay 
 Ok, by now you think I've lost my mind. I can accept that.  I believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the Salmon LLC contract (formerly known as LV Co Gen facility agreement).  Kay 
 As mentioned in my other email... 
 Hi Pete,  There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project.  We are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines.  Sound familiar?  Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called Salmon somethingorother llc.  I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent.  I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the "new" Salmon contract.  I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with.  Carlos Sole  is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.  His number is 713 345 8191.  I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice mail if  you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I figured it was a long shot.  Have a great weekend. 
 Wow. That was quick!  Now I'm out of excuses...  Kay 
 You're on.  He's getting to be such a good age for theater.  ckm 
 Big surprise! 
 My guess would be the week of the 4th of July, then again sometime in August.  I agree that he really should see it.  If you want to take him, that's great, or we will be glad to take him.  Kay 
 I give up.  How in the world did you jump to that crazy conclusion? 
 Hi Janette,  If the tickets are still available, I would love to have them.  I realize I was a little slow on the draw this time!  Thanks,  Kay 
 We are also working on a couple of change orders. 
 I didn't redact it, but Ben might have a copy.  I can email you the electronic file of the intact document. 
 You lost me.  We talked to Jake about it, and the two issues were GE consent and accounting treatment.  At least that's how I remember it.  Kay 
 Needs to be vetted with Herman at some point.  If Jake wants to negotiate something else with GE, I'm all for it. 
 I took her in a while back for the cough, plus she goes in every 6 months for kennel cough and hearworm test.  They haven't said much and I haven't asked. Afraid to, I guess.  I got Kaley when I was with my former boyfriend, and she's been through it all with Paige and me. 
 Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy.  My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.  Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to hang around close to everyone.  I'll miss him when I'm in FW.  ckm 
 Hi Rose,  Was the Blue Dog override letter signed for TurboPark?  I didn't see it in the TurboPark closing docs.  Of course, I could have missed it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I believe this to be the applicable assignment language.  I'm confirming.    Kay 
 Please calendar for me. 
 I'll have to send the notice separately.  John's number is 713 751-3254.  Kay 
 Look at you.  More work! 
 Hi Wilson,  I spoke with David Hunt, and he has no problem with you representing Enron Power Marketing in the proposed transaction with Clarksdale and Yazoo City. Please let me know if you  have any other potential conflicts.  Thanks,  Kay Mann 
 Peggy Banczak is the ENA lawyer who handles Mexico. 
 For better or worse, all the folks under the heading "Origination"  and "Development" are ours, although Kathleen has a special role with Development.  Kay 
 Yes, but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood to the brain.  Big deal kinda stuff. 
 I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal.  Is that ok with you? 
 Hi there.  Is the site plan approval a different document than the development order?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I have a change in plans next week.  My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, so I will be heading that way on Monday.  I was planning to be on vacation anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I would not have had otherwise.  I will manage client expectations accordingly.  Kay 
 I need to have a form filled out that says I don't have health insurance coverage through Enron.  Can you find out who I need to send it to in HR?  Thanks,  Kay 
 OK.    Enron North America Corp. 
 I think he will absolutely love it.  Our wedding is at 4, but we can bring him over earlier if that helps with the museum trip. 
 Hello.  The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any desired changes.  Thank you,  Kay    PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability to do so. 
 I sent it to J. Cogan, but I can send it to other folks as well. 
 Attached is a general bio.  Please let me know if you need something different or additional. 
 How's the weather? 
 Sounds like a family man. 
 Are you available? I thought you might be interested since DDuran will apparently be there.  I'm scheduled for vacation. I'll arrange an invite if you are interested.  Kay 
 For calendar.  I may go straight there in the am. 
 Great.  We would like to take a look at it.  Sounds like something fun for our family.  I'll call to set up a day/time, if that's ok with you.  Kay 
 Life's pretty tough when your mom (opps, he calls me "Mother" now) won't let you watch tv on the way to school!  You guessed right, I really enjoy our time together in the am, and I don't want to compete with Pokemon.  Kay

 Hi Greg,  I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option payment credited to the purchase price of the land.  As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.  Hope you get email!  Kay 
 No.  We can talk about it when you we meet in a little bit. 
 I'm still on it.  We are still working on the term sheet. 
 Maybe on Saturday. 
 fyi 
 Did you look at it on the website?  It looks like fun.  Michael and I could probably have fun on the quiet water days.  I'll need a ladder, so I'll have to break the news to Pop Pop.  Kay 
 Details.  Do they want one of the turbines before Sept? 
 Hi,  I saw your posting concerning the kayak. Do you still have it?  Where is it located?  I may be interested.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks John. I got a huge kick out of Paige struggling with the email to you.  She's a terrific writer, but had horrible writer's block.  I think it was the dose of reality which comes from looking for a job.  Kay 
 Shepherd, near San Felipe.  Very close to Peggy's house. Peggy should be there, also. 
 Got it.  Good hint! 
 Anytime in the next hour is good, since I didn't eat breakfast.  I would love a caffeine free Diet Coke.  ckm

 hi back 
 Please see insurance groups' request re: equipment warranties.  One=20 alternative is to send equipment contracts to David Marshall for  his revie= w.  Kay 
 Dear Mr. Keffer,  Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition, I am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a "behind the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.  This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in touch with the right person would be appreciated.  Sincerely,  Paige Record 
 I guess Ed Hearn. 
 Hi Cindy,  Any more sign ups from Enron?  I'm thinking of sending  a reminder out in the next day or so, and I wanted to see if you  have anyone other than me, Heather and Anne.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI, one of my guys got a call from one of your band of merry men concerning selling the 7EAs. Kay 
 It seems that I remember seeing something about  this in the Titan claim file.  Maybe a copy of it? 
 Have I signed this yet? 
 Do you have the GE contracts in the CA stuff?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Pitiful!  Charlotte confirmed for today? Delmis is cleaning as we write - I spoke to Paige.  She is going to try to get an appt with Cher for cut/color.  I told her we would buy.  ckm 
 My dad is having some health issues, so they couldn't commit to next week.  I cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth, so please take the steps necessary to call that off.  Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to cover for  him.  We'll see.  I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc.  In other words, no big plans, which I'm happy about.  I think Neil will miss Rosco as much as Michael, but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a few days.  Kay 
 Well, I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco to aim at.  I guess Kaley will have to growl at Jack just to stay in practice.  I should add that Kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something urgent comes up, I could have to cover for Carlos.  Not likely but you know how the baby stuff goes.  I think Rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although I don't have any information to go on.  You mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so I guess we should expect him to be big.  Maybe one of those tall Labs.  I just hope his personality stays the same.  Kay 
 Just a reminder that I am planning on being on vacation with my son next week.  My clients are aware of these plans, and I have hopes that things will go without a hitch.  I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail.  Kay 
 Thought you might find this interesting, in some sick way! 
 Hi Chris and Ben,  Wanted to make sure you had seen/approved these.  I'm looking now also.  Kay 
 I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend anyway, so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon appointment so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility that I might need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if I need to go - he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking  him to Moody Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The long term weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that week, but you never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do most of the fishing stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.  If I do go I would like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up with a little work and write you, too.  What do you think?  ckm 
 Well, I'm glad I get to edit!  Not really.  Mark approved it this am.  Hopefully, good publicity which will make Mark glad he approved it.  They usually take pictures to go with the article, so I have to see if I need a new, clean, white shirt.  Gotta look good! Makeup and everything.  Wonder how I lose 15 lbs by Thursday?  Kay 
 Well, you know Enron.  No boredom, ever!  Kay 
 YIPPEEE 
 John,  I've received internal approval to participate.  I'll see what I can come up with for a bio.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the thing I'm doing on Thursday.  Do you have a form of bio for anybody around here?  I need to make something up for the paper.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.  Thanks,  Kay 
 John,  I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress with the site beyond permitting.  As you know, there is no going back once we give up that optionality.  Good catch, Renee.  Kay 
 Hi Jeff,  I don't know if you are picking up email, but just in case,  here's a description of the Roundtable.  Kay 
 Hi Randy,  Just wanted to let you know what it up on CoOp City.  I don't know the agenda for the meeting.  I'm planning on calling in.  Kay 
 Hey guys,  PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.  Lisa has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose Engeldorf.  Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be back in the office tomorrow.  We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through the issue.  As for the "standard" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.  Carlos has recently worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance blessing.  He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could also add some extra insight.  When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to discuss it.  Kay 
 yes, thanks. 
 Good afternoon,  I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal.  Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have sent this out without the usual internal review.  We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 I kinda like Coyote LLC and Black Hills LLC (no spruce). 
 Hi Ed,  I can't find (or recall) that I received the subsequent email referenced in this email.  Can you direct me to the right place?  I looked under Administrator and Legal Net X, and all my emails from 3/8.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm calling in (conference call) for this one. 
 We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.  Any suggestions?  Kay 
 Any idea what will be on the agenda?  It would be very nice if they would respond to the drafts we've sent them.  Kay 
 OK.  I'll let you know tomorrow.  I'm leaving at 330 to take Michael for a check up.  Routine.  Kay 
 Please check the cancellation policy for next week's seminar.  I may not be going.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's where I am.  I haven't finished all of your changes.  Please look for bold stuff, that's where I have questions.  If no question is given, I'm looking for your confirmation. 
 Hi.  I'm interested in joining.  What do I need to do to join?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I am selling my Bayou II kayak by Dagger.  It is a two person, enclosed style, kayak perfect for enjoyable kayaking with a special friend or family member.  Especially good for fishing because one person can paddle and position the boat while the other fishes. 
 Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.  I'm with you - go Delta.  Who wants to mess with the broker issue?  Ciao,  Kay 
 Ann Elizabeth,  Can you handle this?  This is another Florida lobby deal.  Kay 
 Please don't.  I enjoy the laughter!  I was just jealous. 
 Turbine Team,  For future reference we should add in the put/call language (similiar to the language in 6.2 (c) of the Intergen deal) which allows Enron to put the equity to the buyer at any time GE consents.  We should soften the approval rights of the purchaser.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The outside lawyer for Northwestern, Marguerite Kahn, would like to speak with you concerning the structure of the LLC, specifically including the promissory notes.  Guess I didn't explain it all that well. I asked her just to call you directly, and gave her your number.  Thanks,  Kay 
  This was the emergency. 
 We have an agreement which resides in TurboPark.  Kathy Clark did the contract. 
 fax  for car loan 713 345 3555  My contact is Ms. Sammy Marroquin.   Borrower is cynthia kay mann. 
 You know ES doesn't work Fridays, so that takes away one day of opportunity to approve them, plus she hasn't had an assistant.  Maybe things will improve.  She is very excited about her new assistant. 
 Please print. 
 Hi John,  I asked to have ONE guaranty prepared and ONE escrow agreement for Carlos and I to review the forms.  Now I've got two sets of docs sent by two K & S attorneys.  Additionally, we are drafting against ourselves.  The letter agreement and the LLC have been given to the counterparty.  Seems to make more sense to wait for comments.  HELP!!!  Kay 
 Hi Marisa,  Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the same forms. Obviously, we want the economy of doing this once for both transactions.  Also, please bill the time for these forms to Carlos' deal, since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement and the llc forms.  It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the structure is agreed I would keep the letters in as place holders.  Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will have the certificates.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi.  I'm expecting a call from David Hunt,  so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet. The Beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally, but since we haven't, I'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements.     Kay 
 Do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow.  Look forward to meeting you,  Kay  PS.  Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come.  Sheila really wanted you there. 
 I would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through Herman.  There may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what gets booked on mark to market basis, etc.  He may have absolutely nothing to add, but I wouldn't take the chance. 
 Don't forget that Herman reads everything, and to ask Fred if this deal will be DASH'ed.  (I don't know if it should, but probably so.) 
 I think you'll find there isn't that much to a site sale.  Witness Plano/Pontiac as compared to the Peakers. 
 I need staples and the stiff green folders.  I forget what these are called.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I had coconut cream  pie for lunch (also tuna).  I feel so guilty.  Light dinner for me.  And maybe a vodka (NO WINE).  If I can get time to call Nathaniel, I will.  I'm in a conference call now.  I feel guilty about being gone Sat. night if Paige is home for SB.  It does sound like a good weekend weatherwise.  I can check with her to see her preference.  Kay 
 I just like to make Margie work.  So do you think they'll fire Dierker?  I guess you heard Lima is heading to the bullpen. 
 Please print the form agreement.  I think it is the fourth one below. 
 Attached is the Blue Dog LLC agreement: 
 Please print the clean version below.  My computer won't let  me print - I tried two different printers. 
 You are destined for political greatness. 
 And a tough crowd it is.  I'm up for it. He seems genuinely happy for you. 
 No action required, fyi re:  Blue Dog (the East deal) and Project Salmon (the West deal). 
 Frightening roster. 
 Here tis 
 fyi 
 fyi 
 Yes, I'm officially in Elizabeth's group.  I need to ask her for a flat screen monitor. 
 It has now clicked that  you were looking for a letter in addition to the settlement letter.  That didn't sink in before. 
 He doesn't know that Sheila undermined his authority with his client, and intervened.  Remember her saying she wasing going to stay out of it?  Just shoot me if I do that to you.  Or at least kick me.  Kay 
 Having fun yet? 
 This is the turbine contract to print and put on your desk.  Kay 
 Here's more for you to enjoy.  We need to make this into an XYZ form to match up with the letter agreement.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You can run but you can't hide!  Kay

 Thome, Sole - hey, that rhymes... 
 yes, thanks 
 The document on the bottom is the one you are looking for.  I will send one of the exhibits separately.  Kay 
 Hi Jeff,  I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding, so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.  Sheila suggested this firm, and Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.  As you can guess, it is a short list in Mississippi to chose from.  Please let me know what you think.  Kay 
 Nothing from Leatha.  Any news there?  Kay 
 Please put the Friday GE call on my calendar, as well as a 200 call tomorrow on Northwestern.  Thanks! 
 Scott stopped me on 31 to tell me what a good job Carlos did. Thought I would pass it along.  Kay 
 He did go out of his way to sing your praises, so job well done. 
 Aren't you something.  From now on, you are Mr. PSA. 
 fyi 
 This confirms our agreement we reached today that we will start the meeting at 930am Central.  Kay 
 You're killing me. We have no definition for first contingency must run. Is= =20 this the same as First Contingency Emergency Dispatch?  HELPPPPPP. =20  ckm 
 Hi Gregg,  I spoke to John N, and I think I understand what's up.  I'm in a conference call, but will holler later.  Kay 
 Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.  I know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it will be a big issue.  Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors are, that might help.  Kay 
 Time for a battle field promotion.  I'll be Tanto, you can be him that sabes. 
 Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk to you about it.  My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is the most conservative approach.  Kay 
 Atta girl.  You should have heard Ben complementing you to Jeff.  Ben said he wished you worked for him so that he could participate more in your PRC review.  The point was not lost on me! 
 funny, she didn't ask me!  $25 never hurts. 
 100 to dan 
 Lv Co Gen deal. 
 Thanks so much for your help. 
 Since I'm "off" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND without you, I'm not in much better shape.  You know I've kept all my files on email.  I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of something.  Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing - highly inefficient.  I can't do it here, though.  Kay 
 If there are any other resolutions, etc that they want, I would let them prepare them.  Thanks a bunch,  Kay 
 I think what I will do is send out an email today to have people call you directly and reserve a room.  We can then see how many short we are, and deal with the deposit.  I will tell them to inform you that they are with the Enron group.  Names of the individuals should be as follows;  Kay Mann (I'll call with my card soon - I want the Premier) Heather Kroll Barbara Gray Peggy Banczak Lisa Bills Rose Engeldorf Nora Roberts Anne Koehler Lisa Mellencamp Christi Nicolay Gail Brownfeld  Maybe this will help identify those who are REALLY in.  There may be a couple of new ones also.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with the Intergen closing list.  We can get organized on putting together a package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow agreement, etc.  Thanks,  Kay  PS.  You might want to check the docs I sent out to Jake to make sure I didn't put a Panda in a Delta doc.  I checked, but I need to be double checked.  Another good reason to use XYZ's until the finalist is selected. 
 Chris,  Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this, since this is in TurboPark.  Kay 
 You have correctly identified my financial advisor, although I figured this one out by myself.  I think I'll join the credit union! 
 It is the last two weeks of school, I believe. 
 Geriann,  I didn't ask for the conference call, but I wil make time in my schedule to participate. 
 Please fill in the blank: =01&First Contingency Transmission Outage=018 means 
 We are in the process of refining the form in connection with the left coast transaction, and it will be easy to "de-westify" it.  Kay 
 I know you wouldn't forget, but Ms. Bills will need to be advised.  See you tomorrow.  Kay 
 I like this one. 
 Sorry to hear about Bobby's wreck.  I hope he feels ok tomorrow.  Neil's number at work is 713 596 8716, and  his email is nmann@erac.com.  I know you probably checked this, but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance under your auto policy?  Always good to check.  Paige got a kick out of seeing Bobby.  I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine.  I feel the same about going up next week.  There will probably be a more appropriate time later.  Paige is coming home for SB next week.  I suspect she'll come Friday or Saturday, but don't know for sure.  We are probably going to the Matagorda livestock show and auction this weekend, and maybe the rodeo.  It must be good - like the Belton rodeo.  Hi and hugs to all!  Love,  Kay 
 I made a couple of minor revisions.  Jake has given us until when he gets in tomorrow.    I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.  Perhaps it it redundant.  I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.  Maybe we can discuss in the am. 
 No big deal.  I'm just trying to tie up loose ends when I can.  I suspect they must have gotten paid, or else someone would be complaining. 
 Carolyn,  Please use NewCo instead of Spawn.  Also, please give them only one business day to review the final facility agreement.  Also, we need the duplicate forms for Sunlaw Energy Corporation.  Will we be getting the drafts tonight?  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I don't know who started the initialling kick, and I don't know if I care if it continues.  I don't know if Lee cares.  It is probably an EECC artifact. If GE doesn't care, then I don't care.  ( I hear strains of a show tune "I don't care, I don't care").  I think I've lost my mind.  Kay 
 no headaches 
 Please put on my schedule. 
 That means it is recognized, not  "contemplated to be recognized", then?  I= s=20 there such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just schedu= le=20 on their behalf? 
 Before you send out the next draft we need to talk briefly. 
 I'll be available, and will let you know how it goes.  Kay 
 Ben and I can make it.  Kay 
 Cindy,  How long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the charge?  I  think your suggestion will work.  Kay 
 In case I forget to mention it, when the next round of Panda docs are ready, you might want to send them to Herman and Matt.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Sheila,  I don't recall seeing a bill from Bracewell on the VECPCO deal.  Did you ever see one come in?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good.  I hadn't heard back from them. 
 Hi Carolyn,  In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other thoughts:  Letter agreement:  I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability.  2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 (a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.  3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement.  5 (d)  change 1st "shall" to "'may".  7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific performance?  9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't want to contradict it with the rep.  I'll review the LLC agreement next.  Kay 
 Please call Jake Thomas and Steve Thome in Portland and see if we can have a conference call at 500 Houston time.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I hadn't heard the 2 1/2 hour deal, but then again, I wasn't on the call. I'll check on pushing the meeting back to 930 to give you a chance to get downtown before it starts.  Sheila, what do you think?  Kay 
 Thanks. 
 This was supposed to be to Jeff and Barbara, but the phone rang.  I can't recall who knows what.  Kay 
 Jeff,  Are you up-to-speed on this one?  Kay 
 900 central, so you should be in decent shape.  Kay 
 Opps. 
 It is an hour and a half west of Memphis.  No where.  You can smell the meat processing plant.  Hey, you would probably like that! 
 Carolyn,  I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate, not takeover.  Please verify with the LV CoGen documents which I forwarded just a few moments ago. The changes I made to the definitions in the prototype letter were a result of the fact that the Blue Dog contract with GE uses slightly different terminology than the LM 6000 contracts.  We need to revert to the appropriate underlying contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Leatha,  I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are mentioned in your explanation.  Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include the tax trade on the Lexus?  Thanks for your help,  Kay 
    New Auto/Boat/Sports Vehicle/Camper Trailer/Motor Home    loan amount term (maximum) fixed rate (apr) To 100% of Purchase Price 36 Months 8.00%  48 Months 8.25%  60 Months 8.40% New auto only 72 Months 8.75% To 90% of Purchase Price 36 Months 7.75%  48 Months 8.00%  60 Months 8.15% New auto only 72 Months 8.50%

 An exhibit... 
 A treat for you... 
 Hi Pete,  Would it be possible for you to be in Houston this Friday morning for the GE meeting?  It would be great to meet you in person, and have you participate. What is your availability?  Kay 
 Chris,  Please come see Carlos and I about the transaction.  Kay 
 Obviously this is going complicate (and increase the cost) of the transaction.  Is there any way to push back on this?  We will now need four break out contracts, four sets of every other document, 4 sets of assigning docs out of TurboPark, etc....  Not hard to do, but a challenge to do on your time frame.  Kay 
 I guess someone thought of this again.  I'll wait to see what Ben says.  This is when I'm out of town, which is fine by me.  Kay 
 You know so much!!!!! 
 This is who Sheila suggested.  The deal I'm working on is an asset management/control area services transaction.  It will be an odd one, so I'm not expecting someone to have specific expertise.  I need help on the general contracting under Miss law stuff, especially since there are some quirks involved.  Your input would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Kay 
 1988 Jeep Cherokee Laredo, good condition, 4WD, A/C, automatic windows and locks, cruise control, 100,000+miles, will take $2000.  Please call Jonathan at 713-853-7910. 
 I heard a rumor that you have TurboPark closing docs.  Could I get a copy?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I can't locate the electronic version of Costs that David prepared.  Can you resend it to me? 
 Re;  enovate/Peoples 
 Here are my responses:  1. Development fee is a commercial question.  This will need to be vetted with Herman if we go with it.  Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next week.  2.  I have a call in to Dale.  3.  No LLC.  Kathleen will handle.  The closer the creation is to the signing of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up.  Someone needs to name it.  We should also look at a minimal list of officers.  4.  I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it up.  I'll get back to you.  The concept is that ENA is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.  I thought the language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed! As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the definitional questions. It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract with GE, but I won't make that assumption.  Drop dead date on put/call Dec. 2002.  5. This needs to be discussed with Ben.  6.  This should be set up as a  new matter, since these aren't the Blue Dog turbines. You can send the bill to Sheila with a copy to me.  I'll open the doc and take a look at it asap.   Kay 
 They haven't signed the other ones.  We moved the equipment straight out of TurboPark and into the llc, then on the same day sold down the equity of the llc.  Please call to discuss at your convenience.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Marchris,  I'm in ENA Legal, and I'm looking for the right person to discuss this with. Christi Nicholay suggested I get you involved.  Please give me a call at 713 345 7566 to discuss.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Great trip back.  I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.  Don't make a point of spending your vacation there!  Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy?  I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.  Kay 
 That is very cool.  Rosco has gone from 14 pounds to 27 pounds in one month.  That's a half a pound a day. 
 Many thanks! 
 I had to cancel due to my travel schedule.  I have a staff meeting every first and third Wednesday, which I've told Sheila about.  On those weeks I'll miss the call.  Ta ta,  Kay 
 I have a staff meeting and will be unable to join.  I do plan to be on Friday's call.  Kay 
 Have you checked this out? 
 How cool is that. 
 fyi.  Comment? 
 I'll check.  Thanks for the help.  Kay 
 This is the one I get to go to, right? 
 Hi Cindy,  Would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people make their reservations?  I'm thinking maybe ten rooms for May 4, 5, and 6, out on the 7th?  I would like it best if the individuals could call you directly to make the reservation.  How does that work for you?  Thanks,  Kay 
 latest on my system, but I'll check. 
 Ben,  What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check to see what the drill is on this side of the street.  Kay 
 Please find his contact information for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Rosco was in for his shots today.  On Feb 3 he weighed 14.6 lbs.  He now weighs 27 lbs.  His paws look too big and his head is too small.  What an adventure!  ckm 
 Hi Leatha,  Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.  They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.  When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to "work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.  I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus.  Thanks,  Kay 
 That reminds me.  There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such things.  I don't remember where it is - PR?  I wonder who would know? 
 Travel plans for Monday. 
 I'm so ready. 
 Greg,  I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it.  However, it doesn't answer the question for me as to whether a Mississippi court would uphold such a clause, or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue. Due to the importance of the issue I will consult with a Mississippi firm to get a handle on the question.  Thanks for your help,  Kay 
 Thank you for your helpful comments.  Good points.  On the timing issue, we still have the time sensitivity, but I hate to give it a precise day.  Maybe the way to address that is within 10 BD's, as mutually agreed.  I don't have the doc in front of me (I'm in Florida), but I thought it said ENA was taking responsibility for increases in the Purchase Amount as it exists the date of closing.  I'll check.  I agree with deleting CO definition.  It doesn't add anything.  Again, thanks.  Kay 
 Just let me know when you get bored... 
 Yes. 
 Stuart,  If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).  The letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need to sign.  I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I requested it anyway.  Kay 
 Anyone know any good lawyers in Mississippi, or any lawyers knowledgeable about Mississippi law?  Power background would be nice, but I know that may be too much to ask.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  Please look this over, spell check, print and fax two copies to me, as we will be signing this doc this afternoon.  Ciao,  Kay 
 I've sent Sheila and Dale electronic copies of the documents. 
 It should be signed and on its way.  I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a chance to send me the preamble stuff?  I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/  Thanks,  Kay 
 As I mentioned, I think the "new and improved" versions are better starting points, but here's what we used.  I don't recall whether the concept of a development fee has been vetted with the accountants, as it wasn't applicable to the Intergen deal.  Kay 
 We had to amend the agreements to give us more time.  The new version I sent you fixed that. 
 I don't know if this was the final one... 
 See my previous email. 
 Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you can see some of the definitions, etc.  One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is exercised.  I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.  Kay 
 I did write it for them, and sent it to Lynn.  We are waiting for them to sign it and send it back.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sorry for the delay.  I ran into some complications.  I left it "in blank" so we can fill in the commercial specifics depending on the purchaser, etc.  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  Could you check this and see if I did anything stupid with the revisions:    Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the revised form for the Blue Dog equipment:    Kay 
 I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive commercial direction.  Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough.  Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff?  Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to combine the two at once, given the short timeframe?  Has Dave signed the extension, by the way?  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?  The munies are specifically citing Section  100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have faxed me an opinion of the Mississippi AG interpreting this section. If you will email me your fax number I will fax it to you.  Kay 
 Lynn Dekrey is the guy Mitch negotiated the deal with.  Lynn left me a message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a day we could expect the letter.  I would expect it this week.  ckm 
 Westinghouse has agreed that LJM doesn't need to sign it.  I sent SW a letter confirming that agreement.  Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon. Otherwise, the agreement is fully executed.  ckm 
 I haven't heard back from Dale.  Sheila and I have swapped voice mails.  Kay 
 Charlotte,  Great story!  Neil is at the Astrodome now. You might be able to reach him on his cell or by pager.  If I hear from him I will have him give you a call.  I'm in Florida, and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by. Wouldn't Michael go crazy?  Bye,  Kay 
 Hi.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Kay 
 Here's another document I need to have faxed to me:    Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print and fax the redlined version to me at the hotel.  Thanks,  Kay  ps  I'm in room 706 
 Thank you.  This is very helpful. 
 fyi 
 There's nothing special here.  Just cloudy.  I took Roscoe in to get neutered.  Neil just couldn't handle it.  Men are so funny like that.  Now I'm going to run some errands.  I hope the weather gets better for this evening.  They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, and it looks like it is getting better.  Still more of a deal south of here.  Kay 
 I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last name?  That would be cool.  I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!  ckm

 I've just learned that this is a "West" deal for the sale of the LV Co Gen units.  This deal was described as being the same as the Intergen deal.  King & Spalding helped me on that one, and when I thought this was an East deal I contacted Keffer for a conflicts check (there is none).  I haven't gone to Mark with it yet, though.  We have forms, etc for this, and I'm happy to provide whatever support I can.  Please advise as to how you would like to proceed.  Kay

 I set it as my new wallpaper.  The file was too big - SU wouldn't let it come in. 
 Maybe this is more like rugby.  I passing the ball to Carlos, who will get with you and Kathleen to figure out what's what. 
 Well, I just don't know what to tell you.  If nothing else I think the ball was punted to the east.  Kay

 Hi there,  Did you come up with a "form" llc agreement in conjunction with the form letter agreement, or is the Coral LLC agreement the latest thing?  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 Here's a new deal for you.  I've got two follow on deals for K & S, so this one might be a good one to use someone else, if you need and want to. (I hear the rustling of the pines..)  Clear outside counsel selections with Jeff, then Mark, etc.  Kay

 Hi Pete,  Can you send me the most recent version of the LV Co Gen facility agreement? Also, in a separate email could you send me the C of A?  I want to make sure I have the latest, greatest of each.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please get with Fred to get something working.  Thanks,  ckm 
 Thanks, but I'm throwing away junk all weekend.  Neil will be gone.... 
 I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.  Thanks anyway.  Kay 
 Fred,  Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming?  What are you projecting for a closing date?  We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?  If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready.  If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.  Kay 
 Sheila,  If you are working on this I think it makes more sense for you to have Ed handle the CA.  I don't want to get in the middle.  Thanks,  Kay 
 No idea.  Whenever he gets around to it, I guess. 
 I think the pager is just too cool.  I don't think Mark has talked to Jeff or Barbara about the move.  Kinda awkward!  ckm

 Hi Steve,  I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last draft.   Guess you can say this is a sanity check!  If it looks good to you, then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.  Kay 
 In fact those are the only two days I'm around!  Hope to see you.  I'm in 3882.  ckm 
 Hi Karen,  Sorry I haven't sent the notice.  Brain cramp or something.    When are you here next week?  Kay 
 Well, maybe it makes more sense to write it like this:  (see below) 
 No biggie, and understandable.  When we sell the equipment we structure it= =20 like we did on the CA deal - we sell the special purpose companies that wil= l=20 own the equipment at the time of sale. =20 
 The form we have has this as the first paragraph, which is different from t= he=20 form attached.  Could you conform the NW one to the form?  Enron North America Corp.

 Hi Carolyn,  Is this the most current version?  Thanks,  Kay 
 My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent out, and won't be for a day or two.  It can't be sent out until the CA is returned to you signed. 
 Mr. Sorte,  Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this confidentiality agreement to your attention.  Regards,  Kay Mann 
 Here's the CA you requested.    Kay 
 Yes, because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking. 
 I know I will be hearing from Gregg about this soon.  Any progress?  Thanks,  Kay

 Hi there,  Does anyone have a Finance/Accounting blessed professional services agreement?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases, was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content. This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers. Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing. Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its "New Edge" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps. Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone. Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling even more, while increasing interior room. Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002 Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment, although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does intrude through the floor. New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac traction/stability control system will also be available. The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market, but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float your boat. 
 very interesting!

 This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.  We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.  I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?  I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.  I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just in case you are sending anyone else's today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Well, I told Michael that Bronco could ride in the wagon, so I guess he needs a wagon big enough for Bronco!  ckm 
 Hi there,  I'm thinking of working out after work - hopefully kind of early.  Ok with you?  I should still be home before 730.  Michael took Bronco to school.  I'm sure he will have him at the CC.  Kay

 As I mentioned to Scott, we are engaged in active discussions with PB (on behalf of Co Op City) concerning whether Enron will have any role in the EPC activities.

I discussed this with Mark, and he is fine with postponing the meeting.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I haven't worked with any workout folks.  Do you know Lisa Mellencamp (in ENA Legal)?  She isn't in that area any more, but she used to be.  She might know the players.  Kay 
 Hi Pete,  Here are some comments from GE re confidentiality. Please hang on to the comments pending further direction.  If you are available today for the conference call, it might be helpful for you to listen in for a while.  If you have a conflict, don't worry about it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Congratulations on your promotions, which demonstrate that ethical standards (coupled with stubborness) deserve to be  rewarded!  Kay 
 Speaking of tennis, Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play.  Neil said no, since he doesn't know how.  I told him I can play, and now Michael thinks I should play with him, then he will teach Neil.  Very elaborate plan!  Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house?  Can you believe we never broke a window?  We have a detached garage, but the door is metal. I can't imagine how loud that would be!  I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.  Pushing NEVER helped.  She can swim and ride, so I guess it worked out ok.  She never showed any interest in playing on a sports team, even though she used to go to my softball games.  Whatever.  Time to go home!  Love,  Kay 
 How do I get on the list for the form?  Could you pretty please check for me?  Thanks,  Kay

 Hey there,  I'm going to try very hard to make it to Dick's farewell party.  Who did the invitations?  It is so clever.  Kay 
 I think Tuesday, 2/27, looks good. 
 Just a reminder. 
 Here are my initial comments:  There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.  Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing.  Kay 
 Bronco is on the sofa upstairs. 
 No problem.  I appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it.  Kay 
 Hi Shirley,  Is this meeting still set for tomorrow?  I heard a rumor that it had been changed again, but I don't know if it is correct.  Kay 
 Barbara,  Here's the latest word I have on the meeting, which sets it for tomorrow.  Is there something later which sets it for today?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to any particular terms in the definitive docs.  I don't see why we would need to DASH exclusivity.  See you soon,  Kay 
 Hi!  I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.  You gotta love President's Day.  We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired today.  I'm too old to go out on a school night!  Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled. Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous to me, but I don't really know anything about it.  Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I believe this dr.  Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.  Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as usual around here.  Say "hey" to everyone.  Love,  Kay 
 Pete,  These comments are from our Finance group.  These are FYI at this time; further discussions to follow.  Kay 
 Talk to you when you get back. 
 So when are you leaving today? 
 I would like a copy of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Site Plan Approvals, please. Thanks,  Kay 
 No can do.  Thanks anyway. 
 I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years.  Oh my gosh.  At least I know how to work out, and I know not to take it to the limit the first time out, but it is still hard to move.  I didn't exercise my legs or my back much, figuring that's what I'll need most this weekend for yard work.  I think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball.  I took an abs class, since I need to get my abs (and back) in shape to protect myself from injury.  I could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus!  The Met was plenty convenient.  They have a  spa there now, with all the spa stuff.  ckm

 Hot off the presses.  I'm looking at it now. 
 Gentlemen,  I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this time.  Kay 
 As you know, Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate. Our group in Chicago is looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate. We had initially envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how Enron would invest the funds, etc.  The other owner of enovate, Peoples, has proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this arrrangement.  This is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise, so I'm writing you guys for input, direction, etc.  Suggestions? Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote?  Kay 
 Hi Gregg,  I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will follow up  with a phone call.  I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow.  I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.  Kay 
 Hi John,  I haven't been able to find you number.  I wanted to discuss the confidentiality agreements, and whether you envision that other confidentiality agreements may be necessary or required.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?  Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?  Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails, so I'm sending this along.  Kay 
 One of us can. 
 Hi there,  On the options we should delete the reference to the Federal Arbitration Act, so that the sentence with that reference ends with "binding arbitration".  I changed it on the confidentiality agreement, but missed it here.  Carlos caught it.  Kay 
 More for the contract... 
 Hi Pete,  Here's some language to be included in the form contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Choice of law doesn't impact place of arbitration.  We just need a starting position... 
 Yes. 
 I set up a directory called "Confidentiality Agreements" and put a form in there based on what KC sent me.  I'm so proud of myself. 
 1. Remedies, Jurisdiction, Arbitration and Governing Law.  Money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Optionor, and the Optionee shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies upon proof of any such breach.  Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by Optionor or any of its Representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Optionee. Excepting the right of Optionee to seek such relief, all claims and matters in question arising out of this Agreement or the relationship between the parties created by this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  There shall be three arbitrators. Each party shall designate an arbitrator, who need not be neutral, within 30 days of receiving notification of the filing with the AAA of a demand for arbitration.  The two arbitrators so designated shall elect a third arbitrator.  If either party fails to designate an arbitrator within the time specified or the two parties' arbitrators fail to designate a third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointments, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. It is expressly agreed that the arbitrators shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, the parties hereby waiving their right, if any, to recover punitive or exemplary damages, either in arbitration or in litigation. The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York. 
 I'm not doing a good job of time management, so yoga is looking doubtful. 
 Sounds like a good approach to me. 
 Thank you.  I appreciate it. 
 Rusty,  I will get with Kathleen and we will prepare on a form.  However, you will need to provide one of us with the details on a case-by-case basis, so that we (Kathleen) can generate the CA's and track them in the legal department database.  If we have the following information, a CA can typically be generated on a same day basis:  name, address of counterparty, including name of contact person type of deal contemplated what type of information is being provided whether both parties are providing information whether exclusivity/non-circumvention provisions are desired   Thanks,  Kay 
 Let's discuss.

 We had a good time.  I always enjoy Ozzie and Heather. Carlos joined us, too.  Ozzie has a new Mercedes convertible, and he drove me to Michael's babysitter to pick him up.  Michael's eyes were the size of saucers!  ckm

 Anything for the grocery list, my sweetie pie? 
 Please calendar.  I don't know if I'm going to be out of town. 
 Hi Mark,  I don't know  what these folks are up to.  In fact, I didn't know that Scott Laidlaw was involved.  When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA developer.  Any word from the Co Op/PB team?  I have jury duty in just a little while, so I'll be out of touch for a short while.  Kay 
 You might find Stephanie and ask for a copy. This is a very nifty reference tool. 
 Thanks for agreeing to help.  Please call Ben Jacoby to get things going.  Kay 
 I don't know the dynamic between the Intergen team and Team Coral.  Assuming there's no bad blood, I don't suppose it would hurt.  I just don't know enough about the situation.  I have jury duty today, by the way.  Kay 
 Hi Tana,  A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk Management Glossary booklets.  Am I getting close? I've found it to be very helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole. Could I get a copy for him?  Any other good power references?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Sharon,  Michael will pass on next week's appointment.  He and I have the day off together, so I'm making some special rodeo plans.  His winter report from his teachers was good.  He is meeting or exceeding expectations in all categories.  We recently visited at school and watched him for about an hour, and he was attending very well, sitting still (well, relative to the other kids), following instructions, raising his hand to be called upon, etc. You should have heard him speak Spanish - it was so cute. We visited in the am, and I haven't seen him in the afternoon without meds. The class schedule hasn't required an afternoon dose as of yet.  Hope all is well with you.  Kay 
 Oh, yeah, that's right..... 
 Please print 4 execution copies of this from my o drive  Clarksdale/MDEA ILA/extension May 29  Please date the letter today.  Thanks,  kay 
 I'm all for that.  I may take him out very early to look at the tractors. 
 Do you want to include Mike Sandridge also?  Kathleen?  I'm happy to volunteer my assistant, Suzanne, to help with the logistics, restaurant suggestions, keeping track of rsvp's.  Kay 
 As far as I know it is fine. 
 Yes.  At least now I don't also have lunch with John! 
 This looks good to me.  We'll track down Janet if that is ok with you.  Kay 
 Hi Charlotte,  What's your preference today?  I can either meet you at our house, or pick up Michael at your place.  Kay 
 I want to go to this on Thursday.  I rsvp'd myself. 
 Hi.  Lisa (Mellencamp) and Chuck are getting married, date unknown.  He has given up his apartment and has moved in.  That makes 6 teenage girls under one roof, although 3 of them are there every other weekend.  I really like both of them, so I think this is nifty.  Kay 
 John and Randy,  I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions to the Co Op City EPC contract.  Specifically, I deleted language he had added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that said that the waiver was "subject to" the indemnification section of the contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.  Just wanted to pass this along.  Kay 
 Hi Randy,  Here's what you missed.  My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing issues at this point since I don't have the outside counsel doing anything now.  When John called me last week and asked the question I gave him that opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.  Sorry about that!  Kay 
 Did he say what happened?  I thought he wasn't taking her until next week. 
 I'm going! 
 The posted number was a mistake. 
 Please call John Keffer and re-schedule Thursday's lunch - two meeting have come up.  Friday is good for me.  713 751 3255 
 I've been researching the Pathfinder today.  Nissan has a pretty good website.  I like the little videoscreen - how's that for a toy?  I'll go back and look at the Toyota.  ckm 
 I had a nice trip in.  I tried a slightly different route, and it was uneventful.  Kinda slick, though.  How much does it cost to mail a letter now?  Is is $.34?  Of course I have a bunch of 33 cent stamps.  I have no clue how much rock that would be.  I should measure the length of the beds, then I could compute how much to get, at least sort of.  There's some grass to be dug up also.  I think I will start with the Advil today! 
 This might be really helpful. 
 Did I miss anything? 
 Here are the AES documents. 
     ?EDMUNDS' REVIEW  Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty. Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked against newer competitors. So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter, DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25 foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear. The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD, automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on the dashboard. We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling, further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws. You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents. All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after Christmas, don't we?). A "Birdview" navigation system, shared with the Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the "Birdview" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions. Get a map. Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations. Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of the Dodo.

 Thank you.  I really liked Don. 
 Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle. Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size, the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too. Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop). Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i). The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a 2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The four-speed automatic transmission provides a "snow mode" for easy starts on slippery surfaces. With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck (car?) back under control. In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional. Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather upholstery is available on V6 models. Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll bet demand outstrips supply. B 
 My dad has the same thing as Sheila's mom (athlersclerosis).  He gets tired easily, and doesn't walk very well.  But at least he can still walk!  He's only 70, but this stuff is progressive.  A long future is unlikely.  Michael adores his PopPop, and March is a nice time of year on the cost.  If I'm there I can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad, which helps.  What kind of vehicle to you have?  I've decided that I need an SUV. 
 I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.  Fridge foraging is fine.  I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace myself.  Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly. Guess I should go look.  ckm 
 Poor baby!  At least it is only twice a year, or in her case, this one last time.  I think I may take him fishing with my dad and mom in Palacios.  He really loves it, and my dad is in declining  health, but can still get around.  I hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together.  ckm 
 Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am. 
 I'm having a set printed.  Kay 
 Please print.  Thanks,  Kay 
 How depressing.  I really was liking the idea of a Durango.  I do think Lisa and Bobby have been pleased with theirs, but maybe they've just been lucky.  Mitsubishi isn't attractive to me, but I don't know why.  I really can't think of much unless I go back to the idea of the small Lexus.  The big one is just too expensive.  I don't want a Ford (that knocks out a lot), you don't like the 4 Runner, and the Land Cruiser is too expensive also.  I don't remember being particularly impressed with either the Yukon or the Tahoo.  What else is there?  ckm 
 Sheila,  I have jury duty on Wednesday.  ckm 
 I'm desperate.  HELP!!!!!!  We have a meeting with Duran et al today, and I really wanted to brouse through this before then. 
 Hi Pete,  We want the GE form to be on an individual turbine basis.  As for work priorities, I would put it in front of the City of Austin agreement.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I sent him an email earlier, and he left me a voice mail back.  I'll call him and see what I can find out. 
 Fred,  Sounds "do able".  Please contemplate what would be acceptable as "outs" for them and for us.  A,lso, will you be getting RAC involved soon since we are contemplating a binding agreement in the near future?  My best guess is that the LOI will be prepared in house, but I will discuss this with Carlos, and we will advise K & S of their role.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI. Note that PSEG wants to sign a binding LOI.  Carlos and I will discuss how to move forward.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Looks like it is ok to keep the same.  How's the GE master form agreement coming along?  When do you think we will have a draft?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hopefully you will get some credit for it, also.  I just love Lisa.  I think she's a ton of fun. 
 FYI. I have jury duty on Wednesday, Feb 14.  Kay 
 Hi.  This is one of my top priorities.  I think it looks fine.  What do you think?  Kay 
 If it were me I'd go for the standard limo, mostly because I've never seen the other kind. 
 Please draft a letter to the guy listed in the first email below (Hartzell at ITM), using the stuff in Chris' email as the body of the letter.  Save under General LOI, and I'll finish the letter.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Did anything get set up?  I'm booked at 200, but otherwise available.  Kay 
 fyi, we have staff meetings on the first and third Wednesdays, at 130.  The meetings usually last an hour or less.  ckm 
 Good morning,  Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.  So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard looks.  I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is looking better, though.  Hope you are having a good day.  Love,  ckm 
 Hi Mark,  Here's the latest, incorporating the "arrange for" approach on the EPC and O&M.    Kay 
 Lee,  I've forwarded your email to Eric, and have asked for his response.  The changes were his.  Thanks,  Kay  ps  Thanks for the invite Friday.  We had a great time. 
 Hi there,  Any comment?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Previous correspondence on the topic of assignment to outside counsel.  See 10/10 email from me below. 
 FYI:  another instance of  work being sent directly to outside counsel.  In this case it was an additional assignment related to an ongoing project.  Kay 
 My only advice is to be very specific in their scope.  These guys run up bills worse than anyone. 
 200 is late enough for anyone to be out.  I'm all for the limo taking people home at that time.  I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.  Are you taking Friday off?  Kay 
 I have your rodeo tickets.  The total is $114.  Kay 
 Fred,  When you need something for a project, please come to me first (or whoever might be the appropriate ENA lawyer).  Going directly to the outside lawyer creates problems. For instance, it is Enron policy that we do  not pay outside counsel for work not referred to them by an ENA lawyer.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm leaving now. 
 Gentlemen,  Attached for your review is a draft of the letter of intent.    Please let me know if you have any difficulty opening this document.  Kay 
 FYI. 
 How many times do I have to say EMAIL IT? 
 In your presentation today you mentioned an assessment agreement and an interconnection agreement.  Roger says he isn't working on it.  Who in Legal is handling those docs?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I appreciate the heads up -  I'll try to chase down the fax (it hasn't been delivered yet).  Can you email me the blacklines just in case?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Chris,  Your invoice for December reflects final revisions to the documents through December 20th, so I'm assuming the draft the Schaeffer's signed was done subsequent to anything transmitted on December 13th.   However, emailing documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help.  Thanks for your response,  Kay 
 I think it is fine to send it to Lee and Kent. 
 Here's where I'll be tomorrow. 
 Sounds great. 
 Hi John,  Just opened my email.  I have a meeting tomorrow off campus.  Next week looks good, though.  Any free days?  Kay 
 Looks good to me. 
 Attached is the form of option agreement for the Schaeffer option which passes muster.  The changes are relatively minor, but have significance from an accounting and legal perspective.    Kay 
 He's going to be at the birthday party or at Matt's.  Maybe we should drop him off. 
 Pardon the delay, but I inadvertently left you off the email.  Kay 
 John,  I think I misspoke (or miswrote).  The change I suggested would belong in both versions. 
 Hi John,  The enovate version looks fine.  I suggest this change to the Peoples versi= on:  iv) is required to be disclosed to comply with any applicable law, order,= =20 regulation or ruling or to enforce enovate=01,s or PMW=01,s rights in court= or in=20 an arbitration proceeding in connection with the Limited Liability Company= =20 Agreement of envoate dated April 26, 2000, as amended, modified, and=20 supplemented from time to time (the =01&LLC Agreement=018).

 please calendar. 
 Wanna come up? 
 Could you check out the sitter thing?  We could drop off Michael and take the Enron Field shuttle.  I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do it. 
 Hi.  How's it going?  Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.  The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.  I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't a lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.  Love,  ckm 
 OPPS.  I registered twice.  I'm just taking up one seat that day!  Kay 
 I'm getting hourly updates.  I haven't talked to John today.  Carlos tell you about the security guard by HR? 
 Same city, different Westin.  This one is on the Riverwalk, the other was near the Hyatt.  I like San Antonio for the trip though.  Easy!  Busy as usual.  Love,  Kay 
 Here is  a draft for your review, and if you think appropriate, distribution to NJR.  Please let me know if you want changes made.    Kay 
 Scooped me on Ray.  I like him.  I heard Debbie Chance is transferring to another group, and that Reagan is going to be an originator (not a developer). 
 Hi,  Things are going just fine here.  I'm looking forward to spring - baseball and gardening.  I want more weather like last weekend.  I was in NYC last week.  I managed to get lost walking around Midtown.  I know, that's impossible.  I was talking on my cell and walking.  I walked from Bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater district.  Oh, I should add I was headed to the Omni at 52nd and Madison. When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead, it clicked that I was off track.  My feet hurt so badly when I got back I could hardly stand it.  Are you going to spring training this year?  Gotta get back to work. Thanks for writing.  Kay 
 Muchas gracias! 
 Karen,  It appears to  me that revisions were made to this agreement, and the agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me being consulted.  Perhaps you did email this to me and I can't locate the electonic file.  In any event, in the future, please call me on the telephone  BEFORE revisions are made to documents and presented to the counterparty.  If you can't reach me by phone, send me an explanatory email. Also, please email me redlines against prior drafts.  This will faciliate my review.  Faxing drafts does not work for me.  I will send you the required changes tomorrow.  Thank you,  Kay 
 Here 'tis: 
 ok.  I thought it was a lot to ask. 
 Brian,  I didn't get the revised draft.  Kay 
 Gregg,  I think I'm in good shape and can look at what John sent tonight.  Ed, just stand by and I'll holler if I need anything.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thank you. 
 I'll forward the email and you can print and fax.  No big deal. 
 Hi there,  Lee doesn't remember getting a fax from me yesterday.  Did you get a confirmation back?  It was the same fax that was sent to Pete Thompson.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Doug,  I hear you are working on the Midway deal.  Me, too.   I want to go back to the restaurant  you suggested with the remarkable decor and wine list (was it Burns, something like that?).  I look forward to working with you on this one.  Kay 
 Lee just called, and he is here, so if you haven't called him yet, please don't.  Kay 
 Do you mean LITERALLY across the street?  Yikes.  That's making it tough to ignore.  Steak doesn't really appeal to me.  Maybe a Ciro's salad?  ckm 
 Please call Lee Johnson and tell him that one of our development lawyers, Roger Balog, would like 2 tickets for Friday.  I hear Ben wants a ticket for Thursday, but I assume he communicated that to Lee.  Thank him for me, but I have my closing dinner tomorrow, and no sitter Friday.  713 803 0952  Thanks,  Kay 
 Absolutely. 
 Here's a first stab at the LOI.  I just guessed on the attachment.  I have a couple of questions:  Any thought as to how we get/split money (other than the obvious up side for us)?  Do we want to work toward a "Project Development Agreement" which will set forth the basis for how we develop projects on a project-by-project basis? Or do you envision a different next step?  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 Ben Jacoby is having an offsite Friday at the Hyatt for the East Development group to discuss 2001.  He has asked me (and I think Roger) to sit in. I'm planning on attending.  I'm sure either or both of you are welcome, although it won't be a problem if you don't attend.  Kay 
 I don't think we need the language, especially since the guarantees won't apply to retrofitting the plant later. 
 Just use a regular CA (yes, I changed my mind), describe as a power generation transaction (no equipment reference).  Thanks,  kay 
 Please let me talk to Ben.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Has Herman seen this or the 1st amendment? 
 Quien es mas macho? 
 One thing to put on the list (which may be there all ready) is that we want our officers/directors to effectively resign at closing.  Another detail (and note who is getting this email):  I've had three instances recently where agreements have been forwarded to the counterparty prior to legal review.  As much as I hate to suggest this, it may be best to have the drafts forwarded to Enron Legal before the commercial team receives the docs.  Kay 
 Dick,  Thanks for your reply.  I have since been assured that we will build on what has happened thus far, which is a huge relief to me.  If we see forward progress tomorrow we will be all smiles.  Again, thanks for your reply.  Kay 
 Makes sense to me. 
 Does this mean the LV Co Gen deal has fallen apart, or are there some new LM's in our future? 
 Per your voice mail.  Kay 
 Hi Randy,  Could you fax or email me a copy of the EECC Mou with PB or Riverbay, or whoever.  My fax number is 713 304 8716.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Do you need the electronic file?  All I sent was the redline. 
 Renee,  Question: Are the GE performance guarantees completely voided by the use of inlet chillers?  The first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me.  I'm not sure how the stuff included in the second series of bullet points fits in.  Are these changes in scope, suggestions, conditions?  I think we would be better off increasing the length of the change order to include the pertinent stuff, but not attaching the letter as a reference.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Where's Ben's name? 
 How's Glenn doing with my binder?  Lots of Midway activity this week.  Thanks,  Kay 
 As a follow up to my previous e-mail, here is the second request, which was in my opinion adequately addressed by John Schwartzenburg. I am frustrated with beginning the process over again.  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  This was my first written request for a cost plus contract.  The request was made to NEPCO because at that time NEPCO was supposedly still involved in the project. I left subsequent voice mails for Dave and John Schwartzenburg, then mailed a follow up email to the gang at noon on Thursday, February 1st, copying various folks at EECC.  John Schwartzenburg was out of town, but went out of his way to accommodate my request so that by Thursday evening, I had a form from EECC. I worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project, and forwarded it to EECC on Monday.  I received no response to the revised draft.  I have recently heard that the EECC form that I spent worked on is being scrapped, and we are starting over.  Is this true?  Kay 
 Innovative is a euphemism for something,  but I can't figure out the right word.  What every means "Company Most Likely to Exhaust its Lawyers with Impossible Structures and Processes"....  ckm 
 It is just too far out of your way.  I'll try to see if I can catch a ride somewhere.  ckm 
 Yeah well.  Next week! 
 Yes, I'd be glad to talk to him.  I know we want to build generation in New York (the next state to have brown outs).  Until Carlos gets settled in send the guys to me.  Trust me, it won't take long to get him settled in!  Kathleen, do we have a land holding company for that region?  I want to think about a  two-tiered approach due to balance sheet issues created by expensive land.  I'll think about it from a TurboPark standpoint also.  Kay 
 I'm not leaving town... 
 Hey there.  I'm back in the saddle again.  I'll get crackin'  Kay 
 I will have a minute in about an hour. 
 Lee asked that I pass this along.  Please let me know if you want some tickets.  Kay 
 for calendar, especially 930 
 I'm a little concerned about the neighborhood (no offense), but I thought you could drive by at lunch.  They also have a facility at the St. Regis school. Lastly, if you watch as you drive home (I know you are looking around anyway) you might see a church with a sign up, etc.  Maybe Grace Presby might have something.  I'm concerned about bringing Michael downtown because of my travel schedule.  Kay 
 Next Monday? 
 I'm faxing a page because the email wouldn't go through.  Kay

 For your reading pleasure.  I would add that I told them that their role would need to be defined by you, the developer, and Technical Support.  ckm 
 Here's what Eric wrote:   I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.  Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a separate word file.  Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it. 
 Hi Pete,  I'm attaching parts of an email I received from one of our technical folks regarding the C of Austin turbine contract.  I have to send it in pieces because it is so large.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi there,  Did I ever send this to you?  This one is back on the radar screen.   Thanks,  Kay 
 We need to finish up with the site specific agreement for the equipment, then they can have the whole enchilada.  I would think it could be ready in a week.  I'll get A & K to dust it off.  Kay 
 Come look. 
 Chris,  The docs you sent me that I asked about are titled: Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Midway Grove, and Articles of Incorporation of Midway Grove Property Owners Association, Inc.  I'm a bit unclear as to how the attached relate to those docs, but I must confess to having not read all of the previously sent documents or the two docs on this email.  It would help if you could connect the dots for me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the answer to the tax and accounting questions. 
 They put it in the middle of the wall.  Please have them come back and put it behind my door.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm tied up but you don't need me anyway. 
 Here's a first draft.  I can't find a working printer to print to (what a way to work), so I haven't printed it yet.  If you can print a copy, I would appreciate it.  Kay 
 That just means there is plenty of work to go around! 
 Fred,  I suggest a phone call among the team today to make sure we are all on the same wave length.  What is your schedule?  Thanks,  Kay 
 JD approved referral of this to Keffer et al.  Fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty - his preference is yesterday.  I would think that a discussion with Fred about the deal might be in order today, even if by phone.  What is your availability?  John/Carolyn, have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any notions about how to structure this deal?  Is the format ok?  Can we  make it more seller friendly without being ridiculous?  When the initial draft is ready, it will need to go to Matt Gockerman (ENA Tax) and Herman Manis (structuring accountant).  Ciao,  ckm 
 Hi there,  Please get someone to hang my white board behind my door.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Opps.  I thought we were talking about the same CO.  Could you please send me  a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by reference?  This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.  Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?  I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.  Thanks (and sorry for the confusion),  Kay 
 I hear Erik Kingshill is moving on.  Also Paul Myford is looking for a new spot.  What a lot of changes.  ckm 
 Anytime which works for you is fine, as this is more important than my other meeting. 
 When I travel for more than one day, I usually take my computer and use it on the road.  Hope you are enjoying this perfect weather!  Love,  Kay 
 I'm having copies made of the due diligence binders. 
 Please print all of these.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please check the last couple of pages and see if I'm close.    Kay 
 I had Mexican food for lunch, so LITE dinner for me.  I had lunch with Oz and Heather.  Oz drove us in his new MB convertible.  Really nice.  It is a 430, silver.  How's your day? 
 I should have included you.  Sorry! 
 Hi there,  I've made some suggested changes on the CO you sent.  In the interest of time I'm sending this to David Marshall, since this largely deals with ROL and insurance, and I couldn't tell if he has read this previously.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes.  I got someone else to help me.  Thanks anyway. 
 It is a CompareRite document.  If you "view" it in email, then you can save it as a Word document.  If this doesn't work, let me know and I'll create a Word doc.  Kay 
 Yes, however, I could use an electronic version if one is readily available (I have the PDF).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Rebecca,  Have they issued the news one yet?  If not, I would add the following language:   February 2, 2001  The Chase Manhattan Bank Documentary Division 717 Travis Street Houston, Texas  77002-8300  GE Packaged Power 16415 Jacintoport Blvd. Houston, Texas  77015  To Whom It May Concern:  Enron North America Corp., as Agent for E-Next Generation, L.L.C. hereby requests that Chase Manhattan Bank cancel the following letters of credit (which have previously been returned to GE) upon issuance of corresponding letters of credit for CA Energy Development I, CA Energy Development II, and (who did the last one go to?)

Sincerely,   Ben Jacoby Attorney-in-Fact Enron North America Corp. 
 Please email the letter to me before Ben signs it.  Thanks. 
 This should be good enough.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I  checked all my emails, and I don't have any indication that I received/reviewed this version of the document.  The redline is the redline against the last version I have on file.  If the other folks sign before it has been reviewed internally, it is possible that changes will be required. It won't be extensive.  I will ask Karen Way to call me before making changes to drafts, or at least advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly.  Kay 
 This is a slam dunk. Don't screw it up.  Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.  John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership. For real?  I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.  Kay 
 Hi there.  Nothings comes off the list.  New additions are as follows:  New transaction with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, relating to the creation of a jointly owned control area to address generation,  transmission, and retail load delivery.  It is brand-spanking new, so I don't know much more than this.  It is being handled by Ozzie Pagan.  New opportunity with New Jersey Natural to develop projects using Fuel Cells.  Heather Kroll is the contact.  Sale of Blue Dog (GE) turbine.  Likely buyer (at last word) is NRG.  Could be complicated if GE protests.  There's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from GE, but I haven't been contacted.  The rumor came from GE reps, who asked if I was working on it.  Sheila isn't handling, either, last I knew.  Everything else is the same.  I expect to be in NYC in the middle of the week to continue negotiations on the Co Op City deal (with Mark Bernstein).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Hi there. This came in while I was on the road.  Mac mentioned his girlfriend, but he didn't mention the Rice thing.  Hmmm. We would love to have him at UH, since he won't aim any higher, and we thing it beats SWTS.  He and his friend were wonderful house guests.  I hope no one got worse on your b day.  Many happy returns!  Love,  Kay 
 How's about we talk about it?  I think that's more efficient.  As long as we talk before the next call, we should be in good shape.  Kay 
 done 
 Not yet.  We are working on a solution.   Kay 
 I know we don't do the bbq, but I would think about this... 
 Yes, but let me review it  before anyone else sees it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You might hear from Mac tonight (hope so!).  You can give him my cell phone for when he gets in, and we can leave a key under the doormat.  Gotta go meet Mark.  Love,  Kay 
 I'm in NYC, returning tomorrow.  Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling, but I really didn't think we would hear from him again before today.  We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind.  Paige got a new one for Christmas, and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House.  We enjoyed our visit also.  Thanks for everything.  Sorry to hear about the girls.  Tis the season.  I hope Lisa has a nice birthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.  Gotta go meet someone.  Love,  Kay 
 Many thanks.  When I first started in the E & C bidness all our company did was cost plus work.  I may have some old exhibits about how the mulitplier was used to capture benefits and burdens, both for field people and home office.  You know the goal is to never create an original document!  Kay 
 It doesn't look like it is going to work out to meet  today.  We should be back next week, though.  Kay 
 Please print the second agreement (the letter agreement) and fax to me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the first one...  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Gerry,  I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.  If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very disruptive of my self-perception.  Ciao,  Kay 
 Both of these are capitalized terms in rev 23.  Is there a difference?  Load Projection Model is in definitions, but Load Forecasting Model is used quite a bit.  ckm 
 Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having someone fax it to me?  I'll email my fax number to you.  Much Grass,  Kay 
 Here tis! 
 kinda cute... 
 Gentlemen,  As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in order to get a working draft prepared for this project.  As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks.  Do you have some free time today?  I'm not sure about our schedule, but if we have free time which matches up with you, I would like to spend some time discussing the issues.  Kay 
 I agree that we don't need outside counsel on the call at this point.  If I'm available, I'm happy to participate.  The scheduling problem is due to my travel plans.  I'll join in if the call is at a time I can fit in. Otherwise, I'll catch up with you later about the results of the call.  Kay 
 Hi John,  Mark and I are still working at the hotel, waiting to hear from the=20 counterparty. =20  Could you forward this to Jon?  I don't have his email address.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm flying home tomorrow, but I won't be in the office.  Does today look better?  WE NEED CARLOS!  I've picked up several new deals this week, a couple of them would be perfect for Carlos.  Kay 
 Did I send this to you yet?  Kay 
 Could you email me the list of issues you have encountered thus far.  Ben really wants me to check with you. (I'm so proud!!)  Kay 
 Hi John,  I'm out of town, but will give this a look when I return.  Kay 
 Please email me whatever version of the doc you sent to them.  When it is time for discussions meaningful discussions I would like to be involved.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi.  There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could you email it to me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 OK.  Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway.  Kay 
 Please give this a look and take a first stab at it.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Fred,  If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination? I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!  On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I made it to NYC with no problem.  The weather is nice enough, but windy. I'm on my way to a meeting. 
 Imagine that. 
 I just noticed a glitch, which I'll fix.  Do you have any comments? 
 I need your EXCEPTIONAL help with this... 
 Figured you did, but better to be safe than sorry! 
 I've sent it to the Finance group who will obtain LJM signature.  If I have any problem (ie, it looks like it won't be done this week), I'll let you know so maybe you can expedite on the commercial side.  I'd like to give them a day or two first.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Ace,  I'm a lawyer at ENA.  We are selling some of our peakers, and in conjunction with the sale we have agreed to not contest Siemens Westinghouse retaining the Blue Girl reservation payments.  SW has asked that LJM sign off on the agreement, and Rose has suggested that I send the original agreements to you, and indicated that she would help coordinate signature.  Your help is appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay  x57566 
 Hi.  I paged you soon after I left the school, but never heard back.  I also tried your cell, but it said it wasn't on.  Are you plugged in today?  ckm 
 View it, don't launch it, then you can print it. 
 Hi David,  The owner is willing to do this cost plus.  Do you have a cost plus form that you like?  It was good to see you yesterday, by the way.  Do you want me to include you on follow up emails on this?  Kay 
 Here we go with a renewal that puts us to 7.6%, but the purchase price is not so much. 
 I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically.    I've forwarded the current version to Herman for his review and approval. Due to some of the changes, Enron may need some revisions as well.  Kay 
 Sorry about this.  I forgot!  I'll give it a look. 
 $25? 
 Let's discuss. 
 I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two lawyers I know about.  Kay 
 Here's the option we discussed yesterday.  It has some farm tenancy stuff which I want to make sure you see.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Have you asked Rusty?  I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday.  I made the changes myself. 
 This is important stuff.  Pop quiz material.  Kay 
 When you get a minute I need to discuss the last attachment for the Co Op term sheet (the asset management one).  Here's the current state of the draft:    We do not have a current CA with PB.  I will have one in the am to send out.  Do you want Jude, et al to look at the EPC contract stuff?  Kay 
 Could you check with Ben to see if he wants a set? 
 You're right, it sounds better spoken than it looks written.  I get the point, though.  4ish my time looks good.  Kay 
 Geez, lots of choices.  Your vote?  ckm 
 Did I write you back?  Everything is going well here.  I like the work a lot, and I have some nice clients.  I can't wait for Carlos to get here, though.  I went to Izzo's going away reception last week.  Boy, there are a lot of new faces over there.  In in New York the rest of the week.  Maybe next week.  I hope you keep baby pictures with you at all times!  Kay 
 I don't know if David Hunt will have comments.  In any event, Marvin, Bob and the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.  Reagan has my current requests.  Kay 
 Make that Brinckerhoff. 
 I need a reciprocal confidentiality agreement with:  Parson, Brninderhoff, Quade  & Douglas One Penn Plaza New York, NY 10119  attn: Mr. Stephen Losi  re: potential asset management transaction with Riverbay Corporation relating to Co Op City.  One year term.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes, please. 
 FYI.  You are welcome to join us.  Kay 
 Well, there's no instant gratification with that, although it is logical. 
 How about some new carpet?  I HATE THE CARPET IN THE BEDROOM, although it does hide dog hair well.  If we want to stick with dark carpet, I like the green upstairs.  ckm 
 Gotta hear about your trip.  Was it fun? 
 How about a ca with PB Power (or Parsons Brinckerhoff Power)?  Thanks,  Kay 
 There's a monthly birthday party thing at 300 up here.  I know you don't always get the word, so here's the word.  How's your brother?  ckm 
 This place is more difficult than it needs to be. 
 I saw Scott Dieball at Mr. Izzo's going away reception, and shared the happy news that we voted unanimously for him to set up the next conference call.  Kay 
 Works for me. 
 Do we have a ca with either Co Op City or a company called Riverbay something or other?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I have a meeting at EECC which is scheduled from  1130-130, but there is a risk it will run long.  300 would be better.  Thanks for setting this up.  Kay 
 Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:  Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake. We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer. Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.  Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for some information on his background.  SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a turbine/generator set) to Calpine.  Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw. We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as funding is figured out.  There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.  GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.  I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.  Kay 
 Hi Clark,  Good to hear from you.  I'm headed to NYC this week, so lunch doesn't look good.  I would love to see Nancy, though.  She did a very nice job for us.  I can't find any information on Corey.  Can you give me a little background information?  I couldn't find him in the BP directory or website.  Hope all is well with you, and I hope we can get together soon.  Kay 
 I don't think Carolyn needs them, but I will think about it. 
 I was supposed to make a "To Do" list of the World Hunger Team:  Limit of liability/Indemnity - Steve has provided a draft.  Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes, the basic issues remain for discussion.  Confidentiality - Mike has circulated a revised draft.  Termination - This ones on my list.  Warranty - Scott has some comments to discuss.  We also discussed streamlining the time lines, etc.  Kay 
 I wanted to make sure that you saw this. 
 Please email me a brief overview of what these documents are, how they fit into the overall picture, and the issues which need the most scrutiny. Additionally, have these been evaluated in light of Enron's balance sheet and financing issues?  Thanks,  Kay

 Corey,  Thanks.  Was the doc based on any previous Enron transactions?  Thanks,  Kay 
 It should be under Diaz, Ann, if she got an invite.  Surely she got invited. 
 Any idea what the going rate is for a limo on a Thursday?  Nothing extraordinary needed, just your basic version.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Ann,  I'll be there.  Thanks,  Kay 
 OK. 
 Note change from Def to Clay. 
 Ok.  My hubby tells me the tickets you want are available, and he'll put your name on them, so to speak.  Kay 
 Well, that's something I hadn't heard before.  They should let that be known, don't you think?  At least now WE know it!  Kay 
 This is the same lady from yesterday/this am.  How does the fifth ticket work? 
 Well? 
 Good idea about taking the sausage.  Are you going to the store?  If you do, I could use some Diet Coke, silver and gold. 
 I called him. 
 Guess what?  The closing party isn't until Feb. 8.  I had the wrong week! Glad I didn't show up on the wrong day....  BEAUTIFUL weather.  Might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail (or equivalent) tonight.  I had Mexican food for lunch, so popcorn for dinner!  Love,  Kay 
 Well,  there's an argument to be made that the remedy for breach of an option agreement is us suing them for specific performance, ie, making them sell us the land.  Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement, I don't worry about arbitration.  Let me think about it, though. 
 We have 4 of each of these available at $19 (or whatever face value is). Just let me know what you want to do.  Thanks,  Kay 
 okey dokey 
 Hi Kathleen,  I'm having difficulty reading parts of paragraphs 15 and 17.  Are these=20 jumbled on your screen?  Thanks,  ckm 
 I'm available any time Friday, and tomorrow afternoon is fine, especially after 230.   Kay 
 Hi Charlotte,  We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.  They pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if you might consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).  I suspect most days he could go to your place.  I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would run it by you early on.  I have to think about how much travel I might have, as it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.  Paige has applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we would be in good shape.  Here's a link.   They have some neat themes.  http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm  Have you heard of any other good day camps?  You seem to be plugged in fairly well.  Thanks,  Kay 
 At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.  I'll miss the Turbopark closing dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a headache.  I will miss getting the pat on the back.  I didn't want to miss Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.  As you know, things are subjec to change.  Kay 
 I'm all for getting as much booked in Q1 as possible. 
 I just noticed that I forgot to send you the originals of the letter=20 agreements.  I will have the ABB contract picked up at the same time.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here is one option.  The problem would be getting him picked up when I'm out of town.  Charlotte might be able to help.  Also, there's the Presby church. I wonder if SOTW has something.  He might enjoy a visit.  I just got to work and got my computer up and going.  Yes, the whole ordeal was 1 1/2 hours.  ckm 
 Well, I hope this won't be too complicated.  Did you hire Cory, and if so, what did you think? 
 FYI.  No action required. 
 No TurboPark?  No GE or ABB issues?  I feel like I'm missing something....  I'll get up to speed asap.  Kay 
 FYI.  These is in essence the sale of two of the Illinois development sites that I worked on.  I'll follow up.  Kay 
 I presume that you would just as soon continue to follow this?  Kay 
 I have a note on my calendar that Michael has an appt with SS today.  Has it been cancelled? 
 I'm sorry, I thought that you would remember that this is one of the Chicago/People things, since we recently discussed Jones, Day,, etc. My bad.  Kay

 Looks fine to me. 
 Just got it, so I haven't read it.  Please let me know what you think.  Kay 
 ENA Legal (TBD) 1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project (O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement, etc.).  2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.  3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the structure.   Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been agreed. 2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained. 3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to vendors. 4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as possible.  Forms of "standard" agreements should be discussed/agreed to enhance consistency. 5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the existence of such service agreements. 6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts. 
 Tomorrow is fine.  Kay 
 I'm glad that Michael had the opportunity to meet Dr. B.  Thanks for making that happen.  Kay 
 So are you Gold?  If not, go ahead and use the miles if you want. 
 Please see if you can get me 30 minutes via phone with John Klauberg at 130 today.  He mentioned in his voice mail that he might want to bring in someone else from his firm,  which is fine.  Mark Bernstein will also be on the call.  I'll call him at 130 (CST) if he is available.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Whatcha think? 
 I need a Heather deal to work on.  Good luck in Conn!  Kay 
 I can only open it if I launch it.  I can't view it.  You  might try that.  I think I can print it. 
 Here's the latest... 
 Hi.  Who can meet when? 
 ABB is asking for its original of the facility agreement.  In fact, I need to get originals of the ABB and GE facility agreements to ABB and GE.  When can I get those docs?  Thanks,  Kay 
 You sound so pitiful.  I haven't forgotten you!  Kay 
 I'll follow up. 
 Mitch,  I need to get the LJM signatures.  I've spoken with the Finance folks who can help with this, and I'll try to get that wrapped up asap.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hi.  Charlotte is taking Michael home because they were going to McDonald's. Will you be leaving for home at 600? 
 I think Sheila probably got this invitation.  I'm planning on going assuming I'm in town. 
 Sheila would like to re-schedule tomorrow's call for Friday.  Could you send out an email to the GE/Enron group to find the best time?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Rogelio,  Congratulations.  That is quite an honor.  Regards,  Kay Mann 
 Are any of these available? 
 For Tom H. 
 As promissed. 
 I'll send you the final doc's so we can discuss.  I generated the forms, then finance and the banks commented on the forms.  Kay 
 Hi there. 
 Hi Ben,  Has anyone asked you to take a look at this?  If not, I would be interested in your comments.  Kay 
 FYI 
 Could you forward the attachment referenced in your email?  (we all do that) 
 Sounds fine to me.  Kay 
 Sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties.  I've sent a draft to their counsel all ready (D Hunt and Hemleben).  ckm 
 This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).  Is there any special deal on payment for the change order?  I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc.  Kay 
 You might check out this link and look at the classes.  I haven't been able to take anything but orientation yet, but I hear great things about the classes. 
 713 304 8716 
 My trip cancelled, so I'm around.  I can pick Michael up at your place if this is easier for you.  Kay 
 Does this mean they didn't have to induce?  Please tell her congrats if you talk to her.  Kay 
 Should have included you guys as well. 
 He is chatty in the am.  I enjoy the ride with him.  I'll let CB know that I'm in town.  Kay 
 This term sheet relates to a new deal of Mark Bernstein's.  We haven't responded to it yet.  I suspect you will be consulted about it soon, so I thought I would give you a heads up.  Roger and Herman have heard a bit about the project, and Joe D has been briefed.  Looks like more for TurboPark.  Kay 
 I saw pictures on the tv screens on one of the floors, but I didn't hear about the capture.  How did they do it? 
 need defn of above 
 I figure longer life expectancy is just to make up for all the crummy female days we have.  We probably have the same number of quality days as men.  If that! 
 Here's something to look at.    Kay 
 I think you should send them back to Lee and let him dispose of them. 
 Here 'tis.  I don't think it compared the charts, but it found lots of other things to compare.    Kay 
 I didn't go back and check, but I believe the bills of sale or the assignment/assumption agreement may help, as one of these should have the serial number.  I think you may have a spread sheet that ties serial numbers to unit numbers.  At least I hope so!  Let me know if this doesn't get you what you need.  Kay 
 Are you ok?  ckm 
 Please calendar for Sheila and me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You might have this info anyway.... 
 Yes, but you would have to track down all those people. 
 Hi there.  Is this required by our agreement, or just a nice touch?  We have a fairly long list of people who we would have to track down, and it seems to me that these people can be replaced (or have been) without the formality of resigning.  I'll send you the list separately.  Thanks,  Kay 
 So have you figured out how to use the portal from home?  I just discovered it yesterday (while at the office).  We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation, which was fine. Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse, which was wonderful. Yesterday I cooked, shopped, and puttered in the yard.  Got the last caladium bulbs in the ground.   I like to wait until they are on sale.  The weekend just flew by.  "They" say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome. Go figure.  At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep.  Car seats, strollers and diapers are 100x better now.  Especially the diapers.  Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy.  Just came to me in the kitchen.  I have a 50/50 chance of being right!  When I was in Austin I used an "above the water" pedal kayak.  Talk about easy.  Neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best.  The above the water is more stable than I expected.  I had assumed that it would be tippy, but it really wasn't.  Hope you have high water and not hell next weekend.  ckm 
 This looks like too much trouble. 
 I am scheduled to be out of the office Tues-Thurs of this week.  I will be in New York with Mark Bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the Co Op City deal.  This is one of the asset management deals I'm working on for the NE Power Team.  I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still the possibility that it might cancel.  Kay 
 John,  We have a sitter lined up, so Feb. 2 sounds great for dinner.  Neil and I are looking forward to it.  Kay 
 I think I'm going to be in NYC tomorrow, otherwise I'd say  your place.  I'll find out what Neil thinks.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Your vote? 
 Hi Charlotte,  We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take care of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him off.  Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.  Kay 
 Sandra,  Can you confirm that a non-smoking room was requested?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi.  We can get a computer hook up through Time Warner for $15 month.  Could you ask John if he likes it?  Can it be installed anywhere in the house?  Thanks,  Kay 
 This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.  It is amazing how things have changed.  Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs? That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get used to.  Kay 
 Shall I check with Charlotte about dinner at Keffer's?  ckm 
 I'm feeling fine today. 
 Could you let me know how many there are, so I'll know how we want to handle this. 
 Hope you feel better soon! 
 Did you check out the link to the spandex picture?

 Antitrust Division Won't Challenge Electricity Distribution Cooperative  WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could find no lessening of competition in any electric power market. The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide electric service predominantly to rural consumers. Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income to its member/customers. Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1, 2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas will change greatly. Consumers now purchase electricity only from the regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is located. Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's door under regulated distribution charges. The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's regulated transmission and distribution activities. To ensure that the utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the transmission and distribution system operations are required to function independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at retail. The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an alternative energy service provider. Distribution cooperatives, under the act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or they may assign them to an affiliate. The rates for the standard service package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission. The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers throughout Arkansas. All retail marketing activities outside the traditional local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through the joint marketing venture. If a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for any and all consumers. The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its default customers to the joint venture. Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint venture is likely to market. The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members.  Procompetitive Effects  In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not appear to have any anticompetitive effect. He commented that "while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition." Melamed added that "the existence of other, larger potential entrants into [the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate, any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the distribution cooperatives." The business review letter is available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/--the Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004. 
 You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in the future.  I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA. I do not know their function or role.  As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say that it would depend on the comment.  Essentially, the deals are ENA deals, not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility.  Also, ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the contractor.  The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals) is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a contractor.  So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and the EPC contractor.  Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the negotiation process.  Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how things worked when I was with EECC.  On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place?  I'll let you know if I think of anything else.  I suspect Sheila will have some insight, also.  Kay 
 Hi.  Hope things are going well for you and your shadow.  I don't feel so good, so I'm seriously considering going home.  ckm 
 John,  I appreciated your help.  I'm glad we got to do a real deal, even if it was a strange one.  More to come!  I'll check on the sitter, but dinner on the 2nd sounds great.  Kay 
 I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want. 
 Heather,  Attached is the CA we discussed.  I changed the last paragraph to add the expiration of the exclusivity provision, as I think this is probably a bit easier to enforce.  Kay 
 Hi Chris,  Happy New Year.  Hope all is going well with you.  We miss you!  I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.  The guys around here are kicking around some different asset management ideas, so I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into some  different approaches.  Do you have anything you can email me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Yes, please. 
 He also has white tennies. 
 I'll be in meetings in and out of the office until around noon.  I sure would like to get out of here by 600 tonight.  Wish me luck!  Thanks for putting the dogs out and taking Michael to school.  Sorry about the doggie accident.  It will take time.  I checked the kindergarten website, but it didn't have any info re Wear White Day.  I can pretty well figure out what he is supposed to wear (white), but I'm not sure why.  I believe the 19th is MLK's real birthday, if that has any significance.  That's not much info, I know...  Hope you have a good day.  ckm 
 I love these stories! 
 Enron has signed the docs, except for the revised escrow instructions, yet to be received.  Ben will be coming to  your offices at 900, so he can sign the instructions at that time.  I've pulled the financing documents from the stacks.  I hope to have a copies of the docs tomorrow, and if so, I'll have something to give Intergen.  See you tomorrow!  Kay 
 Gee, when's the Super Bowl?  That was nice of her.  My day is HECTIC, but what's new. I can't seem to get any traction on getting things done.  Michael wanted to go to Jilian's tonight, but I told him no.  ckm 
 Evidently we are experiencing some technical difficulty on this end.  The task should be finished shortly. 
 It needs to be sent to Lisa Bills, Roseann Engeldorf, and Ben Jacoby for approval.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Pete,  I intended for you to call me about Rigby's comments to discuss.  I don't know that ENA is willing to accept all of what he wants.  Please call to discuss implications of his comments.  Kay 
 For your review. 
 Please make the  requested change to the signature blocks on the following docs in my CA directory:  EXECUTIONCOPY Bill of Sale (CAED I)  EXECUTION COPY Assumption with GE ack (CAEDI)  EXECUTION COPY Bill of Sale (CAEDII)  EXECUTION COPY Assumption re ABB (CAEDII)  EXECUTION COPY Assumption with GE ack (CAEDII) (I think this is the correct name)  When this is completed, please email these agreements to Karl, copy to me and Kathleen Carnahan  Thanks,  Kay 
 Wow, Rebecca was reading my mind! 
 Just wanted to confirm that we are moving ahead for the Intergen closings.  Lisa, I spoke with Karl, and he has promised to let me know if there any hitches on their end.  His preliminary assessment was that everything was ok, but he wants to check.  Ben, Kathleen will be bringing the documents to you to initial this afternoon, then I will sign off so Janet can execute the documents.  Rebecca, please confirm that Carolyn has the final wiring instructions for the movement of money out of escrow.  I presume that we would like to close early enough to see money move tomorrow, since the payoff amounts have been calculated based on closing tomorrow.  I don't know what is required to make the payoff to TurboPark, so I hope someone knowledgeable is handling that end.  My trip was postponed, so I'm around.  Kay 
 Pete,  I suggest that Exhibit S state that GE has received all sums owing, without a reference to who paid it, since they will have been paid from multiple sources.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the slide presentation from yesterday's meeting with the NE Power Team.  Kay 
 Good question.  I'll ask around. 
 Enron is entitled to an additional output guarantee when we have 6 or more units installed in a facility.  Peter missed the point, and I didn't catch it because I really didn't look at FV very closely at all.   Rigby caught it. He disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional guarantee, and I will try to figure out his point.  Kay 
 What is your preference when there is a  conflict between the interim agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.  (For instance, the definition of ancillary services.)  Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it represent the customers' expectations?  Kay 
 Please add back in.  You might want to hunt down that fax and see what you think about the suggestions.  Kay 
 Pete,  I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC (our affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the Fountain Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for plants comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in this case. Was it deleted intentionally?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I have a conflict.  How about 300? 
 See attachment. 
 Pete,  I sent change order #4 to you and Paul on November 3rd, via email.  I will resend it if you can't find it.  Kay 
 I feel fairly confident that you received change orders 1-4.  If not, please advise.  One of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the LV Co Gen equipment. 
 Hi Ben,  I got an opinion from outside counsel.  I'll give it a look so we can discuss.  I'll move it up on the list.  Kay 
 Al,  If the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of E-Next (aka the project company) it would seem that the Transfer Date should probably be redefined to reference an assignment to an unaffiliated company. Same thought on the GE override.  This is because the override will still be in effect if E-Next owns the equity in the assignee.  Kay 
 FYI.  Seems like this is something you should ok. 
 print job,  please.  How was your weekend?  I had a good one. 
 Hi.  My trip was postponed until next week.  There's a happy hour (official/formal) for my client groups.  It would probably be a good idea for me to stop by, but it isn't mandatory.   ckm 
 Please cancel the hotel.  I suspect the whole trip will cancel, but I don't want to give up the flights yet.  Kay  ps  THANKS!!! 
 GE posts an LOC in lieu of retainage. 
 Here's my stab at it:    I'll be in an off site the rest of the day.  I have no pride of authorship.  I'm unclear which entity will be signing the agreements, so I've left some []'s. 
 The Intergen LOC should be in CAED I and CAED II's names, issued after closing on the 18th.  The PSCO deal team should handle the PSCO LOC, which should be in the name of the PSCO project company, I think, after that deal closes this week.  Al Larsen and Sheila Tweed can address these.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 I'm thinking that the 1st paragraph of the GE override letter needs massaging, since it refers to the master agreement.  I'll be glad to do it when I can, but I'm knee deep in the ABB agreement at this point.  Kay 
 Kathleen,  There were three original assignment and assumption agreements:  One of CAED I (GE) and two for CAED II (one for GE, one for ABB).  I only see two in my packet, and only two are referenced in the transmittal letter.  HELP!!!!!!!! This is obviously urgent.  Kay

 My trip may be back on for tomorrow.  I'll know more later.  I have a meeting from noon-500 this afternoon, at the Hyatt.  Today looks crazy.  Does Charlotte know how to pick up Michael, and about Rosco?  Love,  ckm 
 This is where I will be this afternoon.  Kay 
 Plse  have fax delivered home.  Today is the day.  I have been a mom for 21 years.  Can't be true.  Still on conference call.  Ben has been very nice. 
 David,  Is it possible for MDEA to purchase power from EPMI as an agent for the Cities?  This will obviate the need for any type of security.  Thanks,  Kay 
 yes, yes, and yes.  You're on a roll.... 
 Unless someone else volunteers, I guess I'll do the ABB override letter. I've mentioned it to Pete Thompson, but he is in our offices today, so he can't do it.  Rob Taylor did the initial draft of the GE version, but Rose finished it, with a bit of help from me.  It should be a fairly short letter.  ckm 
 Hi Elizabeth,  Congratulations on your promotion!!!!!  Kay 
 Congratulations on your promotion.  You deserve it!!!!  Kay 
 Please do what you can to find out what is going on. I know you forwarded these to Carolyn, but I would still appreciate it if you could investigate, or ask Carolyn to do so.  Kay 
 Ok, I'm out of it.  Where's she going? 
 Thanks for hanging in there and getting it done.  How come you didn't tell me that you didn't get Ben's initials?  I never expect to have to follow up with you to see if you did what we discussed.  I just always assume that you've taken care of it, unless you tell me otherwise.  I don't want to change my expectations.  Deal?  Kay 
 I ordered these for Christmas, and am totally aghast that these orders are just now being processed.  What is going on?  I am appalled that this wasn't handled weeks ago.  Kay Mann 713 973 6325 
 The agreements haven't been executed, so please revise.  Could you also set me up a stand alone release, so that I can replace the release GE submitted on some of the other turbines?  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think your suggestion about the effective date was quite logical, but it seems to me that it is more of a Sweetgum issue than ours.  Unless you think we have a problem, I'm ok with going along with George on this.  I presume the original LLC agreement  allows for either the Member to sign or an Officer of the LLC.  I also assume that Janet Dietrich is an officer of both CA's.  Therefore, I'm fine with your suggestion.  Kay 
 Have you talked to Karl yet?  Do you mind calling him?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Congrats!  I sent this on to the lawyer for Global Finance (TurboPark team), also, as part of SOP.  ckm 
 Fred and Rebecca should be talking to Accounting about this. Do you want me to respond to your email and copy them?  ckm 
 I agree.  Please revise the form accordingly.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  I left a stack of initialled docs on the appointed chair in my office.  If you will email me Janet's telephone number, I will call and leave a voice mail about you bringing her the docs to sign.  Thanks,  Kay 
 It doesn't need to be a VP.  It was a function previously performed by EECC contracts people.  Ben initialled on the Intergen form, and John Ayers (I think a develop engineer) initialled for ESA.  I'm off on a day of vacation this am (the Enron kind), so I picked up email early.  Kay 
 The practice has been for someone from Enron familiar with the project (not a lawyer) initials each of the pages for both contracts, inlcuding exhibits. So, we need to make arrangements for that to happen.  Each of GE and ABB do likewise.  So, who is the lucky person for your project?   Kay 
 I would think that the  LOC's for #s 2 and 3 should be for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II, since we will close on those transfers next week.  ckm 
 Attached is the GE override letter to accompany the facility agreements.    I'm trying to figure out the ABB form.  Kay 
 Pete,  I have a question.  Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to be listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?  If so, what amount goes in there?  Will this defeat what we are trying to do in keeping the original price a supposed mystery?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Bodie.  I like Bodie.  Here Bodie, you a goooood booy Bodie.  I'M NOT KIDDING!!!!  I'd go with Bubba, but that's what we call our cat. 
 I just sent my comments to you and Carolyn.  Kay 
 Herman blessed this letter, but I think it needs to pass through your hands also.  Kay 
 Carolyn,  On the insurance, I would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements, $10m in coverage (without aggregate), deductible no greater than $25,000 for which they are responsible.  We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better. Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at closing.  Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table?  Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it. Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the indemnities lasting longer.  I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.  I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the facility agreement.  14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate "or any other third party" on the fifth line.  Defined terms:  "Commercial operations" isn't in the definitions of the turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their somewhere (an EECC specialty).  Please verify.  Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Viola! 
 I haven't seen the originals.  I can send you an email which has the name of the files, but I do need them printed so that the footer appears with the name as opposed to the temp file number.  Thanks!  Kay 
 Suz,  Please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this am (name in footers).  Thanks,  Kay 
 I think you can just include the electronc file and the appropriate person can print it off when they print the Word file with the rest of the contract.  I don't have any better idea than that.  Kay 
 Here's what I have on H-2.  Sorry Pete, I thought I had sent it to you previously.  Kay 
 I never get both of these email addresses right on the same email.  Kay 
 Attached are electronic versions of the final docs for the CA Development transactions. If there are no other comments we will get the Enron signatures.  How many originals are needed?  Noticed was faxed to the Admin Agent this am.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Hi there,  I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals picked up from Lee's office.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Neil left to go hunting this am, Paige leaves for school tomorrow, leaving me, Michael and our new puppy (mid life crisis dog) to our own devices.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow, and Monday is an Enron holiday, so I'm looking forward to some Kay time, working in the yard (weather permitting), watching Oprah, etc. 
 Tough question.  What happens if they don't pay their legal bills?  Won't they have difficulty closing?  We can pay their consulting fee up front. Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.  What is our concern?  They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to, and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable. Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.  I'm sure they've thought of that all ready.  I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.  I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.  Kay 
 Sheila,  Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.  I spoke with Lisa about that yesterday.  Kay 
 Hi Pete,  Please send a copy of the FV break out contracts to Sheila Tweed (Al works for her).  She needs the info this am, and doesn't want to wait until Al gets in.  She would also appreciate a list of the outstanding issues.  I'll talk to you in a bit on the ABB override letter.  I don't think there will be much to it.  Kay 
 Thanks.  Did you have a good one?  Michael was all "cracked up" over the card you sent!!  Kay 
 I had a HUGE lunch (Vincent's), so something  light sounds good.  We could do the usual appetizers at Grotto. 
 Sounds fine to me. 
 So do we have someone to watch the menagerie?  I can probably get out around 600.  I could probably leave sooner, but I wouldn't get anywhere any quicker!  ckm 
 I expect to be out of town Wednesday and Thursday of next week (don't worry, Ben can ALWAYS find me).  I would like to review the stuff before I leave town.  Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look?  Do you guys think we need or should give Intergen the assignment docs and the bills of sale?  Kay 
 I haven't talked to Ozzie today.  When I spoke with him last night, we were arranging to meet in NYC next Wednesday, and I told him we could celebrate there.  ckm 
 Al,  When I asked the question, I was told that the invoices needed to go to Jody.  If there's a desire for the invoices to go elsewhere, it will need to be addressed with Lisa Bills, with Roseann Engeldorf being consulted.   I do not know if the financing documents limit or otherwise specify the handling of invoices.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 One. 
 Please locate Jody Pierce's fax number, and send it to Peter.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The closing dinner for the big financing will be on Feb. 8.  Just thought I'd keep you current!  Love,  Kay 
 Hi Lisa,  Sounds good to me.  We will be sending unsigned docs, with signature pages to be provided later?  Kay 
 It looks like things are moving forward on the Intergen/CA deal.  If we can verify the status of the wires we will want to give notice today.  Fred Mitro is working on this and will give you a call to up date the status.  I have not seen the final numbers to plug into the notices.  Is this information available?   Kay 
 Lisa,  GE is asking for fully executed copies of thedocuments they signed in connection with the TurboPark transaction.  If I can get copies I will be glad to make distribution.  Kay 
 Viola! 
 Hi Ben,  I've given it a quick look. Looks a lot different from when I last saw it.  I don't see a triggering event on the obligations in 2 a.  Was there another fix agreed to by all (maybe the "as required by law" language?)  Also, any idea why the service charge language was deleted in b?  Maybe it isn't a problem.  Also, do you have a copyy of the site plan approval?  Talk to you soon,  Kay 
 fyi 
 I'll hang it up.  Kay 
 I still plan to be out on Friday - guess I should use my discretionary holiday first.  I should be in NYC Wednesday  and Thursday.  I don't need you to do anything in that regard yet.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sounds great.  I'm starving also. 
 Fred,  As we discussed, we need the physical addresses where the equipment in TurboPark is being stored.  As I understand it the equipment is in at least a couple of places, and we haven't advised the banks of that fact.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the guts of the deal. 
 This is a new transaction, so you can put in your two cents worth early!  Kay 
 Here's how I would do it. =20  (llc and its permitted assignees hereinafter referred to as "Optionee"), a= nd=20 ____________________________________, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability,  This is consistent with option.  Revise like this and send out again to=20 Herman.  thanks ckm 
 I'll be forwarding multiple emails containing the Intergen documents. 
 I love Vincent's and it is close, so I say we go for it. 
 Here are the two bills of sale for  the Intergen transaction.  The only change to the form was the insertion of the date.  The CA II bill also reflects the sale of the transformer. 
 Opps.  Didn't mean to leave you out! 
 Attached are assignment and assumption agreements for CA I and CA II.    The only changes to the GE form were those changes suggested by Lisa, and a little clean up.  Kay 
 Well, you must be famous in the I bank bidness, as she claims to know you. 
 I haven't talked to anyone.  I've got 10 docs going out this am, but I'm almost finished. 
 She says you worked together at Chase. 
 I would like to have a chance to read it, which I haven't.  I still finishing up the Intergen docs.  The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to react, which might result in some changes to the contract.  In the case of the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the equipment after assignment.  Kay 
 Sounds good, but if today isn't a good day, it is not a problem. 
 It is too big for Ben.  Maybe Dave Duran? 
 So long as the equipment is held by E-Next, Jody Pierce needs to get the invoices, although copies can be sent elsewhere.  Kay 
 I'm attaching the notices for CA I and CA II.  Please pay particular attention to CA II, since it is the first time it has been circulated. Obviously, we will need to insert the final purchase numbers.  Lisa, I set it up so ENA is consenting, which tracks the language in the DCMA.  Kay 
 Hi Lisa,  I'm back, and will finish up these docs this am.  The notice provision does not require that all the closing documents be completed as of the date of the notice, although I expect to have the package finished anyway, including the CA II documents.  We expect the escrow to be funded today, so as far as I know we will want to give notice today, although it might be later than the am, depending on when the escrow is funded.  Ben, Fred, are you ready for us to give notice?  Kay  PS.  Laurie Mahon says "hello". 
 Please create a duplicate set of documents in my CA Development folder, just changing the name to CA Energy Development II LLC.  I'll need both sets.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's a set of CA I revised docs.  If these are ok, we will get CA II lined up as well.    I'm on the road tomorrow, but should be back in the office on Wednesday am.  Kay 
 Is the notice the only change?  If so, it looks ok to me. 
 I will be travelling to Washington DC tomorrow (Tues) with Mark Bernstein. If we finish up tomorrow, I will travel back to Houston tomorrow night, and will be in the office on Wednesday.  I hope to take this Friday as a vacation day.  Kay 
 I don't understand the last sentence. 
 Will he be there tonight, or shall we go for tomorrow am?  Kay 
 The stuff is being delivered in accordance with the notice provision of the letter agreements, which means the  original goes to "President".  A copy is also being delivered to George, so he would be a good one to make distribution at Intergen.  Kay 
 I had Ozzie sign it, and it has been sent to Carolyn.  Kay 
 Looks to me like notice will be given Wednesday or Thursday.  The changes are being made to the CA I documents now.  Kay 
 You should have also received the original GE agreements and acknowledgement letters.  The transmittal letter has been signed and is being faxed to you and delivered.  Kay 
 I'll  be in DC tomorrow, although my schedule will be tight.  Hey, at least it is a local call!  Kay 
 Looks good.  I'm checking to see who will sign. Have you received the delivery yet? 
 Do you want to print, sign and fax, or shall I take to Janet or someone else to sign?  Kay 
 Please print on letterhead.  Kay 
 When I was at the site it said that it had sent a new password to me at kay.mann@enron.com.  Didn't get here.  I give up. 
 Carolyn,  These should be the correct blacklines to include in the transmittal with the GE facility agreements.  Ben/Fred,  Carolyn and I are coordinating the delivery of the facility agreements to Sweetgum.  Kay 
 Hi Elizabeth,  I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go. When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Suzanne,  I haven't seen a revised flight schedule from TAP.  Have they made the change yet?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Peter,  I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before.  Essentially, it is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by E-Next Generation, but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is assigned to a third party.   We will need something along the same line for the ABB equipment.  If you can send me a redline of the final form of the ABB  facility agreement against the master, we can discuss how to proceed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 The DCMA states in 6.01 that notice can be given by the designee.  Karl thinks the notice must come from the DCM (ENA).  Does it matter? I don't mind ENA giving the notice in this case, but I wanted to see what the team thinks.  Kay 
 I don't remember seeing an agreement, which isn't to say that I haven't. 
 Looks like this needs to be cancelled.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I sneaked in 10 minutes of reading.  The book made me think that we shouldn't let Kaley growl about food.  I'll double check.  How's your day?  Kay 
 Schedule reflects amount due for cancellation on or before the stated dates? 
 I'll put it on your desk. 
 I can't believe we have a puppy.  Everything smells like puppy to me, even though I took a very long shower.  Michael and Pal had a nice visit this morning.  Pal is still whining a bit.  I brought one of our puppy books to the office, and I'll sneak a peak when I can.  I did read about the up at night stuff, and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with you, the whining should stop pretty quickly.  I hope the resting on the chest didn't mess it up, but boy, was I desperate.  He did great using the grass when we got up.  He definitely knows why we go outside.  Kaley picked on him a little, but she was at her food bowl.  I set up the little crate where she can't look in it, so he has an escape.  We should walk the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes.  We probably need to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the electronic fence.  Thanks for taking the pig rat back.  Love,  ckm 
 This goes with the GE contract. 
 Here's the electronic file. 
 Fred,  Is the ABB transformer currently in existence (already delivered)?  Thanks,  Kay 
 How about 1100 am on Monday to discuss the NEXT deal?  It works for John et al.  Kay 
 I'm working like a dog, so it is going quickly... 
 Don't know yet.  I'll decide Monday.  It is hard to get a hotel, so Claude made me one in connection with Heather, who is there on other business. 
 The ABB and GE agreements for CAED were signed by ABB and GE.  There was a revision to the ABB agreement (deleting irrelevant data sheets) that Kathleen Carnahan will send to you.  Thanks for all your work on these.  We are definitely making progress.  Kay 
 My suggestions: 
 I've sent JRigby the execution versions of the break out contract and the override letter.  I've asked him to call me to discuss.  FYI: The turbine contract was originally drafted by Brian Barto, then Kathy Clark took over.  Scott Dieball (EECC Legal) was actively involved in the negotiations, as was I. In facct, it was the first deal I worked on after I transferred to ENA from EECC.  Kay 
 Please call to discuss. 
 Please call todiscuss. 
 No one is signing for CA Development today.  Ben or someone from the commercial team initials, not legal.  I just initial the signature. 
 yes 
 Please send a copy of the ABB facility agreement for CA II to Ben Jacoby and Kathleen Carnahan.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Use this one: 
 This will need to be signed by ABB today.  I would guess 3 originals.    Ben, I suggest we let Kathleen coordinate the assembly of the docs to be signed.  Kay 
 Please prepare for signature.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kara,  I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not understanding it all.  I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a great job of getting the kids prepared.  Thanks for everything, and see you next week!  Kay 
 Sounds good.  Mike will be here in a bit to sign.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm trying to figure out how to have a birthday party in DC or NYC. 
 I can never get both of your email addresses right at the same time. 
 First flight out in the morning to National, I'll check on the return flight.  For now book me on the 500 out of National. 
 Lee,  You should be receiving a package shortly containing the following:  1. Changed pages for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II facility agreements.  These are the same pages that were faxed to you and Kent a few days ago.  I also included a couple of original pages (73, 74, I think) which were missing from one of the originals.  This need to be initialled and executed. 2. Acknowledgement letters for each of CAED I and CAED II which need your Here's the form:  3. Assignment and assumption agreement to move the equipment from TurboPark to the CAED I.  There will be one for CAED II as well.  This document is being reviewed by the bank, so I'm not convinced it is in final form.  You will note that there is an acknowledgement section for GE.  I cut and pasted from the consent to assignment from the TurboPark documents, but shortened the whole thing considerably.  Here's that document:    4.  Signature pages (signed by Enron) from the ESA deal, both the facility agreement and the override letter.  Obviously, we need your signature.   I will forward the final CA facility agreements to you once again, along with the blacklines against what you initialled.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Who's the lucky counterparty? 
 She didn't leave me a voice mail. 
 never received a pass word. 
 I kinda hate to leave the premises since the sitter isn't sitting for us. However, it is supposed to be a beautiful evening, so we can have some adult time on the back patio.  I put a couple of steaks in the fridge.  Love,  ckm 
 Hi.  I'm at home, trying to waiting to visit GE's offices which are at 610 and 290.  Michael has been invited to have pizza with Stephen this evening.  Tommy and Julie are going out, and Stephen has a sitter (Sam won't be there), so he wanted to have a buddy over for pizza.  I told Julie that Michael's calendar is open for this evening.  Hope that is ok for you.  ckm 
 I'm at home this am, as I want to go by GE's offices this am to get some signatures.  Kay 
 Team Turbineb,  Number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements.  We are also trying to get the ABB and GE facility agreements finalized so they can be tendered to Intergen today.  Meanwhile, on the TurboPark front I am revising the relevant documents so the drafts can be sent to the banks today.  Once the assignment and assumption agreement form is approved, it will need to be signed by GE.  This doesn't have to be done today.  We are also trying to get both the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters signed today.  Carolyn, have the escrow agreements been fully executed?  Kay 
 We discussed this with Mike last night.  He is going to get the number for us, as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere.  Kay 
 I've contacted John Keffer and asked them to help.  I will initiate the approval process to get he and Carolyn retained.  Kay 
 John,  Enron owns two GE 7EA turbines, which may be sold in a structure similiar to the CA Development structure.  We would like to update the letter agreements to address this possibility, and would appreciate K & S's assistance in that regard.  The counterparties are not yet known, but I have heard Evista and Cayuga mentioned.  If this sounds good to you, I will initiate the approval process for your retention in this matter.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Sure.  The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows:  instead of a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide ABB with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.  Kay 
 Perfect. 
 Sounds good to me.  We really need to get this amendment signed today.  Please do what you can to expedite.  Thanks,  Kay 
 You might check the letter agreement re escrow and see what it says.  ckm 
 We need to change the alcohol and drug stuff.  Please call me to discuss tomorrow morning - I'll be in after 900.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm trying to get off the phone with you know who.  I'd better meet you downstairs or wherever we are going. 
 Where are we with regard to the escrow agreements and the amendment to the letter agreements?  The latter is especially critical to Enron.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I need to go to DC next Tuesday.  I'll get with you tomorrow.  Kay 
 Yes, please. 
 Way cool. 
 Please email directly, copy to Ben, Fred and me.  Thanks.  I really appreciate all your good work, and will pass that along to David Runnels and Paul Pipitone soon.  Kay 
 Please print two copies, put one in a folder.  Thanks,  Kay 
 ok.  I'll go look at the questions again. 
 Yes, E-Next.  You might advise Jeff that we will probably need a substitute LOC post-assignment.  Kay 
 I'll check to see if he is here tomorrow.  You ought to visit Frank (yes, the TRADING lawyer), Ned, Dan and the rest.  It feels quite international around here.  Kay 
 I'm having trouble with Ben directing outside counsel.  I'm going to discuss it (politely), but I just want you to know what's up.  Kay 
 He's re-trading on the retainage.  Let's discuss.  Kay 
 Please send the docs to me only, and I will talk to Ben.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Ben,  What's up?  Kay 
 fyi 
 For your information and contemplation.  Kay 
 Hi Dale,  Just got  your email re assignment out of TurboPark.  Here are the draft documents being reviewed by the lender for the movement of equipment out of TurboPark.  Kay 
 Wouldn't it be nice to not have a fire drill at the end? At least we will be ready.  I'm can't wait to see what their lenders will come up with.  Ben's hoping it will fall through and he can sell these again, I think.  Kay 
 Lisa,  Thanks.  I forwarded Roger the docs separately, but thanks for the reminder. I am capable of forgetting!  Kay 
 Hi Jeffrey,  I'm not handling change orders for the individual projects.  I'm checking with Stuart (he's the COA deal  lawyer) to get a consensus on the best way to handle this.  Kay 
 FYI 
 The ABB breakout contract and the GE breakout contract are just about done. I'm not volunteering for change order duty.  Do you think this is a good Roger task? 
 Are we ready to sign these today?  How many originals do we need?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Even more current... 
 Hi Brett,  We haven't been able to locate it.  Could you resend?  Where should I send your set of docs?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Works for us. 
 Thanks.  Did I tell you that I spoke with GE about the assignment, and their initial response was very positive.  NorthWestern is predicting closing in July.  Kay 
 They still have to fund at the same time. 
 Hi there,  Thanks for taking my car in.  I admit I feel like men get treated better by car servicing people than women.  I'm not just saying that, either.  On the issue of Charlotte, is it your idea that she will take care of Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?  I know in her email she had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a regular basis.  I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience for you...  ckm 
 Rose,  Have you seen the signature pages?  We need the agreements and the override letter.  Kay 
 Looks like your stuff. 
 Brett wiggs tells me that he faxed me signature pages last week.  He is with Enron South America.  Did you see anything?  Kay 
 I won't do anything about this until you reach a consensus.  Kay 
 For your review. 
 This is a deal that will close soon.  Please print and put these in a file folder.  There will be other docs coming.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Per Lisa's request please find a revised notice:    Kay 
 Here's a conformed version: 
 Hi there,  I would like to have one email with electronic versions of the letter agreement, and all the attachments except the turbine contract.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Pete,  I'm getting comments that people are having trouble opening the ABB docs. Please send the docs directly to:  david.onunscheck@us.abb.com and michael.o. sandridge@us.abb.com, and fred.mitro@enron.com.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I'm checking. 
 Any interest in extending it to Jan 22? 
 For your review: 
 I'm proof reading now.  I need a sanity check.  Does the GE acknowledgement look goofy?  Maybe I should set it up in a separate letter.  I lifted the language from the consent.  ckm 
 It happens to all of us!  I still have a bizillion roses in my yard.  I love them, and I don't baby them.  I figure if they die, I replace them, since they aren't that expensive.  I would love to include my friend Carlos Sole from EECC for my birthday lunch.  Kay 
 Lisa,  The previous draft of the notice just mentioned the assignment and assumption agreement, so I went generic with closing docs.  Happy to list them individually, however.  I live off of lists.  Kay 
 I don't want to be the one that blows it, so I'm glad to keep you in the loop. 
 Sounds good.  I prefer to keep it kind of small, if that's ok with you.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI (note the closing list).  Kay 
 When do you want to go?  The weather should be getting nice later this week, and I need to gush about the IAOC.  Kay 
 Hi Mark,  I thought I would forward this to you for your information, since Dave may be getting involved.  Kay 
 Sounds promising. 
 This could become interesting if it holds up.  Kay 
 fyi 
 It is amazing what I find if I check my email.  Disregard the request for escrow agreements!  Kay 
 Please print. 
 Opps.  We do have to pay for the account.  I was afraid we were going to send the big hunk of dough! 
 I prefer the weekend.  It gives us a reason to get in and get out.  ckm 
 Sorry about the serial emails.  I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.  Please prepare a closing list.  Between this and the financing side, I'm chasing quite a few documents.  I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to know we have the amendment finished.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please print all attachments and make a folder:  Tolling (Enron tolling).  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please email me the execution version of the escrow agreement.  Are we using one, two or three?  Thanks,  Kay 
 WHOA.  We are not wiring money, we are receiving money.  This should occur either Jan 12 or 15.  Minor detail.  Kay 
 Any response on the amendment to the letter agreements? 
 I think it is two separate documents, one for each purchaser (CAED I and CAED II).  ckm 
 Si. Oui.  Yep. 
 You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you want to skip it?  We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun to do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go for a visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.  Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's guide one of these days.  ckm 
 I went to Sheila's meeting.  Barbara and Jeff were there also.  Hmm.  Don't know about the faxed signature.  Feel free to call Carolyn Campbell at King & Spalding and ask. 713 276 7307. Find out about faxed signature, and whether tomorrow is too late.  We need the escrow account in place by FRIDAY.  Is Mike Miller in? Ozzie would be fine, I guess.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Lee,  The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.  Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.  Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?  Kay 
 I need LJM.  Someone in Global Finance has offered to help with that.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Absolutely.  Kay 
 I've been told by Global Finance that this is how TurboPark stuff gets invoiced.  I'm thinking it might help if copies are sent to project people. What do you think?  Kay 
 I haven't seen it come back.  I spoke with Lynn around Christmas, and he said the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last week.  I'll be glad to follow up.   I was out last week and just haven't worked to that point on my "to do" list.  NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 Hi Roger,  We are going forward with the first deal to move stuff out of TurboPark.  I don't know if you want to see these types of documents, but what the heck, here it is!  Kay 
 Hi Brett,  I haven't seen the fax yet.  I'll check around.  Maybe it got stuck in the wrong pile.  Kay 
 Please do.  Give Lil a big ol hug for me.  I miss her!  Did you hear that Carlos is joining us?  I don't think he has told John S.= =20 yet.  Kay 
 Fred,  I forwarded you the notice prepared by Global Finance.  It requires essentially the same information.  Kay 
 E-Next Generation LLC Mr. Jody Pierce 1400 Smith, EB 2480 Houston, Tx 77002 
 Hi guys,  I'm faxing you some changed pages as requested for the CA Development deal. For some reason my email wouldn't go through.  I should have an answer to the invoice question tomorrow.  If all else fails you can send the invoices to Ben and we can process them here.  Kay 
 Looks good to me.  George left me a message looking for an update.  If you talk to him, would you let him know that I sent the invoicing language to GE, but my contact wasn't in the office.  I expect to hear from them soon.  Kay 
 Not a word. 
 Hi guys,  Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.  Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.  If we don't get an immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can process them here.  I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.  By the way, I haven't given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last met.  Kay 
 Hi there, and happy new year.  I have a stack of turbine contracts which were waiting for signature.  I believe the override letter needed signing as well.  Should I send the unsigned originals somewhere?  Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi.  I haven't checked yet. 
 KC,  Do you know if the books are done, or are the papers in a stack? I don't wa= nt=20 to make extra work.  Thanks,  Kay 
 They need to have their partner sign a confidentiality agreement, or at least we need to add language that they won't disclose it to them without having them sign a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as this one.  Kay 
 GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.  I don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and  I didn't see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.  Any problem with Ben receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?  Thanks,  Kay 
 What would we have on the LLC's?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Matt,  Do CA Energy Development I and II have federal EIN's?  Thanks,  Kay  PS to all, my answers to other questions:  Carolyn has corp documents Not registered to do business in Texas 
 How depressing would it be to be at EECC? 
 fyi 
 A small change... 
 Hi again,  I'm looking for the language regarding invoicing which was requested last week.  I want to address it with GE today.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Thanks.  Suzanne just gave me the documents.  I like having the electronic versions as well.  I can't believe it feels so good to be back.  I must be crazy.  Kay 
 Please print and put in binder.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good morning.  I didn't wake Paige up this am.  I told Michael he could wake her up when he wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.  It feels good to be back.  Last week really wasn't a very good week to take off, and I was really stressed. It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two weeks!  I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.  Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?  Love,  Kay 
 We've handled the notices on  a project specific basis.  Kay 
 Glad I gave you such a GLOWING review. 
 Happy New Year!  I'm available all day except 200-330.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  Please email me the execution version of the documents signed last week, as well as the current version of the other documents.  Were the originals put in the mail?  My assistant isn't here, so I can't tell what I have yet.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Carolyn,  Please forward all original documents to me.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Kathleen,  Let's discuss this sometime this am.  Kay 
 I don't have any language like that on hand.  I suspect it will be in great demand!  Have a great holiday,  Kay 
 Here's the draft of the facility agreement that ABB has had to review, along with a memo for AK about certain questions.  Kay 
 This is an exhibit to the CA agreements. 
 Carolyn,  I wasn't sure you had the last version.  This is the version agreed to by GE, which should be attached to the letter agreement.   I will email an exhibit which needs to be inserted. 
 The other deal I did with TECO  had the same inhouse lawyer.  He's just fine.  ckm 
 Hi George,  I'm looking for the GE acknowledgement letter which we need for this deal. Can you email it to me?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Please include pthompson@akllp.com and ccobb@akllp.com on the email with dial in instructions.  thanks,  Kay 
  Carlos,  Please email the document to me when it is done.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Kathleen,  I will initial and leave these in my office in a file folder with your name. Carlos has my proxy on the consent.  I'm also leaving you with a couple of original CA's for Fred.  He was going to email them to the other side for comment, so HANG ON to the pages I signed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Pete,  We may have a conference call with ABB on Wednesday.  Would you or Chris be able to call in?  Thanks,  Kay  THANKS and Merry Christmas! 
 Great.  GE and Brett's rep (John Ayres) are initially the pages now.  If we can get the signature page right, we can get it over with!!!!!   YIPPEEE   YIPPPEEE YIPPEEE!!!!!! 
 I've volunteered Kathleen to help process the paper.  ckm 
 Ben is trying to set up a conference call with ABB for next Wednesday. Dale, are you available?  Pete Thompson is on vacation next week, but I suspect he would be glad to call in.  Kay 
 Sorry, but I don't know.  Probably in the next 3 hours.  Maybe Jeff will be around.  I have this feeling that I will be turning off the lights tonight.  Kay 
 Please take the form of the Cayuga confid agreement, and substitute this name.  This is CA day!  Kay 
 I'm working on a deal today where we are trying to get to definitive docs. It may require a DASH.  Mark tells me you two have his proxy, so I want to let you know that I may be searching  for you later.  Kay 
 I'm looking for the eggnog.  Skip the gummis, I'll take rum! 
 Lee Johnson is coming in today to sign off on the turbine contract.  Is ESA ready to go with this one?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Carlos,  Could you tell me which of the 4 documents to print, etc?  Unfortunately I have about 10 things getting signed today and I'm perplexed with what I need to do here and I  can't these to figure out.  Which one are you printing/signing?  Thanks,  Kay 
 don't want you to feel left out 
 Please print. 
 Geez. 
 They all have it now. I thought you would enjoy this one.  Did you hear about the protest in Enron's Chicago office.  40 ACORN members stormed in, demanding that Gregg Penman fax a letter to Ken Lay.  No kidding.  ckm 
 Per Carolyn's request. 
 Per Carolyn's request. 
 No one has said anything to me about closing next week.  Lee Johnson is on vacation next week also, so GE won't be around.  Kay 
 Please accept changes and print two execution copies.  Thanks.  Kay 
 I've had to do multiple CA's this week.  I MISS YOU!!! Hope you had a great holiday.  Kay 
 As you predicted. 
 EECC may have this.  Can you check with whoever your team is working with, or do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement?  Kay 
 I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third party escrow arrangement.  Kay 
 For your information/approval.  Kay 
 Mark,  How do you feel about their changes?  Note that we MUST mark everything confidential and they don't want to agree to the non-circumvent.  Kay 
 More fun for your file. 
 I know you were anxiously awaiting these documents.  Kay 
 no Ben 
 I had the call anyway with Mike and Steve.  We actually made progress in outlining the issues.  Mike should be generating an email.  We voted to take next week off. Hope that's ok.  Kay 
 Not really.  It was a format agreed to for all the LM's because the intent in most cases is to sell the project (and the equipment), and the terms in the override letter only apply when the equipment is in the financing structure.  Kay 
 I'll be in a meeting at Keffer's office for the foreseeable future.  I'll turn on my cell phone when I leave the office.  ckm 
 Jim,  We are meeting with them at 230 cst to see if we can reach final agreement.  Kay 
 Guess we need to make the final decision. 
 Placeholder. 
 How about notices going to CA Development, "care of" this contact.  CA doesn't have any employees. 
 otherwise known as CA Development I and CA Development II 
 I suggest taking out contact information and say that Purchaser will notify Seller in writing on or before January 15, 2001 as to the name/fax of the contact.  Kay 
 You won't get me to bet on this one. 
 Did they have anything later than 900? 
 fyi 
 Brett,  I think Friday is perfect.  I will confirm which is the final version, and send to you and John.  Kay 
 Hi Janet,  The attachment at the bottom is the LLC agreement.  Kay 
 I'm no oracle, but there would be no current balance sheet impact. 
 check out q and a #2 below. 
 The attachment at the bottom is the turbine letter.  Kay 
 First installment of finance comments. 
 I'm trying to clean up after Blue Girl.  Can you tell me again who signs for LJM so that I can get signature?  Who does their legal work?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Carlos,  Could you please get Dick to sign this?  Can he sign for NEPCO also?  Two original sigs is enough.  Thanks,  Kay 
 For the purposes of completing the facility agreement, we need the name/address of the contact person for invoices, etc.  Thanks,  kay 
 RE: Notice letter.  We sent out a notice letter to GE last Friday regarding closing of a financing.  Could you print me a hard copy so I can show you what changes need to be made?  We need to send out another letter this week.  Kay 
 I have a 130 closing at King & Spalding tomorrow.  I also have a 1015 meeting with Lisa Bills, her office.  thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Matt,  Here's the InterGen deal (formerly the Coral deal, now with new counterparty).  We plan to meet with them tomorrow to see if we can wrap up the agreements.  Any comments?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Per your request. 
 Can someone in your office (or the Houston office) put together the execution copies of this agreement?  We will need three originals.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Here's the first draft re the deal which needs structuring help:   Please let me know when you are available to meet on this.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Pete,  Please call me after you have reviewed this.  Kay 
 Gentlemen,  This is now back to being the CA Development I and II deal.  Please change the name.  Please send it to me and Lee Johnson tomorrow, if possible.  Kay 
 Here tis. 
 I don't believe Ben agreed to absolutely free transferablity on their part. To ponder. 
 Latest docs. 
 Boyd,  I would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing.  I also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses.  Kay 
 Can't hurt! 
 I presume you haven't heard anything or else you would have said something. I haven't heard a word... 
 Did Sheila want Scott to participate?  Looks like the call will be too late for him. 
 Hi John,  I took very poor notes from your phone call.  Did you want to see a form of LOI?  For what type of transaction?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant Tom Knudson  May. 16, 2001 Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM)  Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and research."  Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development.  Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.  So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on the marine environment.  Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.  Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:  $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of seawater.  $425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean.  $1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project.  $100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property.  $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.  $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing.  $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to maintain the trail.  "It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.  "These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the attorneys," said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board. "We could have been much more successful with their help. But there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."  Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate.  "Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources on line.  The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy expansion plan.  No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.  Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey Bay.  "Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a penny comes to me."  Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people.  "It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort level."  The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than $12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization.  The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to "mitigate" environmental impacts of the plant.  Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote "the wise use and conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands," its Web site says. However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is inadequate.  "If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board for the price of mitigation," Chabot said. "The agencies got bought off cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."  Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation "must be based on science, not on buying anybody off," he said. "That is inappropriate, and we would not participate in that.  "That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any environmentalist."  Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. "We are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem," he said.  Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the recipients of Duke's payments a "shopping list" of government agencies, environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.  "You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem with that."  Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased from PG&E in 1998.  If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.  "This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of California."  Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate water.  "Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead," said Steve Shimek, executive director of the Otter Project.  For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plant's impact on the environment.  "There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment," said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our Shores. "We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."  Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.  The process "gave me tremendous pause and great concern," Nichols said. "I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing."  She was right.  "As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods," said Clark, of the citizens group.  Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.  Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison between the two offers, calling it "grossly unfair and inaccurate."  Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain the process. "It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical," she said.  Shimek took a different view. "We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to haunt them," he said.  "Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we did." 
 So  true so true so true. 
 900 am this am.  For your info.  Crazy day. 
 FYI. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 The  name is in the draft agreements I forwarded.  Maybe Fred can find out from the commercial people where the main office  is located. 
 We are waiting to hear.  We have received documents from them, but no definitive word.  Kay 
 I suspect we will need a D & B on the Sweetgum entity being proposed by the new counterparty. 
 Please print attachments.  Thanks,  Kay 
 De nada. 
 thanks 
 The assignment and assumption document has been signed by ENA and is being hand-delivered to Rose Engeldorf.  Kay 
 I believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding.  Will closing and funding take place tomorrow, or will funding be a day later?  Kay 
 I will initial and handle signature. 
 Please send out an email reminding folks of the GE conference call tomorrow.  Thanks,  Kay  Mike, Scott, Steve, Sheila, Rose, Ben, Kent, Lisa 
 Hi Heather,  Hope you got situated in your new, swanky spot.  Can't wait to see what you've done with it.  I'm attaching Paige's resume, since she is interested in a summer internship.  Any help you can give in directing it to the right person would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Rose,  FYI.  I wasn't sure you had this.  Kay 
 Thanks.  I rsvp'd.  ckm 
 Hey, they are making me crazy and I'm just reading your emails.  Kay 
 I know Ben wants us to substitute the one signed by the other guy.  I'll take care of it. 
 calendar, please 
 Planning on it.  Free food... 
 Thanks,  Kay 
 fyi 
 It is basically the same. 
 I'm in today. 
 I will be there! 
 Question:  Do we have a schedule of assets to be involved in the transaction?  I recall that Janelle had some stuff that wasn't on the list.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Michael is sick with some nasty virus.  I'm a bit afraid to commit until he starts looking better.  Poor kid had strep last week.  Maybe he'll perk up by Thursday, but the doctor says it is a 10 day ordeal. I bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it.  Kay 
 Dale tells me that he really needs ABB to get with it.  I sent an email (yet another) to ABB's lawyer asking for comments.  Kay 
 After 2 parties, I'm getting party burn out.  How bad is that?  Kay 
 Hi Dave,  I was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility agreement? We would like to make some progress on the form this week.  In fact, you may hear (or have heard) directly from Dale Rasmussen, who is an Enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue.  There are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in words and made a part of the individual facility agreements, or integrated as changes to these agreements.  Thanks for your assistance,  Kay 
 I've heard of some of the stuff.  These items should be dealt with in the facility agreements for the individual projects.  ABB has had a form  of this agreement to comment on for a while, but we haven't heard anything.  Hope this helps a little.  Kay 
 Looks ok to me. 
 This may sound like a silly question, but why?  Is this something Ben wants Matt doing?  1-4 are all the CO's I know about.  I'm out today, but we can discuss it tomorrow, and I can explain my point of view.  Kay 
 It won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact ABB's lawyer directly. His name is Dave Onuscheck, and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com.  I'm home with a sick kid, and I don't have his telephone number with me.  Peter Thompson has worked on the form.  Do you have the draft with the memo of issues?  Kay 
 I haven't tried yet.  Things are ok.  Michael is mad because I won't let him open a present. 
 Lee,  If this will be a dual fuel unit, it seems we should at least have a place holder guarantee, even if the details aren't included.  Any problem with that approach?  Kay 
 I'm at home with a sick child today, but should be in the rest of the week. 
 Not exactly a "yes, we can close on Wednesday". 
 The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain issues with Westinhouse relating to the Gleason and Wheatland projects.  It also reflects that Enron isn't going to go after SWPC for a return of an option payment for the Blue Girl equipment.  SWPC has requested that everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack. Please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature for your respective groups.  I'll handle the LJM and ENA signatures.  Please call if you have any questions.  Kay 
 Al,  Each project must have its own break out contract - that's the deal struck with GE and with the lenders.  There will be no change orders to the master contract relating to specific projects.  The break out contract must be entered into "as soon as practicable". This appproach has been taken with Austin, LV Co Gen, and ESA, and all of those contracts are just about finished.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Sheila also has a good understanding of the structure.  Kay 
 Is it foggy or raining?  I can't see anything out my window. 
 ok 
 Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430, she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.  Should I just leave him after gymnastics?  I don't really want to come back the office, but I do want to go to Anne's.  Hmmm.  If Paige is home by 500, everything might work. 
 Barbara/Jeff:  In the  TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.  I know some (but not all) of it.  I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.  Maybe after the first of the year those group members who will be working on the power origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and accounting folks.  Kay 
 More:  We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included as an exhibit.  What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Things are getting better since TurboPark closed.... 
 You'll be delighted to know that the call has moved to 1000 your time, noon central.  Kay 
 fyi 
 Scott,  I'm handling outside counsel, and spoke with him this week.  I'm prepared to give legal advice on the issue. 
 How about a conference call at 1100 (Central) time?  Kay 
 Michael has some stuff at school today that I would like to attend.  I hope to leave here around 130.  Kay 
 Hi Carolyn,  In order to discourage Ben from continuing to direct outside counsel, please address as much correspondence as possible to me, or to me and him.  Ben is terrible (and shameless) about violating Enron policy in this regard, and I don't know that I can stop him, but I do need your assistance in curbing him as much as possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Peter, the distribution list on this is different from the ESA deal (each contract has a different list - isn't that special?)  I will forward it to the correct people.  Lee Johnson and Kent Shoemaker get copies on all of them from GE's side.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Who will/can sign the turbine contract for Enron?  Thanks,  Kay 
 My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was one of her lawyers' deals, but "things just weren't getting done".  She can be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on "your" deal, then tell you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use. This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and she is very, very nice.  I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion.  Kay  PS.  I thought this time I would give you full disclosure... 
 Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and assumption agreement.  The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened until there is a certainty of closing.  A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this transaction.  We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark transaction.    I'll make the changes.  Hope this information is helpful.  Kay 
 No.  Why is Rebecca Walker telling Cheryl how to do this? 
 Please print. 
 Here's the latest... 
 Per Rose's instructions.  Kay 
 FYI:  The champagne is flowing in New York, as TurboPark closed moments after GE agreed to revise their consent to meet WestLB's last request.  Kay 
 Next week is Twas the Night Before Christmas. 
 Looks like 230 today is good for all three of us re: option issues.  We will meet in Herman's office on 33.  Kay 
 NRG Thermal and Millenium Energy are the parties.  More specific names to come. 
 I forgot about the happy hour.  Where is it?  I think that carpool could be pretty hectic, and since you and I haven't picked him up we don't know the drill.  Picking him up an  hour later might be a lot easier, and it doesn't bother him.  Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities?  Kay 
    Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK  By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel?????? Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000  ???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here. ???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and east of Florida's Turnpike. ???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on Tuesday. ???"While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose," City Manager C.

 I've redlined the document against the previous version, but I don't think I picked up all the changes.  In addition to the marked changes, there are these changes:  D.  third line, added "Original" before LM6000.  This change is made throughout the document. D. pentultimate line, replaced EECC with ENA. Dated everything December 15; added "with respect to the Subject LM6000 Turbines after "Original Turbine Contract" throughout E.  Added "and" between rights obligations in (iii) 2 (c) Added the Pastoria One-Train Turbine Contract in (ii) and (iii).    Kay 
 fyi  No action required. 
 Oh my gosh that is so sweet!  You caught me by surprise! 
 This  letter is the last  part of the contract: 
 2 of 2 
 Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality. 
 Hi Greg,  The agreement isn't  attached.  (I do that ALL the time.)  ckm 
 1 of 2 
 Dick,  I'll forward you the copy of the contract on a separate email.  I do not know if there are any additional insurance requirements specified by the lenders.  Kay 
 How's Hop-a-long? 
 Hi Dave,  I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that) yesterday.  The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled transformers ($400 off).  With your permission I will substitute the correct version so ABB gets the money.  Thanks,  Kay 
 This is the language in front of GE. I am optimistic that they will agree to this language.  Kay 
 It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC, don't you think?  Kay 
 I need the  phone number for Tom Heatherington (sp?) at Bracewell in Houston. Someone should have a directory.  Kay 
 This language is different that what GE was told was requested before.  I am more comfortable going back to GE with what was requested previously.  Kay 
 Didn't really deal with her. 
 If you look under my kmann directory you will find a doc called westinghouseproposal to resolve issues on Enron Dec13 SWPC.  Please print 4 originals on ENA letterhead.  Thanks,  Kay 
 At Mark Bernstein's request I am forwarding a confidentiality agreement for your review.  If it meets with your approval, please sign and fax back to me at 713-646-3491.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713 345 7566.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Good, I didn't want to ask Ed.  He's very busy.    So which curse word did you use? 
 Can you get me a draft by Friday am?  Thanks,  Kay 
 OK. 
 But I want you to be in the same group as me so we can work together again!  ckm 
 The end is in sight!  The break out contracts for the TurboPark LM's need to be finished up (not news to anyone).  Each of these agreements will be between GE and E-Next Generation LLC (DevCo) and GE, unless the project company is already owned by DevCo.  I suggest that each agreement reference be the same as the original, with an adder which makes it clear which project it belongs to (LVCG, FV, CISO1 and CISO2, for example).  Al, your contract needs to be fixed up.  Please contact Pete Thompson at AK in DC to get it rolling, if you haven't all ready. 212 662 2780  Pete, the CA Development agreements should now be in the name of E-Next Generation LLC.  For indentification purposes we can call the contracts CISO1 and CISO2.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Very minor crisis.  A penny for your thoughts...  Kay 
 These documents do not go to a third party purchaser.  For instance, they do not get the change orders or correspondence relating ot all of  the turbines.  What needs to be pulled together are the technical documents, and any project type correspondence relating to the units being sold.  Kay 
 Hi Sheila,  Did you ever come across the retention letter for PMRW reflecting a fee discount?  Who would have that?  Thanks,  Kay 
 Don't know the answers. We need to visit with Herman Manis to get his buy-in on an approach.  I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll ask.  Are you in Houston today?  ckm 
 Yes, whichever. 
 Yes. 
 I had a really big lunch, even cake, so now eating out of the fridge (if at all) sounds ok.  I got a really nice bottle of white wine from Andrews & Kurth.  I put it by the window to cool off.  I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S, and they are really good. However, K & S represents American Express.  Keffer tells me that you used a guy at Bracewell that you liked, and that this person has now started their own firm.  John drew a blank on the name, but will call me back with the name and number.  Enron also likes Gibbs & Bruin, a litigation boutique in Houston. I believe the main contact's name is Robin Gibbs, but that is also the name of one of the Bee Gee's, so I could be wrong.  Can you check the internet and see?  If not, I will look in a minute.  Love,  Kay 
 I need to finish up an agreement and have it sent to a man by the name of John "Steinbow". Please call him and get the correct spelling of his name, his address and his fax number.  If he (or his assistant) needs an explanation, I need the info to complete an agreement requested by Mark Bernstein.  (Mark doesn't have the info, but doesn't want John to know he doesn't have it, so please don't call Mark to ask.)  Steinbow's number is 914 697 2418.  Thanks!  Kay 
 FYI. 
 Good morning!  I'm soliciting commitments for those wanting to go to the Nutcracker this year.  I was thinking of trying to get tickets to a daytime performance.  Any interest?  The Sugar Plum Fairy 
 Hi there,  Just a note to say hello.  Hello.  Nit Noi sounds good to me tonight, if we don't eat out of the fridge.  I'm having a craving for ethnic food.  Love,  Kay

 Way cool.  I'd let Reagan follow up.  ckm 
 Good.  I'm ready to get at least one thing off the "to do" list.  Kay    Enron North America Corp. 
 We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.  I hope Carolyn told you I called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.  I'm guessing it is in a coma.  I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!  Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can.  By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on the HSR on TurboPark?  We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more available?  I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.  However, he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?  Ciao,  Kay 
 I'm home today (Michael has strep again), but I will check email and you can call me at home.  This is a good start!  Bear with AR, and call me about Barbara.  Sheila knows all she needs to know.  ckm   ps YIPPPEEE!!!! 
 Dave Onuscheck left me a voice mail message that Frank had not yet reviewed the change order. Dave predicted it would be tomorrow am.  That's getting close., but if it is done by then we probably won't be subjected to bodily harm.  Kay 
 I used to work at EECC, so I know that noone controls that group!  There is a place in the agreement for a contract number.  I think we ought to use the same contract number as before, but add a distinguishing number or letter- like FV or LVCG.  How does that sound?  Kay 
 Have I received a fax from ABB? 
 I haven't heard anything so far, although I need to check my voice mail again.  Kay 
 In fairness to Pete, we have him working on ALL the GE and ABB break out agreements at once.  I'm going to be reviewing the ESA agreement, which is priority one because of financing requirements.  This will be my final review of the "form" break out contract.  We have not had a tax, insurance, accounting or finance review of the form for ENA, and with TurborPark closing this week it may be difficult to have completed within the next 24 hours.  However, I don't expect any big issues, since it is so close to the original form. That being said, from the EPC contractor's standpoint, it is so close to being done that there shouldn't be any big issues.  Just thought I'd mention all the pieces which are still coming together.  Kay  PS.  Dale, does the LV Co Gen project involve a lease (a/k/a Enron getting off take)?  h 
 Okey dokey. 
 Ta da.  I thought this seemed like a good way to handle it.  ckm 
 Lisa is a real hoot. Smart, tough as nails.  She pulls no punches.  Michael seems to feel better, but he has terrible circle under this eyes. I'm going to insist that the doctor give him 3 rounds of antibiotics.  Being a boy, it isn't so bad.  I just  know that the strep is hiding in his sinuses, so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again.  He slept until 800 today, and hour and a half later than usual.  I think that must be his body healing.  He is so excited that 6 flakes of snow might fall tonight.  Paige wrote me today, said she is freezing (she's north of Austin).  Kay 
 It is my understanding tha twelve LM 6000 turbines will go into E Next.  The ESA and City of Austin LM's are the only ones not making the trip.  Kay 
 The original GE West LB agreement, please.  I suggest that you contact Lee Johnson via email, copying his lawyer Kent Shoemaker, asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee.  Kay 
 Hi Dave,  I wanted to check in to see how we are coming with the change order.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Suzanne,  On my desk (on the window side) you will find a bound volume of a contract for 24 turbine generator sets (between GE and a bank with a long name). Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.  Peter, could you please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.  Pete, this will give you a full set of exhibits, since you don't have everything.  Suz, you don't have to make a copy, as I believe that copy to be an extra. If we need a copy Pete can send us a copy later.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I wasn't clear if the new B-1 is supposed to supplement or replace the old B-1.  It is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent. That gets a bit more technical than what I'm capable of judging.  You might want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there.  Kay 
 I like that idea.  Do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look like?  I don't have the agreement with me (see below).  At last word the Coral deal was sidelined.  More to come.  I'm at home with a sick child today.  When you have a redlined version of the ESA stuff (redlined against the master), please email it to my assistant, Suzanne Adams, so she can print it and have it delivered to my house.  If it is being printed by AK in Houston, please have it delivered to my house at 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Hi Suz,  Please print the exhibits and fax to me it home.  I thought you might enjoy this one.  Kay 
 This shows the additional amount related to the Fountain Valley change order, formerly known as Change Order #6.  Hope this helps.  Kay 
 Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage. If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.  Kay  PS.  Feel like Alice in Wonderland  yet? 
 I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are plugging things into the text of the document.  I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel guarantees, and where these will be reflected.  Kay 
 I changed the 2nd paragraph so that ABB is receiving money, not paying it. 
 Hi Dave,  I revised the change order to segregate the signature page.    Thanks,  Kay 
 Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question came from.  Will we have an exhibit U?  I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.  Kay 
 We have deleted Exhibit U from the break out contracts. In other words, the version they received has been superceded. I'll have to see what I can figure out about where the old reference came from. 
 If all else fails we will just make copies from the other agreement. 
 I didn't think about the champagne.  Nice touch.  I like Wick Fowler's - really easy, very tasty.  I just may have to have some.  I don't mind a few days of cold weather.  It kills the fleas and the skeeters. 
 I plan to be there. 
 Hi Sheila,  I'm not up on this part of the deal.  ckm 
 I'm thinking this is a good one to ignore. 
 Hi.  Did the CA get signed and sent, and did it come back?  Thanks,  Kay 
 It was a compliment! 
 The ground should be warm enough to keep anything from sticking.  We got a half a cord of wood this weekend, and chili fixin's.  YUM. 
 fyi 
 You are difficult to keep up with! 
 Michael is sick, so he's at home, and taking him to the doctor.  More strep. My baby had 103 temperature last night.  He was so pathetic.  I will probably stay home tomorrow.  Kay 
 You are in charge of your own destiny.  Kay 
 Lee (and others),  Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless there is some reason to handle it otherwise.  Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you have more copies of that document that we can attach?  Kay 
 fyi 
 Gentlemen,  Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need the site specific stuff for this project.  Kay
