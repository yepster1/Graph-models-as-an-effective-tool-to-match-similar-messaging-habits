 Jim, I am not sure who handled the operating permits.  I think that type of stuff was usually handled by someone in the gas pipeline group. 
 Cindy,  Attached is the revised confirm with my changes redlined.  Let me know if this covers Nelson's concerns. 
 Please see attached.  Thanks in advance. 
 Sorry to bug you, but I have one more. 
 Kay,  Please see the attached.  I also forwarded a Data sheet earlier on Marathon Oil.  Have you had a chance to review yet? 
 Please see attached.  Thanks. 
  Kay, Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see the attached. 
 Sorry about the delay.  I have just been covered up.  Here it is. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is the executable form of the guaranty.  Please fill in the Cargill information and forward to Bridgeline for execution.  Also, I didn't know what the effective date should be.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Enfolio Master for the Ocean transaction.  The redline reflects the changes from the original draft.  Also attached is a clean version of the Transaction Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Ocean for their review. 
 Jeff,  Attached is the redline from your earlier revisions. 
 Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues. 
 Russell,  The data you requested last week concerning the motor is as follows:  1.  Full Load MVA rating:  11.4 for each unit 2.  Across the line starting MVA:  43.8 for each unit 3.  Input Voltage:  12 KVA 
 Hey Walter,  Thanks for stopping and leaving the note.  I'm glad I got to know you at the happy hours.  We will have to schedule another Gallant Knight evening sometime soon.  Good luck to you as well.  Take care. 
 I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip? 
  I am fine with the change.  Mary, please prepare executables and make the change in the NUI document as well. 
 GT,  I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.  My friend who was going to go back out.  It is yours if you want to use it.  Let me know. 
    GT,  I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.  My friend who was going to go back out.  It is yours if you want to use it.  Let me know. 
  The contracts for the notice letters. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:  1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap. 2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.  I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.  Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration. 
 FYI 
 Rudwell,  Attached is the guaranty with my comments redlined.  Please review and forward.  If you have any questions, please call me at x-33512. 
 Attached is the Burlington guaranty with my comments.  I was unable to redline the doc.  Computer problems.  I am forwarding the clean version.  Hopefully Burlington can redline against the draft they sent. 
 Ned,  I am fine with all of their changes.  Attached is a clean version reflects their changes.  Ask them to print out two copies and execute. 
 Frank,  Attached for your review is a draft of the settlement agreement we discussed. 
 Attached is the letter.  The address information and Unocal's full name need to be inserted and then print two copies on ENA letterhead for execution. 
 I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further. 
 Frank,  Attached is the letter with the revised Section 2.  I also added some language to the beginning of Section 5 to make it clear how that Section operates with Section 2. 
 David,  Attached is the document with the insurance mark-ups that I noted on my voice mail.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Extension of Kennedy Wyoming Gas Purchase. FYI 
 Frank, I made a few tweaks.  Please review. 
 Gary,  Can you give me a scope of the issues we need to address in this CA.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the some of amendment info we discussed last week.  Looks like they want to get this out this week. 
 It will be in 38C1 beginning at 11 am CT tommorrow. 
 Per Gary Bryan's request, attached is a Confidentiality Agreement form for your review. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare CA for the following entities.  Black Diamond should be bi-lateral and Shell needs to be unilateral (i.e. only protects us).  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Shane,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted Carlos Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp." is a note which should be stricken.  Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  Lastly,  the full legal name "Enron North America Corp." should be inserted in the agreement.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 New deal being negotiated. 
 Attached is the form of GTC Wellhead for use in the Torch Energy transaction. 
 Rakhi,  Attached is the letter with my revisions.  I would have Mr. Neyman sign the letter.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Our insurance contact is David Marshall.  His phone number is 713 853-6847. 
 Judy,  I added the language for the payment by wire transfer in Section 6. 
 Attached is your proposed language with my comments redlined.  Please review.  I would be happy to discuss.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 FYI,  We have one more outstanding issue.  I have given them our insurance expert (David Marshall) name so they can discuss their insurance comments directly. 
   Phil,  Can you send Tyrell the schedule that is to be attached as Appendix A? 
 Attached are the revisions I sent to John. 
 FYI,  New Huber deal being negotiated. 
 Debra,  Could you resend to Enfolio Spot Master to Mark?  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss.  Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?  Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal. 
 Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.  Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.  Some items to note:  1.  As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at Enron.  The current Enron Corp. policy requires approvals by: 1.  The President (or equivalent) of Enron North America Corp. 2.  General Counsel of ENA (Mark Haedicke) 3.  Executive VP, Corp. Development of Enron Corp. 4.  Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.  2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.  I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.  Let's discuss. 
 Hi Mom,  I am doing fine.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier.  Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.  I am staying busy with the usual stuff.  Talked to Sharon last week.  It sounds like she is getting really close to the time.  Another grandchild.  Are ya'll going up to Dallas shortly after the birth? 
 Rusty, Per Nick's request, attached is the form of professional services agreement we have used for Enron North America. 
 Max,  Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.  They revised the Collateral limits in Section 4.5.  Let me know your thoughts. 
 My username is P00502719 and password is 14369477. 
 I will put in on my calendar. 
 Andy,  I have a few comments.  Attached is a redline. 
 Ken,  Attached is your document with my comments. 
 fyi 
 Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.  Please review. 
 Hey GT,  When are you coming to H-town? 
 Attached for review are the draft template GTC and Confirm forms for the monthly wellhead and pooling point purchase business of ENA Upstream.  Please review and provide any comments you may have as soon as possible.  We would like to implement these templates for October business going forward.  Judy,  We need to discuss how the "Keep Whole" language used for the torch deal, should be incorporated into these forms for those deals with the negotiated Keep Whole.  Ellen, has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss. 
 It was very nice running into you also.  Banker, smanker.  G works hard for the money, so you had better treat him right.  What do you have going on this week?  Thurs. or Fri. after work would work.  (That sounds weird) 
 Attached is the precedent agreement with changes redlined.  I scanned their hardcopy.  I added that same outs that were included in the Momentum agreements, but I left the dates blank.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Let's discuss on Thursday. 
 Attached is the form of amendment to guaranty for Tractebel.  Do you know the $$ limits for signing authority for Bridgeline.  I.e. when do the management member have to sign a guaranty as opposed to Randy Curry? 
 FYI 
 I actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to Keith for him to review.  I think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer.  Do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents?  We will need to have one to finalize the documents. 
 Keith,  Please note the following changes for the Napoleonville warehouse s= ale docs.  I will call you to discuss further issue to getting this finaliz= ed. 
 John, The meeting is tomorrow at 2:00 in 30C2 
 Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.  I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.  Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues? 
 Thanks for your help on this! 
 I am fine with this form. 
 After this hearing staff makes a recommendation to the commission.  The commission decision should be issued in late Oct. or early Nov. 
 Ned,  Attached is the revised  CSI CA based on our discussion.  The non-compete provision is removed.  As we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our Confidential Information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ECS.  However, they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our Confidential Information. 
 Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!  Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer.  The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet? 
 Judy,  Attached are the Torch Docs redlined with my changes.  I also changed some the the title on Exhibit A. 
 Max,  Tyrell is attempting to set up a conference call with these guys for Monday afternoon.  He will get back to us with the details. 
 Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.  The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.  G$ 
 Overall I would give her a 5.  I would request her again. 
 Attached are the revised redlined docs. per our discussion.  Let me know if you need me to review these with Mariner's counsel. 
 Sometimes you just have to step up to the big leagues.  I actually didn't know how much that trash can costs.  The ex bought it.  It is stainless steel, not chrome. I will sell you mine for $90.  I will even Lysol it for you.   Congrats on your oversized chair with ottoman. 
 XX-Large.  Thanks. 
 Sorry,  Jean Mrha's assistant should have it. 
 No problem,  I thought it was a day game when said I would come in on Friday.  Enjoy your Fri.

 Mark,  Attached is a draft.  Please review and let's discuss before you send to Huber. 
 Judy,  I added the language for release by Mariner that we discussed.  I put a 3 day threshold in the language.  Please review and lets discuss.

 Hey Tracy,  Yes you are correct.  That is a fantastic picture of JJ.  Really miss that guy.  Young Frank doesn't seem to be enjoying the experience as much as Madeline.  Glad to hear things are going well for you guys.  All is good with me.  Not much new and exciting happening.  Thanks for the pics!

 Yes 
 Forgot to forward earlier.

 Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The rate sheet they provided would be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review.  I am ok to forward this to Power Engineers for their review. 
 Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they would prefer to terminate or void this contract.

 Mary,  Please prepare a draft bi-latieral CA with the following entity:  RealEnergy, Inc. 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 755 Los Angeles, California 90067  The topic of the CA should be information concerning a potential sale of natural gas and/or provision of transportation capacity for RealEnergy's distributive generation requirements in southern California.

 Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion. 
 Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:  Bay Gas Storage 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft Lease Agreement 3.  Draft O&M Agreement    Oakhill 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.    Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks. 
 Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper.

 Stephanie,  I made a few changes.  Please review. 
 Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!  Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!  Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.  Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  Gerald 
  Re-sending.  Didn't go through the first time. 
  Resending,  Didn't go through the first time. 
  Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin? 
  Hey Ernie,  Have you been able to send email to Bieraugel?  I replied to the email address he sent, but I keep receiving undeliverable messages. 
 Darren, I will be meeting with Sandi in the morning to get a download.  I will get with you after that to assess where we need to go.  Thanks. 
 Nelson,  Attached is the Confirm and GTC for the deal with Devon.  Please review and if acceptable you can forward to Devon for review. 
  Please see attached. 
 We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.  Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?  Gerald 
 I have seen no progress.  I will call my contact again to inquire.  Any prodding you could provide through the credit dept. would be welcome. 
   I need a couple of CA for the following information.  The need to be bilateral agreements.  Please use the bi-lateral form, that you and I have used before.  The Enron entity is Enron Compression Services Company.  Ned will be sending a more detailed scope shortly and I will forward. Please come to me with any questions. 
  John,  Per our discussion, attached is a draft form of gathering agreement.  This form is a firm committed reserves gathering agreement. If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
  Mary,  Attached is further detail for the project descriptions for the two CAs I requested.  Please revise the CA to read "information in connection with sharing data relative to a potential electric compression project located approximately 3 miles west of Carthage, Texas in Panola, County".  Follow that form with the Duke CA as well.  Please prepare two executables of each.  Thanks for all your help. 
 Mary,  The CA form had ENA in the text.  Please make sure it is Enron Compression Services Company. 
  Janel,  How is it going?  I booked this flight for myself.  Talked to Bruce and he is trying to set up a beach house or in the alternative, rooms for us at the Sea Trail hotel.  Let me know if you want me to book a rental car for us to share.  G 
 Paul,  Attached are redlines of the confirms that were revised with the changes we discussed. 
 Mary,  Chris is the guy who called me asking the questions.  I have a call into Sandi to see if she knows anything about this.  If not, I don't know who would know. 
 Please disregard the prior version. 
 Brucie,  You weren't supposed to tell anybody about that!!  Maureen,  I am planning on setting up a rental car for Janel and myself and we can cut you in on that action.  Our flight leaves Myrtle Beach at 11:40 on Sunday so if you are leaving out of Myrtle Beach that might work for you also.  Gerald 
  FYI,  Attached is the form of lease agreement that Hanover has forwarded for our lease of the compression equipment from Hanover on the Oakhill deal.

 Sorry,  The number is 202-342-0800. 
 Dave,  Made a few slight tweaks. 
 Mary,  Is this an operational type filing or an entity type filing?  If it is operational, then it is probably someone else's issue. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of Oneok's form of guaranty with my comments incorporated.  Please forward to Oneok for their review.  I will prepare the executable form of Bridgeline Holdings, LP guaranty for Oneok per your email yesterday.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Sorry about the delay.  I had to figure out where the IT guy's had moved all this stuff when Shawna departed.  Let me know if you have questions. 
 If you can fit it in.  I am pretty covered with ENA Upstream right now. 
 Tried to send this earlier.  Will try again. 
 Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks. 
 I am going. 
 Attached are draft responses to WFEC requests for documents and request for interrogatories.  Please review and provide any input as soon as possible.  Thanks. 
 Please review and provide any input as soon as possible.  Bill,  I still have not talked with Jeff Stone. 
 Hey Dan,  Good to hear from you.  I am doing fine. Sounds like fun.  I will try to make it.  I might get caught up here at work though.  I am leaving the country on Thursday for 4 days, so I am trying to tie up some loose ends here.  All my stripper friends are not returning my calls for some reason!  Hmmph!!. 
 Bill made a few changes.  All of which I am OK with.  If these are OK with you, we will forward these to WFEC. 
 Bill,  The answers as modified by you are fine.  Please forward those to Mr. Haswell at your earliest convenience.  I have still not received any response from Jeff Stone. 
 Attached are draft agreements for both entities. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is a redline with my comments. 
 That is fine.  Go ahead and set it up. 
 Attached for your further handling is the confirm and GTC for the EEX E&P Company purchase by ENA Upstream.  Note that we need to have them sign the confirm, so we will need two executed originals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Please fill out the Data Sheet and send to Kay Young  Form of CA    Data Sheet Form

 Attached is a draft of the Confid. Agreement we discussed. 
 Brian,  Attached are drafts of the following docs.:  1.  Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement 2.  Transaction Agreement to the Master Enfolio  We are still undergoing some internal review of these, but to move the process forward please review the attached.

 Can you please send it to Jeff Hodge, since he initialed the orginal agreement.  Thanks. 
 Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.

 FYI 
 Judy,  Attached is the Pioneer Confirm.  Please insert all the relevant contact information.  Also please carefully review the confirm to make sure that I interpreted your email info. correctly.  I left a blank for the Field information.  I would ask the counterparty to fill in and return a copy to ENA Upstream. 
 Attached is a revised form of affidavit.  Please review and provide any comments asap. 
 Staci,  Attached is a draft of an affidavit the ECS is proposing to supply West Florida Electric Coop regarding an informal requests for documents that ECS received from WFEC.  Please review and lets discuss asap. 
 Susanne,  What is the status of the professional services agreement? 
 Staci,  Attached is the final form of affidavit.  We plan on emailing this version to WFEC's lawyer for review prior to execution.  Given the confidentiality provision in our CSA, could you please respond via email with FGT's approval of this disclosure.  Thanks. 
 Per my voicemail, attached is the master spot contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Susanne,  Attached is a redlined agreement with the revision to Section 8.3 we discussed.  If acceptable, I will prepare two executables for routing.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached is the revised CA per my discussion with their attorney.  Please review and forward to Anadarko. 
 Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out. 
 Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare two separate CAs between Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Enron Compression Services Company.  You can use the bilateral form we normally use.  Rusk's information is  Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. P.O. Box 1169 Henderson, Texas 75653-1169  The scope for the two CAs is as follows:  1.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at OGS Pipeline, L.L.C.'s Hinkle Compressor Station"  2.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at Anadarko Energy Services Company's Carthage Facility"  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help! 
 Paul,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed which revises the Devon purchase docs to match the Gathering Agreement with Lost Creek.  Please review and let me know if you are OK.  If so, I can prepare the executables and Fedex to Devon. 
 Attached is the revised Ormat CA per your email.    Also, I don't have any notes on the Energy Transfer CA.  Sorry about that. 
 The drafts per our discussion. 
 Yes,  This looks to be a separate deal and mine was only a spot deal. 
 Based on our discussions yesterday, attached are the BHP Confirm and GTC.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  We still need to input the Delivery Point information. 
 Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.  Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA. 
 Chris,  I am fine with his revision if you are OK with the terms. 
 Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks. 
 Ellen,  Let's talk about this before you send out. 
 Sandi,  The following are the contracts that were inadvertantly assigned to AEP in the sale as we discussed.  Centana Intrastate Pipeline Co. 	#96019236 EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.  	#96006479 EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.	#96041930 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc.	#96041723 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc.	#96041724  Let me know your thoughts on the best way to proceed to return these deals to ENA.  Thanks.  Miss me?  Gerald 
 I already made that mistake once. 
 Larry,  The letter looks fine to me. 
 Raimund,  Attached is a form of amendment for both the Athens and Hartwell Precedent Agreement.  The amendment modifies the termination date as we discussed.  Two pieces of info that I left blank are the new date to be inserted and the date of execution of the original precedent agreements.  I do not have a copy of the dated executed PAs.  I do have a copy of the guaranties.  I will forward a copy to you.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mary,  Can you please prepare executables of the attached document.  There are some redlined changes, all of which I am OK with.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you. 
 This deal was done some time ago.   I assume that all ENA Upstream deal makers going forward know they should be going through you. 
 Wasn't sure if you were copied on all this. 
 Attached is the CA for the project we discussed with NNG.  Let me know when you want executable agreements. 
 I don't want to know what Paul did in a hot tub with Lars.  I know he is easy, but jeez. 
 Might be too late, but attached are the letters with my revisions.  Let me know if you still need me to initial. 
 I am fine with this term sheet. 
 Attached is a draft of the McCook agreement.  I am still cleaning up the Management Services Agreement (for scheduling etc.) to be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review 
 Mark,  Could you please review the attached.  The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.  ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the Enron entity needing access.  The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.  Let me know if I am mistaken.  Thanks. 
 Revised per your voicemail. 
 Mark,  Attached are the latest.  I smoothed out some of your changes and added a section in the TA to address assignment of the gathering agreement.  Please review. 
 Judy,  Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.  Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.  Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.  Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.  Thanks. 
 I am fowarding the originals to you.  Please obtain execution for ENA Upstream and ENA and return them both to me.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the quick turnaround on that.  Any word on when we can expect this to be set for hearing? 
 Attached is the revised draft based on Stephanie's comments.  Please review. 
 See my attached comments. 
 Mary,  Please forward me, via email, the two Rusk County Electric Cooperative Agreements you previously prepared for me.  Thanks. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is the revised agreement with my changes. 
 Attached are the revised CA's for the compression projects with Rusk County.  I have added Northeast Texas as a party to both agreements.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Revised per our discussion.  Please forward to Citizens. 
 With my revisions: 
 Nelson,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments  1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues. A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase". We would have to tie this down. C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.  3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity  In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper? 
 The term sheet looks fine. 
 I am sure I didn't do as good a job as Michael Keeton did! 
 Sorry to hear about Aunt Lillie.    Good to hear everything is ok with you guys.  Everything is going well here.  Just the usual with work and weekend activities.  Been spending a little more time with Paul, since he is not going to Tulsa every week.  Take care and a I love you both. 
 Hey E,  Good to hear from you again.  Not much new around here.  Working and partying.  Still trying to restock the girlfriend pipeline.  George's email is gtownsend@manorisd.net.  I haven't played any golf recently, but do like to play.  I am pretty horrible, but it is fun nonetheless.  I would definetly be up for a round some time. Let me know.  Have you been able to email Bieraugel at the last address he sent?  I have tried, but my emails keep getting bounced back to me. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the referenced agreement.  I will forward Exhibit A to the agreement shortly.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Count me in. 
 Please see attached. 
 Attached is the agreement revised per your notes. 
 Keith,  Attached are our comments and revisions.  Please review and let me know if you see any problems.  We would like to send this to the counterparty tommorrow, so please respond asap.  Thanks. 
 Nathan,  Can you describe where Encore compression is located? 
 Judy,  Attached is the GTC to be used for the Mariner deal with the revisions we discussed.  I will be out Thurs. and Fri. but will check voicemail. 
 Haven't heard anything on this deal. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare a CA based on the following information.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Brian, See the attached memo based on my review of the hurricane docs.  Nothing really different than what Bridgeline indicated in the meeting on Monday.  Let's discuss at your convenience. 
 Attached is the amendment form for the El Paso Guaranty.  Please forward to El Paso for their review.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Thanks for the info Mike.  I will give her a call.  I had a blast on Friday.  We'll have to do a happy hour again soon.  Maybe we can get the AEP girls to show up. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised doc per our discussion. 
 The latest. 
 Hey Sam,  Actually it comes out every weekend as much as I try to control it.  I had a great time.  We will have to do that again sometime! 
 Yes,  You can delete. 
 Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of  "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"  We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.  I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.  P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him. ;-)  Gerald 
 Keith,  Attached is the form PSA for the sale of the Napoleonville Lot and Warehouse we discussed.  LRCI, Inc. not Houston Pipe Line Company will be the selling Enron entity.  You should be receiving the appraisal that was prepared for the land today via Fedex.  Let me know if you have any questions.  (713) 853-3512. 
 Brent,  Please see the revised guaranty. 
 Do you have an address for these guys? 
 Attached is the template for the FM letter. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the draft letter.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 Jean,  For your review.  Specifically, the scope in the lead in paragraph. 
 Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Judy,  I will be working on that form next.  Should be ready tommorrow or Monday.  For the Linder dealer we can use the firm GTC with a modified DCQ.  I forwarded the language for the DCQ to Ellen. 
 Mark,  Please see attached. 
 Mark,  Attached are the latest. 
 John,  I have revised the variance language based on our discussion.  Please review. 
 Janette,  I plan on attending the CLE on August 22 at the Doubletree.  Thanks. 
 I am fine with the changes.  I revised the term from 1 year to 2 years.  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the CA.  I am OK to forward to Marathon. 
 Looks good. 
 Yes 
 Judy,  Let me visit with Jeff on the 6 month threshold for the Committed Reserves.  Otherwise I am OK with this Matrix. 
 Attached is a draft CA.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 We might want to forward this email version for their review first.  I would think that their attorney's might have a few comments. 
 Mark,  Made a few small comments.  See attached. 
 Joan,  Attached is the agency agreement form.  The form still refers to TBI Field Services.  This should be revised to reflect the current owner of the system.  Can you provide that info. 
 It is still on Chris Hilgert's desk.  I will bug him to get it back to you.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Paul,  Attached is the revised letter Agreement for Greeley.  Please review and if you are OK with it, please forward to Greeley.  They had asked that we drop the contract number references in the first paragraph, but we need to have some way of identifying the contracts under which we are acting as agent, so l kept them in the document.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 That sounds good.  Schedule it up with Majed. 
 Please use the attached GTC is place of the previously forwarded for all deals going forward. 
 Not anytime soon, but within the next couple of weeks. 
  Alan,  With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company, Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.  These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.  The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.  There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal.  Enron's general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month. I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 The only change is in Section 2.  I refer to the requirement to schedule the Daily Contract Quantity instead the Nomination. 
 Yea,  Things have changed quite a bit.  Life as usual at Enron. 
 Randy, For your information, I am forwarding you a summary of my review of the Bridgeline documents concerning the Texaco Sorrento cavern issues This summary was prepared on behalf of Enron. 
 Keegan please print two executables of the attached on Enron Logo Letterhead.  I need these this afternoon.  Thanks. 
 Fyi 
 Keegan, I think the attached is a Word Perfect File.  Can you try to convert this file to an MSWord file.  Thanks. 
 I have a conflict and will not be able to attend.  Let me know if there is any thing you need my help on. 
 Keith,  The attached document was blank.  Could you resend the document? 
 That sounds good.  We'll see you at 12 on Friday. 
 Paul,  Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the changes we discussed.  Please review and forward to Greeley for their review. 
 Attached is the draft that was provided to WFEC's counsel.  As I stated they have requested to depose ECS as well. 
 I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.  Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a hall pass from your better half. 
 Keith,  Attached is the revised PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse.  I removed the mineral rights reservations and added in the sales price.  Please review. The agreement needs to be forwarded for review by the Assumption Police Jury as follows:  Attn:  Kim Torres Assumption Parish Police Jury P.O. Box 524 Napoleonville, LA 70390  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the redline version. 
 Attached is a draft of the mowing letter for Assumption Parish.  Please review.  The address needs to be added in Exhibit A.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 David Marshall (risk management, insurance group) will be the one to set the limits.  I usually send a copy of the agreement and ask for his comments.  I can handle once we get a draft of the agreement. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Boeing Contract with my revisions.  Please review, specifically Section 4.2 and Article 7.  I want to make sure you are OK with those sections specifically.  Sorry for the delay on this. 
 Jean,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.

 Chris,  Richard and I have come to agreement on the Shell CA.  Attached is a redline with the changes.  Please forward to Shell for their review and I will send down executables. 
 Attached is a draft of the CA.  Please review.  I need the full legal name of Illinois Power. 
 There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.  There isn't too much towards Enron.  I don't mind going towards your building.  You have probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building. Good Italian. There is also a Cafe Express down there. I am OK with any of those.  Do you like Sushi?  There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center. 
 Let's discuss when you get a chance. 
 Sounds good.  I'll see you there. 
 Dave, How about tommorrow at 2 pm central.  Let me know. 
 Needs the facts filled in. 
 It was great talking with you at lunch.  I have never known a real life tap dancer before.  I feel honored.  I am outta here tomorrow, so have a great weekend. 
 Made a few slight revisions. 
 No problem.  Let it go. 
 Chris,  Attached is a form of interconnect agreement with reimbursement language that you requested on behalf of Hugh Connett.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 The entity should be LRCI, Inc.  You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Jean, Based on Richard's reply, I am OK with the strike.  I just wanted to make it clear that ENA does compete with Marathon is these areas, but ENA would certainly only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of the proposed Transactions.  Do you want me to prepare executables? 
  Mary,  Can you check to see if Jempy can sign for LRCI, Inc. and let Rakhi Israni know?  In the alternative, please provide her a copy of the corporate data sheet which list the VPs who can execute documents for LRCI. 
 Chris,  I need the project scopes as well.  Can you give me brief descriptions? 
 Keegan,  Please print out two originals of the attached CA for execution on ENA letterhead.  I will need to initial.  Thanks 
 Few comments. 
 I don't know the status of the Crawfish documents.  I will have to check.  Steve Van Hooser was handling those documents.  With respect to your previous question, the PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse went to the Assumption Parish last week. 
  Hey Jennifer,  How is it going? Did you survive your long run this weekend?  It has been pretty crazy here since I got back.  I really need to start focusing more on the guitar so I can become rich and famous and not have to deal with all this.  I am so tired. 
 The sections are 18 CFR Part 161.  Specifically Section 161.1, 161.2, and 161.3. 
 Alan,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of Enron's Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.    Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.  1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does. 2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters. 3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues. 4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters. 5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.  Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 Do you have any tiered pricing language for 5 tiers? 
 Attached is the revised Committed Reserves Confirm with the language we discussed.  Please modify the confirm templates for the Sept. wellhead deals (and those remaining from August) to reflect the revision.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Janette, To be more complete, the MS Word program Barbara and I were referring to on voicemail removes the Meta Data from the document. 
 Keegan,  Can you print the attached doc. on Enron Logo Only letterhead. This version had redlines, so you will need to accept the changes before printing. 
 Attached is a draft for your review.  Note that, Prior to giving any information received from Anadarko to CSI, we would need to get Anadarko's written permission. 
 They won't leave. 
 Shane,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language. 
 You can save it in my Confidentiality Agreements folder. 
 I added Section 5 - Non-Compete. 
 Ed, Can you help me out with this?  Kay is out of the office. 
 Attached is the agreement with my revisions. 
 I have not received it yet. 
 For your review, attached is a draft of the processing language for Riceland Ralco.  Please provide any comments you may have. 
 Please see attached and let me know if you have any comments or questions. 
 Mary,  Those will be fine for the other LRC entities. 
 The Parties shall keep the terms and provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential and shall not disclose them, in whole or in part without the written consent of the other Party.  If any Party shall be required by any court, legislative or administrative body to, whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, or some other processes, any Party shall have the full right and ability to disclose same without regard to the confidentiality covenant herein contained; provided, however, that such Party shall provide the other Parties with as much notice of its requirement to make such disclosure as is reasonably practicable and do all things that the other Parties may reasonably request, at the other Parties' cost, to facilitate the other Parties' efforts to eliminate or restrict such requirement. 
 Jeff,  Attached is the letter with a few comments.  The only substantive comment concerns cost tracking.  We would like to be informed of the overall project costs as they are incurred.  Please see the attached redlined doc. with my comments.  Let me know if Gulf is OK with these changes.  We would like to get this finalized early tomorrow morning.  Thanks. 
 The language looks fine to me. 
 LRCI, Inc. is fine with recording the map. 
 Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks. 
 Lisa,  I am fine with the changes.  Just insert the langauge into the confirm under the heading "Processing". 
 Let me know, how you want to handle this.

 Keegan's Info 
 I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following  1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000 3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.  Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.  2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40 Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)  Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.  3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500  I find no basis for this in the contract.   Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a draft of the Keep Whole language we discussed last week.  Please review and provide any comments you may have. 
 Deb,  Could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities:  Louisiana Resources Company LRCI, Inc. Louisiana Gas Marketing Company LGMI, Inc.  Thanks 
 Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues. 
 Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier. 
 I know how you feel.  No way Nebraska should be playing for the championship.  Should be Oregon. 
 I will see if we can get someone from the bankruptcy team for Wed. 
 Attached is the review performed so far on the gas contract list you forwarded.  I only reviewed the physical master from Barry's list.  The attached also included some contracts that Frank asked for review.  I will have more updates tomorrow. 
 Please send of future email updates to: gnemec@houston.rr.com 
 Leslie,  The technical name is:  Blanket Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 7C of the Natural Gas Act and 18 CFR 284.402. 
 Your thoughts? 
 Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:  All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name  1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.  2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.  Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.  Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements. 
 Karen,  Please get with Mary Ogden.  She can retrieve the schedules for you from our legal files.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a brief of these contracts.  I can help you work through the agreements if needed.  Thanks. 
 Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.  Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!  Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.  Let me know when you get some time.  G 
 Mark,  I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.  Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.  I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal. 
 I left it with Leslie after I reviewed yesterday. 
 I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight. 
 We found no termination notice. 
 Please see attached.  Please note that that physical gas purchase and sale is as follows:  ECS Compression Company LLC receives the gas from TW under the CSA ECS Compression Company LLC sells the gas to Enron Compression Services Company Enron Compression Services Company sells the gas to ENA (Gallup) or to Enron Gas Marketing Corp. (Bisti/Bloomfield) 
 I would like to nominate OU's 16-13 defeat by OSU as the Most Humiliating Upset of the Year. 
 At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.  We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.  Also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the Bankruptcy Ct. and the DIP financing.  I can look into it if it necessary, but does it really help the cash situation? 
 Susan,  Could you look for and email me the following:  Storage Agreement with Montana Power Interruptible Storage Agreement with WBI Transport Agreement with Trailblazer Pipeline Company (Think it was dated around 1995)  Sorry for the sketchy info, but that is all that I have.  Thanks. 
 Bruce,  Give me a call when you get a chance.  We have much to talk about in recruiting.  Let's see.......  Albert Hardy, Rodrique Wright, and now Marco Martin.  Unbelievable.  If we could only land Vincent Young. 
 Kellie,  Have you updated the transport list yet? 
  Here, Here,  I would like to second Ernie's sentiments.  We are very proud of you guys and hope that you stay safe.  Drop us a note if you can. 
 I still haven't received the final update.  This is the latest. 
 Do you have anything for HomeTown Communications Network.  Looking for a gas  contract dated 6/14/01 
 No.  This must be the Pulp & Paper GTC to which they are referring.  They didn't specifically note it as a gas deal.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached is the only I have for Kachina. 
 Thanks.  Could you also look for a Enfolio Master Firm with Kaztex Energy Management Inc. and ENA dated August 1, 2001. 
 Debra Perelingiere had prepared this contract.  Since it was done so recently, it may not have made it into the system yet. Thanks for your help.  I'll check Debra's files. 
 Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Service= s Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas u= nder its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company= .  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS deli= very of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA und= er a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been d= esperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipe= line worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Mark= eting, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in = the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,00= 0 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a l= ong term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (appro= ximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a = potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide= any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the cur= rent situation. 
 In addition to the Philadelphia Gas Works contracts, could you also look for a Husky Oil Operations Limited with ENA dated September 1, 1999.  Thanks. 
 Thanks Susan.  Can you send me any GTC that would have been for Nov -01 through March 02 business for PGW. 
 Per my phone conversation with Cheryl Hartsell, I hereby give permission for Unimark LLC to provide a copy of the contract with ENA Upstream Company, LLC dated October 20, 2001 to the producer who gas was sold by Unimark under such contract; provided that Unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract.  If you need any further information, please contact me at (713) 853-3512. 
 I did prepare these. 
  Per my phone conversation with Cheryl Hartsell, I hereby give permission for Unimark LLC to provide a copy of the contract with ENA Upstream Company, LLC dated October 20, 2001 to the producer who gas was sold by Unimark under such contract; provided that Unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract.  If you need any further information, please contact me at (713) 853-3512. 
 Attached is a draft of the Dow Amendment.  I used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of August 8.  Date and prices are left blank for negotiation.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Stuart,  I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.  Please review attached.  The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept:  1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.  2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are. 
 The only way would be to copyright the material.  Any original writing can be copyrighted.  At a minimum, I would mark any submission as Copyrighted material.  I don't know the specific requirements for filing.  You might want to do some net research on the subject.  I would think the Fed. Government would have a web site on how to copyright material.  Hope this helps. 
 Mark,  Attached for your review is a draft of the Capacity Release agreement we discussed. 
   Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Rakhi,  Attached is the form of cash sale for the Crawfish Property.  Please review and if OK you can forward to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Ellen,  Let's talk about the attached. 
 Chris,  Attached is the info I have on this deal.  My contact info is:  Gerald Nemec Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith St. (EB3874A) Houston, TX 77002 
 Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.  They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.  Later. 
 Attached are the Mexicana Amendments and New Confirm.  Jason, As I left in my voicemail, I want to make sure you are OK with the credit provisions inserted into the GTC.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a new confirm I have prepared for Mexicana 
 Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work, her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts, washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes, bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there. A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.  G 
 Attached are the two contracts which will replace the single original, as we discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. 
 Revised per our discussion. 
 FYI,  Do we have any Peoples concerns here? 
 Attached are clean and redlined versions of the docs with revisions. 
 Attached is a clean version of the LOI.  I only revised what was paragraph 6.  I tried to redline, but it picked up all the previous changes. 
 I am OK with their changes, as long as you are OK with removal of those counterparties. 
 Bill,  Attached is the information we discussed.  I enjoyed talking with you today.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Keith is forwarding hard copies of the documents.  As soon as I recieve them, I will review, initial, and forward to you for execution. 
 Keegan,  Please print out two executables of the attached on bond paper.  Thanks. 
 Hey Ern,  Sorry it took me awhile to get back with you.  As you can imagine, it is pretty crazy around here.  Yes, it has been very interesting around Enron these days.  I think we pull through, but I expect the stock to take a beating for awhile.  The media has been pounding us for the last couple of weeks.  Saw George at the Colorado game.  Seems to be doing well.  George was definitely ready to get married, so I think he is really enjoying the married life.  Ran into a couple of old Wranglers including Carl Jackson.  Do you remember Kenny Reineger?  We saw him at the endzone club.  Also ran into Stacy......SAR!  She looks exactly the same.  Haven't heard anything from Bieraugel.  I sure he is up to his eyeballs busy with kickin some Taliban butt.  How is life at FritoLay.  The economy effecting you guys any? 
 Ken,  Attached is the Agreement with my comments redlined over your changes.  Sorry for the delay  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  By copy of this email, I am requesting David Marshall to review the insurance section (Section 11) and provide any comments he may have. 
 Keegan,  Please print out 6 executables of the following:   And 8 executables of the following:     Please FEDEX two original two each counterparty to the address listed in the contract.  Some counterparties are on both contracts, so they will recieve four originals for execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sorry for the delay on this Jill, I was out sick yesterday. 
 Thursday afternoon is better for me.  If it must be done Wed. please coordinate with my assistant Keegan Farrel 
 Attached is the LOI with my comments redlined.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Brian,  Attached are  the letter and Exhibit with my changes.  I have included a clean and redlined version.  Please review. 
 Attached is the draft. 
 Lisa,  I am fine with your changes.  The language that you highlighted in red should read "the Parties enter into a defintive agreement(s) for the compression services".  Please make the change.  Let me know if you need anything further. 
 Sounds like you have been busy.  Work sucks.  Everybody is really stunned and depressed.  Plus, I have been sick since Sunday.  I have missed a couple of days of work.  Not a good week for the G.    Sorry to be such a bummer.  Anyway, glad that you like Lucinda.  She does good work.  We'll catch up this weekend. 
 Kyle,  Do you have any information on this waste disposal site?  Apparently there is a meeting on November 15th to assess each party's liability for cleanup and Louisiana Resources Company is named.  Is anybody working on this?

 Darren,  Please review the attached ASAP. 
 Paul,  Attached is the Kennedy Amendment.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Kennedy. 
 Attached is the final version of the Master. 
 I added to the language we discussed. 
 Attached is the structure with my comments.  Concerning the earlier question.  It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.  Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.  I revised the transaction sheet to reflect this.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Chris,  Attached are driving directions to Nicor's Troy Grove site.  Per our discussions, please verify whether the site is in Illinois Power's territory. 
 Attached are the consent to assignment letters. We will need two executables of each.  Let me know if you will be the one sending these out for execution. 
 Robert,  The original contribution agreement called for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. to acquire consent for these assignments.  They were required to use "all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents".  To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.  I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.  What is the current status of this $25,000 per month bill.  Has Bridgeline invoiced us? 
 Attached is the guaranty with my comments.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is an amended and restate Torch confirm.  The Exhibit was revised to add two more points.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Judy Thorne had sent out all earlier documents.  I don't know who she sent them to.  Nelson should know. 
 I am OK with their comments.  Who is the correct "Counterparty" for this guaranty? 
 Attached are David's insurance comments.  I agree with his mark-ups.  Feel free to contact David directly to discuss. 
 Please see attached I added language concerning the firmness of that portion converted to a fixed price.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Art,  Per our phone conversation, attached is the revised language for Section 4.4 of the Master Firm Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, we will prepare executables and forward for signature.

 I agree with your summary. 
 Brandi,  Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement for Torch.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Stacy Dickson is taking this one. 
 I am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.  Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals? 
 Clement,  Attached is the form of guaranty we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of guaranty from Enron Corp.  This guaranty is currently be routed for approval. 
 Ken, Below is the revised language for the restriction on activities paragraph in the Cash Sale Form  The Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.  Additionally, Buyer shall erect and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a suitable chain-link fence between Vendor's retained adjacent property and the purchased Property. 
  Keith,  Could you look at this form and scrub it for Louisiana law issues. 
  FYI 
 For your review. 
 Chris,  Attached is the document to which Russell and I have agreed.  Next step is for us to get signed and fax to Russell.  Do you have the tract descriptions that Gulf forwarded?  Does Dave? 
 Ken,  We are in receipt of your revised sale form.  We will review.  I also need the following items by today to fully complete my review.  1.  Any comments you have to the restriction language I proposed. 2.  Draft of the Board Resolution you added to the Act of Sale. 3.  Any other comments you have.  Please forward this information ASAP. 
 FYI,  The latest. 
 Dan,  This is the only transport agreement I found in that directory. 
 Chris,  The letter was signed and faxed to Gulf at approximately 5 pm today. 
 Lisa,  My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.  Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as "ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements). 
 Attached is the revised guaranty form.  Let me know if you need anything else for execution. 
 Attached is a redline of the Act of Sale with my comments.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will draft the resolution this afternoon. 
 Mark/Lance,  Attached is a legal risk memo concerning the sale of land in Louisiana by the ENA Upstream Group (Jean Mrha - Commerical Contact).  The memo will be attached to a DASH which is being circulated for signature today.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  Per our discussion attached are the drafts of revised Act (redlined with my comments) and the Board Resolution for your review. 
 See attached.  I took a guess at the payment timing and our involvement in the construction process.  Do we want to let Jim, review that section also?  I am trying to leave the office by 12 tomorrow.  Any comments ASAP would be appreciated.  Upon receipt of comments, I will forward to Bill Howell. 
 Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:  1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000. 2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. 3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info? 4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, Robert?  To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America Corp. 
 For your review is the draft Construction Expedition Letter per our discussions Monday. 
 Nora,  The notes were paid off.  We do need to cancel the originals.  Let me know if I need to do anything. 
 Attached are the documents we discussed.  I have a attached a clean and redline version of the Act of Sale, compared against the prior version we sent.  Upon your final approval, we will prepare executables. 
 Eric,  Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. owns the other 60%.  The LP is governed by a management committee with two member from Enron and two from Texaco.  I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.  However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.  Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.  For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.  His phone number is 713-345-6374. 
 Resending.  Thanks. 
 Attached are my Louisiana counsel's comments to our ROW form.  I agree with his changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 The final sign off from Reliant legal.  I will prepare the executables and get them to Eva. 
 Stephen,  We will revise the termination date to be May 27, 2002. 
 Please review and let's discuss. 
 Last week was crazy.  Sorry about this.  I will send them out today. 
 I found this doc.  Hope it is the one you needed. 
 Eric,  See attached with my changes.  Robert, Can you provide the information Eric needs for Bridgeline.  Thanks. 
 Per our discussion, please review and provide comments asap. 
 Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 It was sitting on Haedicke's desk.  Eva, is going to pick it up and bring it to you for signature. 
 Attached is the latest version of the PA with my changes redlined.  Sorry for the delay. 
 FYI,  My Fla. counsel's comments to our letter. 
 Don't you have work to do today?  By the way, I will kick your ass for free! 
 Your leaving Friday? =20 
 Attached is the revised doc per our discussions. 
 Keith,  Please draft the letter and forward for my review.  Could you also forward the language for Item #1as you revised it?  Thanks. 
 Lisa, Your changes look fine to me.  I added the sentence to make it clear that ECS would not be owning and operating that portion of the equipment.  It wasn't clear to me from the section which indicate we will be arranging for the installation of the compressors. 
 Lisa,  I made significant revisions to this form.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Barry,  Attached are the drafts we discussed yesterday.  Please give me a call to discuss. 
 Attached is the confirm and GTC for the Wellhead purchase with Keep Whole language that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Dave,  I made a few slight changes to the agreement.  Nothing substantive, just to clarify and catch some typos.  I am OK with this form.  We need to make sure the Universal signs any schedules to this agreement which specify the operating parameters of the units.  Also, David Marshall will need to review the insurance section and address how we handle their self insurance issues. 
 Keith,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing Enron's use of the property.  No such uses should be found.  What specifically are they looking for with respect to this item.  Finally, any word on the title check with respect to item #3. 
 Ask them to print and sign two copies. 
 Mark and Dave,  Please print out two copies of each and execute all four.  The closing statements need to be printed on ENA Letterhead.  Sign all four and fax to Don Baldridge.  Put all four originals in the Fedex to me for initial.  I have asked Don to obtain execution of NBP's side and fax back to me.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the revised statement.  Please review.  I will have ENA execute as soon as I hear from NBP. 
 I responded to Frank about 20 minutes ago. 
  FYI 
 Frank,  Sandi Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help. 
 Larry,  What is the status of this permit? 
 For your review.  Let's talk early Monday. 
 Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.  I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify. 
  Chris,  Attached is Shonnie's draft of the Closing Statement.  Note that she nets out the amount with the payment due under the amended Master Services Agreement.  Please review. 
 Harry,  We have been using Bill Bryant and the Katz Kutter law firm to represent ECS' interest in the territorial dispute between Gulf Power and WFEC.  I forwarded your email to him and asked for his input.  Attached is his input.  I think his suggestion about a meeting with all parties involved is a good one.  Let me know what you think. 
 Kyle,  Attached are the final versions of the Servitude Agreement and the Filing Form.  We made some changes to the form for consistency.  Please review.  Roger and Rakhi, Please verify the legal description provided by Enterprise.  I also have a plat which I will forward to you for review.  After everyone has reviewed and approved we should be ready to go. 
 Keith, My changes are redlined.  Please provide any comments. 
    Kyle,  Attached is the agreement with the two changes I discussed on my voice mail message.  Please review.  Do we have a property description and a plat? 
 Kay, Please see the attached. 
 Please review the attached. 
 Ken,  Please review the attached. 
 Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.  Please review the amendment and schedules.  I revised the schedules further to make the base line calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions.    Note:  We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of HCC to review and approve this amendment.  Kevin Howard can sign and I have already prepared this document. 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions with the changes we discussed yesterday.  Please review the exhibits on both documents one last time. 
 Ken,  Attached is a revised draft of the Hanover Agreement based on all our discussions to date.  Please review.  I would prefer one more internal review prior to forwarding to Hanover.  Please note where information is still needed concerning the specific units for the schedule forms.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Greg,  I have never been to a tasting before.  Will there be some small foods to go along with the wine?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions incorporating the modified suggested Kennedy revisions we discussed.  Please review.  I will revised the Independant contracts later this afternoon.  I will also send you a form purchase and sale agreement for the Independant gathering facilities.  G$ 
 Here are some names. 
 I sent in the admission fees, so hope you still want to go. 
 Dan,  Attached are the latest independent docs with the Collection Facilities funding, construction, and fee structure.  I  am working on a form a construction agreement which will be attached as an Exhibit to the Field Services Agreement. 
 Dan,  Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes we discussed.  As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached agreements.  Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity? 
 Please review and forward to IPC.  This will be required to commit Niedigger gas to our purchasing and field services agreements. 
 Fine by me. 
 Here it  is.  Please revise as necessary. 
 David,  Attached is a construction agreement draft for a $750,000 gathering system between Sapphire Bay.LLC (of which ECT, Jedi II, and Independent are members) and Independent as contractor.  Sappire Bay will own the gathering system.  Please give me a call to discuss. 
 Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review. 
 Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.  I didn't want to forward this one to Hanover.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.  Please review and if it looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave. 
 The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement. 
 Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue. Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting this into a contract is a relatively simple matter. 
 Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement? 
 Attached is LOI with our revisions redlined.  Please review and call either Mark or myself to discuss. 
 Here it is. 
 I will be attending. 
 Dan,  Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.  Let me know if you or Kennedy have questions. 
 Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me through those times.  I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I don't have to think about all the pain.  We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either. However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, whatever happens in the near future.  I felt I just to had to write this email.  Gerald 
 Attached is the termination letter with my revision.  Both a clean and redlined version. 
 Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review and add any comments you have.  Thanks

 G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to?  As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.  I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.  Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be glad to contribute to the cause.  Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in. 
 Dan,  Attached are the 1st drafts. 
 Dan,  Please disregard the prior draft and use this one. 
 GT,  The theme of the party sounds excellent.  What time is the party on Friday and where does the boat leave?  I may take a day of vacation.  I have more than I can probably use this year.  G$    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Please disregard the version I sent about 30 minutes prior and use these.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Dan,  Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.  If not, I need to see all of them. 
 Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield contract):  1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure. 2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month. 3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment (Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above) 4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.  Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above if not for the Force Majeure event.  Thus,  5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption. 6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour charge do the following:  Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times (Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.  Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we need to.  Thanks. 
 I know love isn't enough by itself.  We have to give each other more.  The types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.  We have focused on material things,  when really more meaningful things, such telling the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some facet of life are what fills each other.  We are both bright and ambituous people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right context.  Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and wife.  Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, sounding boards, lovers,  shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or walk hand in hand on the beach.  I want to do these things for you and want you to do them for me.   Hope you can think of me.  Love, Gerald 
 Denise,  Attached is the agreement with changes redlined.  Please review and call me if you have questions.  (713) 853-3512 
 Thought you might be interested.  Just in case you aren't recieving these emails. 
 Has the few changes we discussed. 
 Meant to copy you on this. 
 Please read the attached and respond. 
 Here it is. 
 David,  Please review the attached document, specifically Section 6.7. 
 Attached are the changes we discussed today. 
 Rude Dog,  Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the edge.  Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game. But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.  The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good one.  Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.  G$ 
 I recieved both documents.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new Collection Facilities Agreement.  The Collection Facilities Agreement has the insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.  I will forward the Security Doc. shortly. 
 Attached is the security document form.  Section 5.4 is missing and I will provide tommorrow.  However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the agreement for review. 
 GT,   I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.  I plan on driving in Friday night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.  If its okay I'll crash at your place.  Let me know how your schedule looks.  Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35. Interested? 
 This version includes the Section 5.4 language. 
 Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the units contracted for during the initial 2 year period. 
 Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there are any problems.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the executable documents 
 Bob,  Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.  Please fax signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete contracts to me at:  EB3883 1400 Smith Houston, Tx 77002  Thanks for your help. 
 G,  I will be there about 9 pm tonight.  My cell phone # is 281-772-9250 
 I am fedexing the form of lease this morning.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Oooouch!    That one hurt.  We really kicked their butt all over the field. The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.  I don't think he had one completed on him all night.  What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team. I am trying not to get too down about this.  This is  a young team that is going to make mental errors and they will improve.  I still thinks we will have a good season.  The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.  He looks fast out there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.  He also got some snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding. Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles.  Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.  He look big and fast and gets yardages running in the interior.  Ike left a defender looking really stupid on his long TD run.  Sweet moves.  Hodges look about like he did last year. Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well.  OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford.   The thing I really like was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and that he will insure that they get fixed.  Mackovic would have made excuses that essentially put the blame elsewhere.   This season could be an up and down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.  Did you get any info on the game? 
 G,  I was thinking of bringing along a friend from Enron to the boat party. Unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party ratio.  He is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you and me.  His wife is out of town this weekend.  He won't mind sleeping on the floor.  Thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend.  Lisa is a really cool girl.  You two will have fun together. 
 Attached are the latest versions.  Call me if you have any questions (713) 853-3512. 
 Mark,  Attached are the letter agreement and Purchase and Sale Agreement. Please review.  Note there is a blank date in the letter agreement which needs to be provided.  If OK I will forward to TW. 
 Clean and redlined of final version 
 FYI Attached is the latest Enron Compression Services Company structure. 
 Attached is a revised LOI for WT1.   I took out all the language concerning materials and equipment obligations incurred by ECS.  After talking with Knippa, I understand that after the sale of the motor to TW, they will be doing all of the installation.  Please review and provide comments. 
 No problem.  I will review these and get back with Cheryl.  Thanks. 
 I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any questions, please contact me a x33512. 
 GT,   What is your schedule tommorrow.  I taking day off so I can leave whenever and be in Austin to help you out with the pre-party perparations.  G. 
 His name is Eric Gillaspie.  We will be at your casa shortly after 12. Looking forward to it.  Hook'em.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Cheryl,  We will handle the name change for ECT to ENA on the P-5 form.  Mary,  When you get a chance, come be and let's talk about what need to be done. 
 My new email info. 
 Just working on a Courtney deal while thoughts of you pop into my head.  One of the things I really love about you is how humble you are.  You are beautiful, confident, and intelligent, and yet you don't act like you know that.  I sincerely have always felt lucky to be with you. 
 Terry,  Attached is a PSA form we have used before with the perspective of Enron as buyer.  Probably a little more detailed than we need for this one since the facilities are only estimated at $200,000. Kennedy Oil is Seller and Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C. is Buyer.    Some further detail on the site lease agreement:  CounterParty is Black Hills Trucking, Inc Initial 1 year term, then month to month up to 2 years total Fee $800/month Black Hill will provide phone and electricity service hookup and Enron to reimburse Enron will directly pay phone and electricity bills Area is approximately  250 ft. X 400 ft. and is fenced off separately Include is existing 40 ft. X 40 ft. building on site. Enron reserve right to install any other building reasonably necessary for site to function as an equipment laydown yard Enron reserve right to install septic system for bathroom in buildings used by Enron Enron needs access at all times through Black Hills front gate to get to site. Enron will remove all equipment and buildings (except existing) upon termination. 
 Please see attached 
 Thanks for the quick response! 
 Rude-Dog,  Are you there? 
 GT,   Great party.  Looking forward to the next one already.  I think I left my cell phone charger in your apartment on your table.  If I did, just hold it.  I'll be back for Rice and pick it up then.  If not, I must have lost the damn thing somewhere else.  Later,  G$ 
 From the Oklahoma 100:    "Waylon Turdsby, star TE from the reigning 3-A champion Chickasha Fighting Chick-Peas gave the Sooners a verbal commitment by letter late Wednesday according to OK100 sources. This is a big boost to the Sooners who were competing with Tulsa, Anadarko Junior College and out of state powerhouse Kansas for his services. Waylon, who is 6'2", 218lbs and runs a 4.75 40 chose OU because "They serve fried pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet hairdos". Waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the family used car dealership. Waylon added "My daddy says he has done a lot of business with Sooner coaches and boosters over the years and that OU would be the best place to refine my used car selling skills." The great traditions of OU were also a factor according to Waylon, "They have this great tradition where they touch all the movie posters of OU legend Brian Bosworth before running out onto the field. You just don't get that kind of inspiration outside of OU." 
 Attached is a discussion draft of the Compression Services Agreement for Gallup. 
 Mary,  I was out of the office on Friday and unfortunately have a conflicting meeting scheduled.  Please let me know what we need to do to work out the details. 
 The operations information you requested should now be directed to Robert Morgan in Facility Planning.  I forwarded the sheets you left in my office last week to Robert for his review.  I handled this request before when I was in Facility Planning, but Robert has now taken my place.  Shonnie Daniel will work with you from the Legal Group perspective to give you any help you need. 
 Tom,  Attached is the Right of Way Services Agreement we discussed Friday.  I would like to thank you and Mark for meeting with us on short notice.  We look forward to working with you. 
 Ken,  Attached is the Black Hills Trucking lease agreement.  Please review to make sure it correctly captures your deal with Black Hills.  I am still reviewing from a legal perspective, so please do not forward until we have talked further. 
 That is hilarious.  You know it is a good party when you make the news.  Just talked to Ernie.  He didn't have your new email and work #.  He is planning on coming up for the Rice game.  You should be hearing from him shortly. 
 GT,  I think I will come in on Saturday morning.  If Lisa is out of town though and you want to chase women Friday night, my plans can change. 
 Hal,  FYI, Attached is another form of O&M agreement specifically for offshore lines.  The structure of this agreement is different from our current deal, but the provided services in this form may be a good start for the Mariner O&M form. 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined version of the purchase and gathering agreement.  There is no language in these agreement about a right to match outside of the Reserve Committment Area.  I haven't had a chance to bounce a separate agreement off of Shonnie yet, but will let you know.  Call me if you have any questions. 
 Tom,  Those items will be sent to you tommorrow. 
 Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly understand this after things have happened.  I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You are my one true love. 
 Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.  Hopefully you can redline it against your old version.  Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.  I think is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises for some time and we are not sure what is out there. 
 The easment was sent off for recording, but I have not recieved the recorded copy from the county yet.  As soons as I receive it, I will forward to John.

 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement and the Trailblazer PA Assignment Agreement. The documents have been revised to reflect the amendment to Transaction No.1 to increase the DCQ by 6, 195 MMBtu per day.  A few other cleanup changes were also made.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. (713) 853-3512. 
 Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?  If so did they recommend this specific language? 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Attached are redlined and clean CSA and Gas side agreement.  Please review. I am going to make further refinements over the weekend before we send to Drew. 
 Can't I say Hello to Mandy without a specific reason for doing so?  Actually, you copied me on a joke email earlier in the week.  Just thought I would see if you would talk to me.      Mandy.Bowles@email.moore.com 12/15/2000 01:50 PM

 Please replace the prior version of the capacity release with the attached version.  I found a typo.  In the 5th line of the Section 2.1, the number was incorrect. 
 For the sake of completeness, attached is clean and redlined version the amended and restated Transaction No. 2 Confirm which goes along with the Capacity Release and Trailblazer Assignment docs. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined revised capacity release agreement.  The WIC capacity numbers were revised to reflect the fuel calculation.  The prior numbers were inaccurate.  Please disregard the prior version and substitute the attached. 
 Mark,  I reviewed the contracts for whether the gathering fees are charged on an Mcf vs MMBtu basis.  The following are what the contracts state:  Beartooth - MMBtu Crescendo - Mcf D&G Roustabout - MMBtu Hallwood - MMBtu LoneMountain/Premier - MMBtu National Fuels - MMBtu Northstar - MMBtu Tom Brown - Based on their stated intent to renegotiate Trend- MMBtu Wasatch - Not stated in contract.  Rate is as Wildhorse adjusts from month to month Venoco - MMBtu  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  Where are we on this? 
 Jack,  Attached is the Release, Settlement, and Termination agreement we discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the final version.  Please forward to Black Hills. 
 Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming it is our standard form.  I will check this.  Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if it ultimately ended up at state facilities?      Lauri A Allen 12/19/2000 10:57 AM 
 I'll check the Global Database to see if I can find it.  Did Shonnie paper that purchase agreement?      Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 12/19/2000 06:20 PM 
 Lauri,  I reviewed the contract with TGLO.  It is a standard interruptible form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows.  I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract.    We feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts.  Thus, we would consider HISD to not be state facilities.  This argument is not a slam dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.  The contract also refers to gas "destined" for state facilities.  So the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter.  It ultimately is "destined" for state facilities. 
 Thanks for the note.  I am also glad we got to know each other this year.  We will have to make time to hang out next year, now that your LSAT is over.  Have fun in Denver and be careful of who you hang out with up there.  Merry Christmas, Gerald     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 12/20/2000 08:50 AM

 Brant,  The following are my responses;  1.  We don't have a problem removing fax notice as long as they are willing to leave the required termination notice at 5 days.  Since we can't fax notice, we will have to mail such notice which will take several days.  2.  We can remove affiliate assignment.  Sorry about the delay.       Brant Reves 12/15/2000 10:22 AM

 Larry,  I am OK with the form and Robert's changes, except that the proper name is Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC.  No periods after the LLC.  Everything else looks fine. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is the clean and redlined revised Capacity Release and Assignment Agreement.  I changed the notification to require that Calpine give us notice and that we would attempt to negotiate with the pipelines to arrange an alternative to the notice.  Please review. 
 Attached is a clean and redline of the revised confirm. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is a further revision of the Capacity Release Doc.  The comments are from counsel in the Calgary office.  All the comments are consistent with the intent of the prior documents.  They mainly make the Canada section symmetric to the ENA section.  Please review.

 Nope.  Didn't piss me off.  I know how to interpret Mandy talk.   I just have been extremely busy.  Most of the other attorneys are gone and I am catching all their overflow.

 Attached is latest version - due to quick turnaround, there may be a few typo's.  Julie, Gerald and I will be present. Talk to you then.... 
 Please review and let me know your thoughts on their comments.  The MAC section will come out, so disregard those comments. 
 Attached please find revisions per our conference call. Excluding all but one, we made Enfolio changes proposed by Michael. Our only deviation was to delete article 4.2,  sec vii, re: MAC.  Based on your QUICK feedback, we will send execution documents electronically so Janet can initial.  Please call me at Gerald's office if you have any questions.  Regards,  Stephanie 
 Per Janet's request. 
 Attached for your review is the final form of assignment.  The only change from the prior version is that the Renewal Notice section was changed to reflect that ECC will renew unless Calpine notifies ECC otherwise.  This was a point negotiate with Calpine.  We plan on executing these tommorrow morning. 
 Attached are the executables.  Please note the a redline of the Capacity Release and Assignment Agreement is also included.  I cleaned up references to the Renewal Notification (which are now the Non-Renewal Notification) that were missed earlier in Article 3 and Article 5.  Please note the Exhibit D of the Enfolio Master also needs to be signed by Calpine. 
 Thanks for your help and quick response on those comments.      Greg Johnston 12/29/2000 10:45 AM 
 Brant,  Attached is a clean and redlined guaranty with the changes we agreed upon.  We still need Hess' address for the notice section.  Sorry about the delay. 
 Dwight,  Attached is a form O&M Agreement that was recently used on power project in the US.  This form is very similar to the one you forwarded Steve, but is more detailed in the Scope of Services to be performed.  There are performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output.  We would have to add the steam output.  Should be very similar.  I think this form can be turned around to Coogentrix fairly quickly once we establish what the performance standards to be met are.  I will be out of the office on Jan.2 but will be back on Wednesday.  Please review.  I apologize for not getting back with you yesterday or today, but unfortunately the Calpine capacity assignment has to be signed today and it has consumed my time.  Thanks 
 Brian,  Mark forward the executed docs. to me.  The Trailblazer Assignment was not included.  I have attached the assignment in case you don't have the one I forwarded earlier.  Please execute and return.   Also the Amended and Restated Transaction No. 2 was initialled, but was not executed.  I am forwarding those back to you for execution.  Thanks for your cooperation. 
 Ken,  Attached is the form of compressor site lease agreement.  Please forward to all appropriate ROW agents.  This will be the form for screw compressor stations only.  The recips. will be a fee simple purchase and that form will follow shortly. 
 Robin,  Attached is the revised letter.  I added that Enron North America Corp.  was performing these efforts.  (If an entity other than ENA has the contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the proper entity.  I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from Citgo.  Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to demand cover.  I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy to Gordonsville.  I am going to be leaving, but you can call my cell phone if you have any questions.  (281) 772-9250.

Hope you had a great Christmas and New Years and were able to enjoy some time off.  I spent most of it up here working.  The workload has been incredible.  Take care, Gerald 
 For your review. 
 Attached is a very rough draft of the O&M Agreement based on our discussions.   There are several blanks concerning the numbers and I have noted several questions thoughout the agreement that need further clarification.  I am okay with sending this to the operator with the caveat that although the general substance of the agreement is in place, there may be some further changes to the language after further review.  Please review.

The remaining term is being released to Calpine.  The Capacity Release was just posted and should be completed by Jan 31, 2001.   I don't have a copy of the contract, but Stephanie Miller could provide that if needed.  It is a standard FTS-1tariff form.  This transport also backs the Canadian Producer Net Back deals.

 Hi Kristi, =20  Hope 2001 is treating you well so far.  We might be interested in the Flowe= r=20 Garden trip.  What is the price for these trips? 
 Based on the current draft of the O&M agreement, we do have the ability to (i) terminate each agreement for a one time fee of $200,000, or (ii) suspend all or a portion of the O&M services for a period of time and the parties would then meet to determine a mutually agreeable adjustment to the then current Operating Fee.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Attached are my comments to the TBI proposal.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.    I also wanted to clarify a point on the Tom Brown form of gathering agreement.  The revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage dedication.  Since Tom Brown removed all the acreage dedication language, it is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage dedication.  To the extent we modeled our economics on any Tom Brown production, I wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by Tom Brown to someone else at their discretion. 
 Per your voice mail, attached is the TBI proposal as revised. 
 For Gathering Agreement  Add to definitions  Interruptible - The term "interruptible" as used herein means that Gatherer, in its sole and unfettered discretion, shall have the right to interrupt, curtail or suspend the receipt, transportation or delivery of Gas hereunder at any time and from time to time without any liability to Shipper by reason thereof.  For PSA Agreement  Add to end of Section 4.01(b) and (d) - , except for Purchaser's receipt of written approval of all members of Crescendo Energy, LLC as set forth in Section 7.03(d) Add to beginning of Section 4.01(c) -  Subject to Purchaser's receipt of written approval of all members of Crescendo Energy, LLC as set forth in Section 7.03(d)  Add as Section 7.03(d) - Purchaser's receipt of written approval of all members of Crescendo Energy, LLC.

 Hey Ernie,  Hope you are not working too hard.  Wanted to check and see if you were planning on attending GT's bachelor party.  If so you can catch a ride with me.  I am planning on driving in Saturday and coming back sometime Sunday. Let me know if you interested. 
 Attached is the bilateral form of CA. 
 Staci's latest on the CSA.  Please review. 
 That is unbelievable.  Make you really stop and think and put things in perspective.  I am planning on coming in for the game.  Probably Friday night since the game is earlier than last time.  Let me know what you schedule looks like. Later. 
 E,   I will probably leave about noon or shortly thereafter on Sat. probably return about the same on Sun.     "Zavaleta, Ernie" <Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com> 02/14/2001 10:33 AM

 Thanks for grossing me out.  Have a good one also!    Lisa Nemec 02/14/2001 02:04 PM 
 Please use the attached credit sheet from Russell to prepare a new Master with AEC. 
 for your review.  Gulf is trying to file this by Friday.  Let's talk tomorrow. 
 Susan,  Attached is the draft petition.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Mark,  Attached are drafts of the confirms.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Pat,  As you probably guessed, I won't be able to make it on the trip. Sounds like fun, but work schedule and funds availability wouldn't allow for it. Sorry to be so delinquent in getting back to you.  I appreciate the invite and lets keep in touch.   Are you keeping Mark in line these days?       Patricia_Cuero@Dell.com 02/02/2001 02:30 PM 
 Russell,  Attached is the new master.  I have asked Debra to prepare the letter agreement to move all existing transactions to this new master. 
 Attached is the form of master agreement which I sent to you earlier today. Please forward to AEC to facilitate their review.  I have highlighted the sections that are different from the existing master in place with AEC.  I did not have the original 97 agreement on word document so I simply highlighted those sections. 
 Attached is a revised petition which includes the section of ECS' discussions with WFEC.  Please review.  I sending out this draft for the sake of saving time without review by my clients and am asking them to review as well.  I assume the next step is for Jeff to revise the conclusion with the bullets points and circulate a final draft for everyone's review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Thanks for your help. 
 Did get delivered to you the first time. 
 Attached is the document with both Susan's and my comments.  Please incorporate into your final draft. 
 Hey EZ,  Paul's number is 760-510-8090.  I haven't called him yet but need to. Yea it was good to hang out with you again this weekend.  I did look up that Acura on the internet .  Looks interesting.  We'll have to give her a test drive.  Later, G 
 I have received and will begin my review.  When can I expect the coal hauling contract.     Bill White <billwhite@mvalaw.com> 02/15/2001 03:50 PM 
 Ernie,  That sounds cool.  Do you need credit card to book?  I checked out the Acura sites.  Vehicle looks pretty sweet.      Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com 02/20/2001 03:00 PM 
 That address should be correct.  Try this one:  bieraugel@efortress.com  It should also work.     Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com 02/20/2001 03:53 PM 
 Pat,  Please print hard copies of these for me.  Thanks. 
 Attached are the Enfolio and GISB Spot Contracts.  Let's discuss. 
 Did you make it to work ok this morning?  I am extremely because somebody kept me up late last night. Not that I am complaining.  Probably not going to do some of my finest work today.  Seriously, I had a great time last night.  Gerald 
 FYI 
 Staci,  Attached is the final draft of the petition we are jointly filing with Gulf Power Company.  The plan is to file it tomorrow in Tallahassee.  I will get with you shortly on finalizing the CSA amendments. 
 Mark,  Attached is the confirm for the Nymex.  I revised it to reference the new master to be signed this month. 
 Mark,  Attached is the confirm with my revisions. 
 Mark,  Attached is the revised confirm.  I added a provision which requires AEC to execute a new master as soon as reasonably possibly and upon such execution this TA and all TA's between AEC and ENA in place will be governed by the new Master.  Let me know if that meets your understanding. 
 That's disgusting.     Brian Hendon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 02/22/2001 03:16 PM 
 Per Chris' phone call attached are the suggested changes to the side letter. 
 Please disregard the version sent earlier.  I inadvertently failed to remove the language in the ( ).  Please use this version. 
 Sunni,  Attached is our form of construction agreement.  Exhibit C still needs to be completed by us as we will be providing materials.  Exhibit D needs to be completed by Mountain West.  I will Fedex the execution originals tommorrow.  Let me know if you have any questions.  (713) 853-3512 
 Per our discussion.

 --- Per Mark Whitt's request I am forward our Enfolio Master Spot Contract and the Confirm with the deal details. 
 Pat,  Please print these documents out and fax to Art McMullen at (403) 234 - 7540.  Please put a note on the fax that I had tried to email to him the docs. at amcmullen@canscot.com but it bounced it back to me as undeliverable. 
 Still not sure you actually work at Cox Comm.  since you haven't emailed from that address and my email didn't go through!  I had better do some more background checks.     bswaldrop@aol.com 02/23/2001 07:24 AM 
 Mark,  Attached is a draft of the CMS Letter Agreement.  Please review and lets discuss.  I am not sure I have the correct CMS entity. 
 Attached is the form. 
 Stephanie,  I reviewed the Confid. Agreement.  The attached riders need to be added to the agreement and the term should not exceed 2 years.  Let me know if you want to discuss or have questions. 
 Testing.  Testing.  This is a test of the Waldrop email systems.  This is only a test.  If this were a real email, there would be a much more meaningful and heartfelt message contained herein.      "Waldrop, Barbara (CBI-Houston)" <Barbara.Waldrop@cox.com> 02/23/2001 11:27 AM 
 Mark,  I talked with Jeff Stone this morning concerning the petition.  The petition did not get filed on Friday as planned.  Jeff had left for Tallahassee prior to the FEDEX arriving on Friday morning.  They also wanted to have Katz-Kutter (our counsel in Fla.) sign the transmittal letter for the petition prior to sending.  This way the petition is sent by the customer and not the utility.  Bill Bryant at Katz-Kutter was unavailable Fri.  Jeff assured me that they will get this filed today.  I asked him to call me once filed.  We need to start thinking about the best way to approach WFEC after this petition is filed.  It sounds like Alabama Electric Cooperative is the way to approach this.  Do we know someone in our power trading group who works with AEC?   Might be useful to approach it through that relationship. 
 Ernie,  How is it going?  Did you have a good weekend?  I actually had to work for part of it, so my weekend wasn't all that great.  Were you able to book a room for me?  Wanted to be sure that was taken care of.     Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com 02/20/2001 03:50 PM 
 Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting into Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281) 772-9250. If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't you just call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll ride over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.  My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The wedding is at 7.  Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.  G      Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com 02/26/2001 12:09 PM 
 Andrew,  Attached is a rough draft of the CSA.  I am still reviewing the version, but it is substantially correct.  In the interest of time I am forwarding this for your review.  Please note Section 3.4.  I am a little concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint.  I am trying to find local counsel in Pa to review this section.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Mark,  Please review my attached change to the confirm.  This makes it clear that if we don't like their changes to the Master we will not accept them and the existing Master still governs.  If acceptable I will forward back to AEC.  Russell,  AEC is reviewing the Master and indicated they would have comments within a week or so.  The plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up with the new master.  The credit language that was in the earlier version has been removed. 
 I know.  It seems as though Mr. Rudy is in love, so damned the consequences!!  How are you doing?  Work treating you okay?  How is the law school application going?     Janel Guerrero@ENRON 02/27/2001 10:07 AM 
 GT,  Do you know if Clifton is in Houston or near home?  MD Anderson is here so I thought he might be in Houston. 
 My Dearest Barbara,  I long for the time when I can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and lose myself in your innate beauty.  The sheer black leather rockies revealing your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which I can call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles. Sigh!!!!!!!  I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly possible.  For who can think of work when one so lovely as Barbara awaits.  I can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms. Waldrop from those two known as Steve and Gina, and we will abound on towards fate.  Perchance it might be best for Barbara to come seek me out, as I am adrift without direction to the place where Steve and Gina reside.  Yours truly, Gerald     bswaldrop@aol.com 02/27/2001 02:03 PM 
 I am doing well.  Staying busy with work as usual.  Wow, your new job sounds like fun.  I wouldn't mind going to NYC once in a while.  I am around next week.  Maybe we could grab lunch or a happy later next week.  Let's talk early next week.      Janel Guerrero@ENRON 02/27/2001 11:47 AM 
 Ann,  Attached is the confirm with revisions.  I tweaked the language to make it clear that the transaction is governed by the existing master until we get the new one executed.  Please review and if OK, I can prepare executables for signature.  Please keep me updated on the status of the review of the new master.  Thanks. 
 Please review Section 7.3 and 7.4 closely.    I will be sending the revised LOI shortly. 
 7:00 pm is fine and I knew you still had a thing for David.     bswaldrop@aol.com 02/27/2001 03:20 PM 
 Andrew,  Attached is the form of LOI for your review. 
 Mike,  I never did receive a executed copy of the Master and Transaction Agreement between EES and Enron Compression Services Company.  Do you have a copy and could you send it to me? 
 Jeff,  At this point we are considering approaching WFEC and AEC to discuss this with them.  Do you see any potential pitfalls from your side with doing so?      "Stone, Jeff A." <JASTONE@southernco.com> 02/28/2001 07:31 AM

 Hey Dena,  Thanks for accompanying me to lunch today.  I really enjoyed our conversation.  You are very charming.  The rest of this week is pretty crazy and I am going to Austin for my friends wedding this weekend, but would you be interested in getting some dinner sometime next week?  Maybe Wed. or Thursday evening?  Gerald 
 That's fine.  Actually I really need to catch up on my sleep and my Napster downloading.  Have fun with your friends and I'll chill out at my crib. Yes,  my face has taken a beating in recent months.  Tell Casey I will live.      bswaldrop@aol.com 02/28/2001 04:15 PM 
 Andrew,  Attached is the CSA.  I added some language in the HP-hour Charge section concerning the minimums.  I wasn't able to download the spreadsheet into the doc.  I think it needs to be formatted into word and my assistant is not here today.  We can just print out the excel file and attach for now. Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Did you ever receive these documents?  If so, I need the originals. 
 Ann,  I am going to FEDEX the Transaction Agreement to you for sig.  What is your address? 
 Oops.  I just found the address on the TA.  I will just FEDEX there. 
 I will probably get to the casa about 9:00 pm.  Check out the attached.  Not sure if you heard, but K-State's President published a letter in which he called UT a bunch of wealthy arrogant Texans.  The attached is in response. See ya tonite.    - mastercard_UT.jpg 
 Mark,  Do you have these documents? 
 David,  Could you please review the following agreement.  Specifically Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.  ReUse will be providing ash handling services under this agreement.  This same agreement will be used for both Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.  These are the power plants in the Alamac transaction.  We are looking at replacing the existing Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Tyrell,  Not sure if you sent this out yet, but if you didn't;  In the disclaimer section - the second sentence refers to "Buyer".  This needs to be changed to Enron North America Corp.      Tyrell Harrison@ENRON 03/01/2001 11:15 AM 
 Attached is the form of CA.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ha  Ha Ha.  I forgot.  No need for the attitude though.      ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 03/02/2001 10:56 AM 
 Yes,  the "or something" part.  Did Gillaspie tell you were are going to Lil Woodrows for suds after work today?    ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 03/02/2001 01:05 PM 
 I have tentatively set up a 2:00 central time conference call with Bill Bryant to discuss sitting down with the staff of PSC to discuss our petition.  Are you available at this time?

 Brant,  Attached are the form of the JV Cinergy Guaranties.  I will route the ENA for signature.  Please note Section 2.  I made these JV guaranties secondary to the Bridgeline Guaranty.  Is March 1, 2000, the correct effective date for these. 
 Debra,  We need to prepare a spot purchase master and confirm for the following deal.  Please let me know if their is any further information that you need.  I don't believe they have an existing master spot, but we should check this. Thanks.

 Hi Dena,  Hope you had a good weekend.  I went to Austin for my friends wedding.  Got to see a lot of old friends that I haven't seen in a while, so that was cool.  Sounds like your pretty busy these days.  I can understand that with the transition moving forward.  Lunch would be great.  I am open later this week or early next week.  Let me know what you schedule looks like.  Gerald     Dena Pawlowski@ENRON 03/02/2001 11:09 AM 
 Attached are the Master Enfolio Spot and the Transaction Agreement for the North Finn, LLC transaction.  Please review and if acceptable, forward to North Finn for execution. 
 FYI,  Haven't reviewed it yet, but here is the latest. 
 Nick,  Attached is the form of services agreement.  The form is a little different than Steve Van Hooser's original form.  This a form that we used in Wyoming which I modified to fit this context.  I will prepare the tasking letter based on your scope of work and forward shortly.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the form of fee simple purchase agreement that we will use for the reciprocating compressor sites.  Please forward to all appropriate land personnel. If you have any questions please call me at your convenience. 
 How is your day going?  Generally manageable around here.  One of the assistants found out I used to be an Iron Maiden fan (technically, I still am)  and brought me an old Iron Maiden poster.  Boy is that going to look good in the house.  I know this is really impressing you.  Talk at ya later, G$ 
 Attached is the tasking letter based on the scope of work you provided. Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 The change if fine.  We also need to add the completion date for the services in  Part I Section 3.  I left it blank since I did not have that information.      Nick Cocavessis@ENRON 03/07/2001 10:50 AM 
 Attached are the Professional Services Agreement and the associated Tasking Letter.  Please review. 
 I went to the floor with the intention of checking this guy out, but when I got there I felt stupid and didn't really feel the need to pursue that.  I am actually sorry I mentioned it to you.  Insensitive on my part.  It is not a huge concern to me at this point.  How is your day going?  Have you gone out of your way to talk to Cynthia yet?      bswaldrop@aol.com 03/07/2001 12:57 PM 
 FYI 
 Staci,  Attached is the CSA with my comments redlined.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 I would include language which also obligates Calpine to take assignment of the Precedent Agreement with Kern and any associated firm transport contracts and to meet Kern's credit requirements in doing so.  I would propose the following in addition to the Guarantee language;  Calpine agrees to satisfy any requirements of Kern River and execute any and all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate, as of the Closing, the permanent assignment/release  from Enron North America Corp. to Calpine of (i) that certain Precedent Agreement for Firm Transportation Service between Enron North America Corp. and Kern River dated _______, 2001 (the "Precedent Agreement") and/or (ii) any firm transportation agreements entered into in accordance with the Precedent Agreement ((i) and (ii) collectively referred to as the "Kern Transport") such that Kern River (a) agrees to look solely to Calpine for all obligations with respect to the Kern Transport and (b) unconditionally releases ENA from all obligations for demand/reservation charges, and all other charges related to the Kern Transport.  Obviously there is still the risk that if Calpine doesn't close or meet Kern River's credit requirements, then ENA is still left holding this contract. If you have any question, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.      Ron Coker@ENRON 03/07/2001 07:17 PM 
 Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Sounds good.  I let Eric know.  He's not sure if he will make it, but oh well, I gave him the invite.  Are you still cranking away at work?  Kicking butt and taking names.     bswaldrop@aol.com 03/08/2001 10:41 AM 
 Attached are the following forms:  1.  Pipeline ROW 2.  Compressor Site Lease (for Screws) 3.  Compressor Site Purchase (for Recips)  I am distributing these for the sake of completeness. You may have already received theses forms. 
 I am still working through these comments.  Let me know what you think. 
 Ann,  I have received your comments to the Enfolio and will review them. Have you received the confirms for the Transaction and executed yet? 
 Stephanie,  I made on small change.    Also attached is the Assignment agreement for Kern River. 
 It is going fine so far!  We'll see about the rest of the day.  Eric and I tried a new burger place for lunch.  I was bad and had a cheeseburger con fries.  Now I am struggling to even stay awake.  Nap. Nap.  Any idea on your ETA at Woodrow's this evening? 
 Two words about my after work activities.  Proper Pumpitude!!  I have to work that cheeseburger off.  Why don't I call you on your cell when I get showered up and if your already past mi casa or at the bar, I will just meet you there.  Sound good?       bswaldrop@aol.com 03/08/2001 02:12 PM 
 Chris,  Attached is the form of CA for Power Engineers, Inc.  Let  me know if you have any qeustions. 
 Please print these on Enron logo only letterhead.  Need to create a header for Enron Compression Services Company on these documents. 
 Attached is the information of Barbara's friend. Happy hunting.  I give you a call later about Satellite.  Work-713-560-8065 Cell-713-498-2423 
 Paul,  Attached is a resume of a gas trader that is looking for a job at Enron.  David knows her, but I don't.  Any idea's on who needs to see this or if Enron is even interested in higher more traders? 
 Attached are the revised drafts.  Please note the following:  1.  I revised the FERC language but haven't yet talked to Drew about this concept.  He is in Houston somewhere and I have a call in to him.  2.  The Equivalent HP concept was removed.  Thus a Force Majeure or Utility interruption event will interuppt the Compression Services Charge.  3.  Please review the unwind language carefully in the Conversion Agreement.  4.  I added an arbitration provision.  This is standard in ENA or affiliate contracts.  The O&M form will follow shortly. 
 FYI,  Seems like the number is getting bigger and there may still be more numbers out there.  Let's discuss. 
 Shut Up!!     Paul.Pfeffer@bakerbotts.com 03/11/2001 04:32 PM 
 I'll be here all week.  Let me know when you receive the letter.     Chris Meyer 03/12/2001 08:24 AM

 Please see the attached revision per our phone discussion this morning.  If acceptable please fax executed CA to (713) 646-3490. 
 Kay,  Do we have a Confidentiality Agreement in place with this entity? 
 Terry,  Attached is a typical form that was executed.   Specifically Section 3.3 under which we will be curtail are takes from the Producers and any requirements to take pro rata from producers in Wyoming.  Thanks.  Any possibility of getting feedback by tommorrow.  Thanks. 
 Russell,  I am still reviewing.  We are light this week on attorney's due to spring break and I am catching a lot of overflow.  I will try to get through it as soon as possible.      Russell Diamond/ENRON@enronXgate 03/13/2001 09:10 AM 
 Brant,  Attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised Credit Services Agreement with Bridgeline.  I made significant revisions to this document. In general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide a more detailed deal arrangement.  Please review  and if credit is OK, I am fine to send this to Bridgeline.  Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.  The agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the services.  Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee? Need to establish this before we send out to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 You are so cool.  I can't believe that the person in that picture with the biggest rock band of all time, was in my bed last night.  Wow!  Everyday I found something out that just makes me want you more and more!  Ha Ha Ha  How is Ms. Barbara doing today?  I am weary from the pile of other people's projects couched on top of my head but "I will survive, Hey Hey".  I've lost the edge Maverick,  I am holding on too tight! 
 Attached is a rough draft of the O&M Agreement 
 In case you are not on your work email. 
 Rock and Roll!!!!!!! 
 Jean,  FYI, I have faxed the executed CA back to Entergy concerning Highland Energy.  They should be good to move forward with discussion.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
 I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump. First of all,  you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the market) and now you already discussing new ventures.  Secondly, Monkey Pump is not a stepping stone.  We are big time and those has beens "Quiet Riot" will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.  I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the Music: Monkey Pump episode.  "Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago.  When we return on behind the music............" 
 Eric and I will discuss this and get back with you.  In the meantime we had better not see you at any photo ops with Poison or Warrant. 
 Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is rough.    Some issues to note:  1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would, but it is a risk.  2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release at max rate.  3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more substance though.  Lets discuss. 
 Attached for your review is a draft letter for third parties whom with we plan to participate in the Kern River Open Season.  Barry asked that I forward to you as well for review. 
 Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).  This might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your voice mail to Steve.  The company is Design Technics Corp.  Phone: (713) 460-2291.  The map will generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro level. 
 Mary,  Attached is the list.  Let me know if you run into any problems. 
 Attached are a clean and redline version of the Gallup CSA and Conversion Agreement for your review. 
 Tyrell,  I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of  the letter agreement and your cover letter.  Please review.  As I noted earlier, Barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market.  I have not been able to contact him yet.  So unless Mark and Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry.    Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form.  I have sent them an earlier version and I am copying them here.  I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available after that.  I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff.  I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term.  This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate.  Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate.    We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment. Probably need to discuss this with Mark. 
 Do you have addresses and fax numbers for these counterparties?      Tyrell Harrison@ENRON 03/14/2001 08:28 PM 
 Attached is the latest draft for review.  We plan on convening and 8 am central time to review and finalize. 
 I should be talking to Barry in about 10 minutes, and we will probably have a few more changes. 
 Add these two to the list. 
 Here is one more. 
 Great.  Thanks for all your help on this.     Peter Keohane 03/15/2001 02:45 PM 
 I am booked currently on the following flights to NO.  Leaving Houston:  Flight 1257 at 5:05 pm Leaving New Orleans:  Flight 1364 at 2:50 pm. 
 Brant,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised agreement per our discussion 
 Yes,  I am alive.  Got in a little late, but still here nonetheless.  Deblah who?  I am checking to see if anybody is up for tonight and I should know later this afternoon.  I know we really need to have more drinks, its been so long.  Yes, I was serious about China.  Talked to Eric this morning and they would leave on June 6 and return on June 16.  I need to make sure this works with my work schedule.  I think it would be really cool to see Bejing, the Great Wall, etc............... and hone my skills as Show Lin High Priest Martial Arts badass......      bswaldrop@aol.com 03/16/2001 10:04 AM 
 John,  Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.  The following items of note were revised.  1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty. Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the transport, I am not sure why this matters.  2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest language in the guaranty was removed.  Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 1.  Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.  Producers were required to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit on the capacity.  Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA capacity stake on this expansion.  The basis is currently very profitable between Wyoming and California.  Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt  2.  Enron Compression Services - StageCoach  - Negotiating a deal to provide HP Compression Services to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in Pennsylvania. Drafts have been sent to Tennessee.  Also negotiating a power and gas deal with EES to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to EES which ECS receives from Tennessee. 
 Ken,  Attached are the Medusa docs with some slight revision.  The revisions are all to make it clear that this is a nonbinding proposal.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Debra,  This is another one for a Master Firm/Purchase Sale.  The Enron entity in these deals is Bridgeline Gas Marketing, LLC  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Here is the last one. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is a the form of assignment that we would use for the Kern River expansion with the producer.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Could you print these out for me.  Thanks. 
 Andrew,  Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS and its accompany Transaction Agreement.  I think it does make sense to have a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power and gas sides.  Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.  I will contact Bo and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.   Please review the attached documents and let me know before you send this to EES.  As you will see I have a few question noted on the TA. 
 How is it going?  I didn't get here until about 9:20.  Yikes.  I had 6 voicemail messages, when I got here.  Help. 
 Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.    Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think about this.  It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks. 
 Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed as this is no longer part of the deal. 
 Ken,  I am forwarding the initialed cover letter with the changes included. Please revise the body of the proposal to also reflect the changes made to the cover sheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.       Ken Loch@ENRON 03/20/2001 02:51 PM 
 That's fine.  Actually my friend Paul called me and wanted to get together for a beer tonight with Andy, so it looks like I will be blowing off working out.  Uh-oh.  That sounds fine.  Tell Shannon hello at the movies.  Ha Ha just kidding :-O.  Can't wait to hear your skiiillz on the radio.      bswaldrop@aol.com 03/20/2001 03:33 PM 
 I couldn't have said it better myself.      Brian Hendon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 03/20/2001 01:41 PM 
 Please review the attached response to the PSC for accuracy.  Let me know if you have any issues. 
 Gnny,  Please see the bold sentence I added.  Wanted to make it clear that there would be no double interest.  Let me know if that works for you.  I have left a voicemail with Enron Corp. counsel to review this and the other items we discussed yesterday.  Hopefully we can get this settled today. Thanks.

 Some thoughts that might help from time to time.  This was forwarded to me, and I found it very compelling.  G   Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has  been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what  we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've  been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait  for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark  day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. There are moments  in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to  make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. Please send this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or  another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship. And if you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message. 
 Just wanted to pass this on to you.  It was great to see you again the other day.  Take care. 
 Rusty,  Attached is a blank form for use in the E&I work.  The Work Offer form for the other contracts should be attached as an Exhibit to the other contracts.  If it is not, let me know. 
 Interesting!  Did she say why she was trying to call you at home?  I don't care if you tell where you have been, unless you think it would make things awkard between you. Probably not a good idea overall though.      bswaldrop@aol.com 03/21/2001 04:05 PM 
 Sorry,  I should have gone up to gas control this morning when I had still had the shakes.       Paul.Pfeffer@bakerbotts.com 03/21/2001 04:17 PM 
 That sounds good.  Let talk in the am.      Paul.Pfeffer@bakerbotts.com 03/21/2001 04:29 PM 
 Ann,  I have completed the review of the comments to the Enfolio.  It might make the most sense to discuss these over the phone to get quicker resolution.  Are you available tommorrow afternoon to discuss the comments.    "Crawford, Ann" <AnnCrawford@aec.ca> 03/21/2001 11:37 AM 
 Attached is a draft of the letter for Phillips Petroleum  that we discussed today.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Clement,  The form of Kern River guaranty is attached at the end of this email.    This is the form we would use for both the ENA bid and the 5 other third parties who have submitted bid on behalf of ENA.   Please review. 
 That sound cool.  I will schedule it up.    "Laura Gammell" <lauragammell@hotmail.com> 03/21/2001 11:58 AM 
 Would it be possible to do this call tomorrow afternoon?  About 1:30 or 2:00 central time.  My morning is a little tight.    "Crawford, Ann" <AnnCrawford@aec.ca> 03/22/2001 12:26 PM 
 Linda,  Arthur Anderson is conducted an audit of the subject entity and needs to obtain sign off from ENA Counsel that there is no pending litigation against this entity.  ECS Compression Company, LLC is owned approximately 10% by Enron Compression Services Company, which is 100% owned by ENA.  Attached is the form letter they want us to provide.  Can you review any issues with this LLC and have Richard Sanders sign off on this letter?  The letter needs to go to Jennifer Staton, who can be contacted at the cc email address.  Let me know if you need my help or have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached for review is a draft of the Gallup O&M Agreement. 
 Julie,  Steve forwarded your phone concerning the GTC for EOL transportation capacity.   Attached is the GTC I prepared for the EOL capacity release product.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 FYI,  Forgot to cc you on this. 
 Heather,  Attached is the ash handling agreement with revisions.  Please review.   I will be forwarding the coal handling agreement shortly.  The changes should be similar.    Redline of this document will follow. 
 Attached is the redline of the Ash Agreement. 
 Heather,  Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.  I made a few further changes to the Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Both docs do have a few questions inserted where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Thanks for the review.  A more formal response is not necessary at this time.      "Daniel Clearfield" <dclearfield@wolfblock.com> 03/23/2001 12:04 PM

 Jordan,  Attached is the latest structure.  This is still subject to change as AA has not yet approved.  The deal basically involves creating a new entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and associated contracts which ECT currently owns.  The compressor motor drivers are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority (NTUA).  ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in exchange for $$ and MMBtus.  Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.  This is a 2nd Quarter deal.  Would you expect anything less?  Please let me know who will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions. Thanks. 
 Attached are a clean and redline version of the revised docs.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a little early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a good time on Friday night?  How is everything going?  It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights last week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of the new car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points on Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.  Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of him since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.      "Zavaleta, Ernie" <Ernie.J.Zavaleta@fritolay.com> 03/23/2001 03:18 PM 
 How was the big weekend in Vegas?  I usually don't have to much luck at gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.  Did you win any money on the fight?  I had a blast the last time I went.  We stayed at the Paris hotel. Very nice.  All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did get a little tiring though. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is the form for the Hunt to Misako assignment. 
 Attached is clean and redlined version of the Misako letter agreement with revisions.  Please review and if ok have Misako execute. 
 Please see attached.  I added an agreement by Hunt to assign their PA to Misako. 
 Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on your credit worksheet.  I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 I'll be there at 7:00.  Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be late.  Around 8:00.  She likely just meet us for drinks.  Is that a problem?      "Laura Gammell" <lauragammell@hotmail.com> 03/26/2001 12:56 PM 
 How is it going?  Did you survive the honeymoon? 
 Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation agreement.  We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the Company's execution of the transportation agreements.  Please  review and let me know if you have questions. 
 That's fine.  I don't think we had anything planned for Thursday.      "Laura Gammell" <lauragammell@hotmail.com> 03/27/2001 11:27 AM 
 What do you need from me?  It is not clear from your note. 
 Ginny,  Please see the attached guaranty.  A clean and redlined version are attached.  I revised the language based on our discussions and added the language concerning interest which we had both previously approved.  We are OK to execute this form.  Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and execute.  Thanks. 
 These look fine to me.  Go ahead and forward to Brant if you are ready.      Debra Perlingiere 03/27/2001 01:58 PM

 Dutch,  Attached is a draft GTC for the storage product we discussed.  Please review.  There are a few areas in the doc. which I have highlighted for question.  The business terms probably need to be flushed out a little more. I would be happy to discuss this with the appropriate individuals at your convenience.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Russell,  I reviewed this with our business guys and they were fine with what you represent here.  We did not check this with Tom Balcerowiz and he needs to take a look at it.  Have your technical people gotten with Tom yet on any of these issues?  If not then we can run it down on this end.  Our only concern was that reliability between Gulf's 230 kv system and AEC's 115 kv system was not addressed.  It was our understanding that this was a question of the PSC staff.  Are there plans to provide any information concerning this item, or is no information available from AEC for such assessment?  Any word concerning WFEC's response to our petition or any filings they have made with the PSC?      "Russell A. Badders" <rab@beggslane.com> 03/21/2001 09:35 AM 
 Darren,   Please prepare a credit ticket for Sierra Pacific Power Company. Per Russell Diamonds request, I am forwarding this to your attention. Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Darren,  Since the Master is an old vintage, we are amending to reflect the current version and specifically any credit revisions that are necessary. The old master was only set up for 6 month or less term deals with volumes of 15,000 MMBtu or less.       Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 03/28/2001 04:02 PM 
 Give me a call. 
 Ken,  I made a few tweaks.  Attached are the revised docs.

 Barry,  Attached is a draft of the confirm for the Sierra Deal.  This confirm reflect only the volumes related to Package Two.  The confirm for package one would be indentical to this one with term and volumes revised.  As we discussed this confirm, does not reflect the revisions needed to the existing master.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 Debra,  Darren Should be sending you two credit tickets for these entities. I will prepare the confirms for the Nevada Power Co. Master.   Thanks. 
 Barry,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement for both Sierra Pacific and Nevada.  If you are OK with these, we can foward to them for their review. As soon you provide any comments on the Transaction Agreement, I can finalize them under the Nevada Power master agreement. 
 FYI. 
 I will be attending.      jennifer.m.erich@exxonmobil.com 03/29/2001 03:57 PM 
 We can go ahead and prepare the termination letter, but it looks like Cheryl has some issues to flush out before we officialy terminate that tower lease. 
 How bout them Horns? Give me a call when you get a chance. 
 Barry,  Attached are both confirms for the Nevada Power master with the changes we discussed yesterday.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward Nevada Power.    I am also re-attaching the Masters for both Sierra and Nevada.  No changes were made to the masters. 
 Have you guys received any information from Gulf Power concerning regular updates on the construction?  Jeff indicated that Gulf would be willing to provide updates monthly.  If we haven't heard from Gulf, we need to push them to provide this info. 
 Please see the attached.    John,  I think the only other issue was inserting the reference to Paragraph 6 in both Paragraphs 8 and 9.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Per your notes. 
 Barbara, The attached doc. contains a comparison of Houston Law Firm pay for associates.  This chart has the base salary only without any bonuses included.  I pulled this from FindLaw.com.  Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss. 
 Eggcellent!!!  Yes, I did have your watch.  However, due to lean times on the Nemec ranch, I was forced to see what the cash equivalent of your watch would be.  Does $10 sound fair.  Anyway I took the ten bucks, which thankfully acounted for both my beers last night.   Chalk up another one to the Nemec leisure activity fund.

 Attached are the contracts for the Kennedy and Quantum excess gas purchase. The confirms will be signed by the parties and governed by the GTC.  The attached GTC is the same for both confirms.  Note the Exhibit A to each confirm is not attached.  I will simply take the well listing Exhibit's from the existing long term contracts to create these new exhibits.

 We lightened the tone significantly.  Let's discuss. 
 Please replace the prior version with these.  I added some Wyoming Royalty Statute language in both confirms.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Ken,  I have read through the agreement.  I think this agreement need some fairly significant revisions.  It is extremely one-sided as currently written.  I will write up my comments and get those to you early next week.    "Ken" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 04/06/2001 11:22 AM Please respond to kckrisa 
 Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being served from Transmission Service.  1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer. Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.  2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even if there was no usage of power by Customer.  If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward these  to you for signature.  Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss. 
 Barry,  Attached is the form of assignment that we can use for assignment of all the Transportation Agreement to ENA.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Please hold these until Barbara Gray has reviewed the limitation of liability language  Thanks. 
 Darren,  Per our discussion, attached are the confirms for the Nevada Power transaction for the Firm GTC in lieu of the master.  After review, lets discuss the credit provisions we need to insert into the GTC. 
 Barry,  Attached is the GTC form without any revisions for any credit language.  Darren will be getting back with me shortly on the credit issues. 
 Julie is checking with Kern and the modification to their assignment agreement and whether they will prepare the assignments.  If I am to prepare the assignments I will need the Transportation Service Agreement information (volume, contract #, contract date)  for each shipper.    Barry Tycholiz@ENRON 04/09/2001 03:49 PM 
 Linda,  I have reviewed the form of Master Construction Agreement and have approved its use in this project.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. 
 Per your voice mail. 
 Julie,  The attached spreadsheet contains all the parties and volumes, but I am still missing some contract numbers.  The Denver office is trying to round up that info.  Kern probably has all the contract numbers and could fill those in. 
 The attached schedule has all the contract numbers.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 The agreements look ok.

 Hi Mom,  Hope everything is going well.  Sorry to hear about the relatives. I am doing fine.  Staying busy with work.  I am scheduling a trip to China in June.  My friend Eric's has a brother who lives in China and is getting married to a Chinese national.  He invited me along, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to see a part of the world that I likely would not otherwise see.  We will be going from June 4 through June 16.  Flying into the city of Shanghai and from there going to a smaller town called Qingdao.  The wedding will take place in Qingdao.  Should be interesting to experience a Chinese wedding.  We will then go to Beijing for sightseeing.  Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Great Wall etc.    Should be a great experience.  My roommate will be moving out in a couple of weeks and is getting married May 5 in Des Moines, Iowa.  I will going up for the wedding.  Take care and talk to you later.

 AP--  In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 playing recruiting "catch-up", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state wide out  Delmer Shanks  As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the "Opossum" set of OU's daunting new offense. "The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year", Shanks explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart. "In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up out with 2 or 3 of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, and then the center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand off to either me or the quarterback.". When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the season, a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to say. "Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be sponsoring OU athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I really liked what they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring they're putting on everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also gonna do some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon pies and stuff at the door." Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools before his commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed interest in him all along. "Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be the year they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with their high power pro-style attack". It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision some. A laughing Shanks explains, "Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come hollering outside...said Stoops promised her I would wear #8 at OU. We all been Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans for a long time, so we seen the importance of what they was saying. They don't honor you like that OU unless they done taken a real liking to you." As the interview came to a close, Shanks had this to say, "Keep an eye on us, cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next year. We got 11 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna go out on pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the quarterback. Boomer Sooner." Only time will tell if schools like Texas, Nebraska and others can keep up with Stoops and his amazing program. 
 Tyrell,  Attached is the letter amendment revised to reflect payment of Payment Two on Jan. 4, 2002 as well.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter agreement:  1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The "Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures" only are the method by which this is effected.  This change needs to be removed.  2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK. Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already agreed.  3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create a firm purchase deal with this letter.  4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from "that quantity of Gas..... to.......... (the "Released Gas"" should be removed.  The term Released Gas is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in this letter.   I am OK with ENA "hereby" agreeing to waive any and all rights it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA "may" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.  If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with Phillips, I would be happy to do so. 
 Paul,  Attached are the Greeley Docs.  They include:  Master Firm Enfolio Confirmation to Enfolio Letter Agreement governing the Transport and Storage Arrangements  Please forward to the appropriate persons at Greeley.

 Chris,  Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and Enron South America.  Please review and forward any comments you have. There is an existing Confid. Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 21, 2002.  The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.  Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under Chilean law?  We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.  Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions. 
 FYI  Attached is the draft gas agreement I had forwarded to EES earlier.  I did not receive a response. 
 Attached is the assignment.

 D-Rock,  Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.  I have noted a couple of areas where I still have questions.  One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.  We need to discuss this one tommorrow.  I will shout out at ya tommorrow.  The Artist 
 Per Barry's request.

 Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Let me address your topics one by one:  1. That is fine, except that no guaranties regarding the condition of your entertainment center can be made for the duration of your stay.  What day are you planning on moving? 2.  I have only received one piece of mail within the last week, so I think it is mostly working. 3.  Eric's local  - Egillaspie@coral-energy.com  (713) 230-3576 4.  No calls 5.  Sounds good.  Sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up, we both have been running somewhere when we ran into each other at the house.  Sat. nite I think the Gillaspie's wanted to go to Sambuca's downtown.  Thought I might join them.  Might want to check with Eric to see what's up.  Peace,  G$      ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 05/25/2001 07:51 AM 
 Wanted to make sure you had the latest docs.  I discussed with Barry and the MDDQ section was not changed since this version. 
 The importance of all long term plans to build a comfortable life faded away into cloud of apathy and listfulness.  No cares anymore.  Just extract as much as possible from each experience never knowing where it might take you. Wow.  Such thought before used to scare the hell out of you.  But isn't it ironic to finally find out no matter how much you try to control each aspect of your existence, it could end up somewhere completely unforeseeable anyway.  You have no control.  No control.  So why try to control it.  Why not open yourself up to all those unknowns, those risks, those potential great failures. 
 You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did you?  In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.  I will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.  Any chance I could get you to drop buy every couple of days and pick up my newspaper and mail and put them inside?  Would appreciate it.  I pay her $50 per visit and she comes every two weeks.  Not a bad deal.  G$     ryan.ruppert@exxonmobil.com 05/29/2001 10:56 AM 
 Ken,  Attached is the Northwest Pipeline FA with my comments incorporated. I have attached both a clean and a redlined version.  Please note that I added a cap to the total facilities costs.  This is a recommendation.  To the extent we have no cap however,  Crescendo is at risk for all costs they incur.  Cost overruns could be significant.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Barry,  I added a some language to th disclaimer.

 Attached is the revised Agency Agreement per our discussion and your notes. A clean and redlined version are provided.  Please review. 
 FYI 
 Please see the attached memo. 
 Per Barry's request, attached is the Agency and Management Services Agreement to be executed between Enron North America Corp. and Mexicana De Cobre.  Also attached is the form of agency agreement to be attached as Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services Agreement.  This agency agreement is El Paso's form and must be executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El Paso.  The El Paso form requires that you open as a read only file. Please review.    We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.  We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Gerald Nemec
