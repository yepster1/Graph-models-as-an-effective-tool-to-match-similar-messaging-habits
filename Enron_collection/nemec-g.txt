 Jim, I am not sure who handled the operating permits.  I think that type of stuff was usually handled by someone in the gas pipeline group. 
 Cindy,  Attached is the revised confirm with my changes redlined.  Let me know if this covers Nelson's concerns. 
 Please see attached.  Thanks in advance. 
 Sorry to bug you, but I have one more. 
 Kay,  Please see the attached.  I also forwarded a Data sheet earlier on Marathon Oil.  Have you had a chance to review yet? 
 Please see attached.  Thanks. 
  Kay, Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see attached. 
 Kay,  Please see the attached. 
 Sorry about the delay.  I have just been covered up.  Here it is. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is the executable form of the guaranty.  Please fill in the Cargill information and forward to Bridgeline for execution.  Also, I didn't know what the effective date should be.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Enfolio Master for the Ocean transaction.  The redline reflects the changes from the original draft.  Also attached is a clean version of the Transaction Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Ocean for their review. 
 Jeff,  Attached is the redline from your earlier revisions. 
 Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues. 
 Russell,  The data you requested last week concerning the motor is as follows:  1.  Full Load MVA rating:  11.4 for each unit 2.  Across the line starting MVA:  43.8 for each unit 3.  Input Voltage:  12 KVA 
 Hey Walter,  Thanks for stopping and leaving the note.  I'm glad I got to know you at the happy hours.  We will have to schedule another Gallant Knight evening sometime soon.  Good luck to you as well.  Take care. 
 I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip? 
  I am fine with the change.  Mary, please prepare executables and make the change in the NUI document as well. 
 GT,  I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.  My friend who was going to go back out.  It is yours if you want to use it.  Let me know. 
    GT,  I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.  My friend who was going to go back out.  It is yours if you want to use it.  Let me know. 
  The contracts for the notice letters. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:  1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap. 2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.  I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.  Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration. 
 FYI 
 Rudwell,  Attached is the guaranty with my comments redlined.  Please review and forward.  If you have any questions, please call me at x-33512. 
 Attached is the Burlington guaranty with my comments.  I was unable to redline the doc.  Computer problems.  I am forwarding the clean version.  Hopefully Burlington can redline against the draft they sent. 
 Ned,  I am fine with all of their changes.  Attached is a clean version reflects their changes.  Ask them to print out two copies and execute. 
 Frank,  Attached for your review is a draft of the settlement agreement we discussed. 
 Attached is the letter.  The address information and Unocal's full name need to be inserted and then print two copies on ENA letterhead for execution. 
 I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further. 
 Frank,  Attached is the letter with the revised Section 2.  I also added some language to the beginning of Section 5 to make it clear how that Section operates with Section 2. 
 David,  Attached is the document with the insurance mark-ups that I noted on my voice mail.  Please review and lets discuss. 
 Extension of Kennedy Wyoming Gas Purchase. FYI 
 Frank, I made a few tweaks.  Please review. 
 Gary,  Can you give me a scope of the issues we need to address in this CA.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the some of amendment info we discussed last week.  Looks like they want to get this out this week. 
 It will be in 38C1 beginning at 11 am CT tommorrow. 
 Per Gary Bryan's request, attached is a Confidentiality Agreement form for your review. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare CA for the following entities.  Black Diamond should be bi-lateral and Shell needs to be unilateral (i.e. only protects us).  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Shane,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted Carlos Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp." is a note which should be stricken.  Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  Lastly,  the full legal name "Enron North America Corp." should be inserted in the agreement.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 New deal being negotiated. 
 Attached is the form of GTC Wellhead for use in the Torch Energy transaction. 
 Rakhi,  Attached is the letter with my revisions.  I would have Mr. Neyman sign the letter.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Our insurance contact is David Marshall.  His phone number is 713 853-6847. 
 Judy,  I added the language for the payment by wire transfer in Section 6. 
 Attached is your proposed language with my comments redlined.  Please review.  I would be happy to discuss.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 FYI,  We have one more outstanding issue.  I have given them our insurance expert (David Marshall) name so they can discuss their insurance comments directly. 
   Phil,  Can you send Tyrell the schedule that is to be attached as Appendix A? 
 Attached are the revisions I sent to John. 
 FYI,  New Huber deal being negotiated. 
 Debra,  Could you resend to Enfolio Spot Master to Mark?  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss.  Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?  Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal. 
 Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.  Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.  Some items to note:  1.  As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at Enron.  The current Enron Corp. policy requires approvals by: 1.  The President (or equivalent) of Enron North America Corp. 2.  General Counsel of ENA (Mark Haedicke) 3.  Executive VP, Corp. Development of Enron Corp. 4.  Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.  2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.  I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.  Let's discuss. 
 Hi Mom,  I am doing fine.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier.  Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.  I am staying busy with the usual stuff.  Talked to Sharon last week.  It sounds like she is getting really close to the time.  Another grandchild.  Are ya'll going up to Dallas shortly after the birth? 
 Rusty, Per Nick's request, attached is the form of professional services agreement we have used for Enron North America. 
 Max,  Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.  They revised the Collateral limits in Section 4.5.  Let me know your thoughts. 
 My username is P00502719 and password is 14369477. 
 I will put in on my calendar. 
 Andy,  I have a few comments.  Attached is a redline. 
 Ken,  Attached is your document with my comments. 
 fyi 
 Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.  Please review. 
 Hey GT,  When are you coming to H-town? 
 Attached for review are the draft template GTC and Confirm forms for the monthly wellhead and pooling point purchase business of ENA Upstream.  Please review and provide any comments you may have as soon as possible.  We would like to implement these templates for October business going forward.  Judy,  We need to discuss how the "Keep Whole" language used for the torch deal, should be incorporated into these forms for those deals with the negotiated Keep Whole.  Ellen, has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss. 
 It was very nice running into you also.  Banker, smanker.  G works hard for the money, so you had better treat him right.  What do you have going on this week?  Thurs. or Fri. after work would work.  (That sounds weird) 
 Attached is the precedent agreement with changes redlined.  I scanned their hardcopy.  I added that same outs that were included in the Momentum agreements, but I left the dates blank.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Let's discuss on Thursday. 
 Attached is the form of amendment to guaranty for Tractebel.  Do you know the $$ limits for signing authority for Bridgeline.  I.e. when do the management member have to sign a guaranty as opposed to Randy Curry? 
 FYI 
 I actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to Keith for him to review.  I think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer.  Do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents?  We will need to have one to finalize the documents. 
 Keith,  Please note the following changes for the Napoleonville warehouse s= ale docs.  I will call you to discuss further issue to getting this finaliz= ed. 
 John, The meeting is tomorrow at 2:00 in 30C2 
 Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.  I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.  Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues? 
 Thanks for your help on this! 
 I am fine with this form. 
 After this hearing staff makes a recommendation to the commission.  The commission decision should be issued in late Oct. or early Nov. 
 Ned,  Attached is the revised  CSI CA based on our discussion.  The non-compete provision is removed.  As we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our Confidential Information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ECS.  However, they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our Confidential Information. 
 Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!  Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer.  The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet? 
 Judy,  Attached are the Torch Docs redlined with my changes.  I also changed some the the title on Exhibit A. 
 Max,  Tyrell is attempting to set up a conference call with these guys for Monday afternoon.  He will get back to us with the details. 
 Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.  The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.  G$ 
 Overall I would give her a 5.  I would request her again. 
 Attached are the revised redlined docs. per our discussion.  Let me know if you need me to review these with Mariner's counsel. 
 Sometimes you just have to step up to the big leagues.  I actually didn't know how much that trash can costs.  The ex bought it.  It is stainless steel, not chrome. I will sell you mine for $90.  I will even Lysol it for you.   Congrats on your oversized chair with ottoman. 
 XX-Large.  Thanks. 
 Sorry,  Jean Mrha's assistant should have it. 
 No problem,  I thought it was a day game when said I would come in on Friday.  Enjoy your Fri.

 Mark,  Attached is a draft.  Please review and let's discuss before you send to Huber. 
 Judy,  I added the language for release by Mariner that we discussed.  I put a 3 day threshold in the language.  Please review and lets discuss.

 Hey Tracy,  Yes you are correct.  That is a fantastic picture of JJ.  Really miss that guy.  Young Frank doesn't seem to be enjoying the experience as much as Madeline.  Glad to hear things are going well for you guys.  All is good with me.  Not much new and exciting happening.  Thanks for the pics!

 Yes 
 Forgot to forward earlier.

 Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The rate sheet they provided would be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review.  I am ok to forward this to Power Engineers for their review. 
 Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they would prefer to terminate or void this contract.

 Mary,  Please prepare a draft bi-latieral CA with the following entity:  RealEnergy, Inc. 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 755 Los Angeles, California 90067  The topic of the CA should be information concerning a potential sale of natural gas and/or provision of transportation capacity for RealEnergy's distributive generation requirements in southern California.

 Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion. 
 Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:  Bay Gas Storage 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft Lease Agreement 3.  Draft O&M Agreement    Oakhill 1.  Draft CSA 2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.    Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks. 
 Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper.

 Stephanie,  I made a few changes.  Please review. 
 Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!  Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!  Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.  Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  Gerald 
  Re-sending.  Didn't go through the first time. 
  Resending,  Didn't go through the first time. 
  Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin? 
  Hey Ernie,  Have you been able to send email to Bieraugel?  I replied to the email address he sent, but I keep receiving undeliverable messages. 
 Darren, I will be meeting with Sandi in the morning to get a download.  I will get with you after that to assess where we need to go.  Thanks. 
 Nelson,  Attached is the Confirm and GTC for the deal with Devon.  Please review and if acceptable you can forward to Devon for review. 
  Please see attached. 
 We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.  Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?  Gerald 
 I have seen no progress.  I will call my contact again to inquire.  Any prodding you could provide through the credit dept. would be welcome. 
   I need a couple of CA for the following information.  The need to be bilateral agreements.  Please use the bi-lateral form, that you and I have used before.  The Enron entity is Enron Compression Services Company.  Ned will be sending a more detailed scope shortly and I will forward. Please come to me with any questions. 
  John,  Per our discussion, attached is a draft form of gathering agreement.  This form is a firm committed reserves gathering agreement. If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
  Mary,  Attached is further detail for the project descriptions for the two CAs I requested.  Please revise the CA to read "information in connection with sharing data relative to a potential electric compression project located approximately 3 miles west of Carthage, Texas in Panola, County".  Follow that form with the Duke CA as well.  Please prepare two executables of each.  Thanks for all your help. 
 Mary,  The CA form had ENA in the text.  Please make sure it is Enron Compression Services Company. 
  Janel,  How is it going?  I booked this flight for myself.  Talked to Bruce and he is trying to set up a beach house or in the alternative, rooms for us at the Sea Trail hotel.  Let me know if you want me to book a rental car for us to share.  G 
 Paul,  Attached are redlines of the confirms that were revised with the changes we discussed. 
 Mary,  Chris is the guy who called me asking the questions.  I have a call into Sandi to see if she knows anything about this.  If not, I don't know who would know. 
 Please disregard the prior version. 
 Brucie,  You weren't supposed to tell anybody about that!!  Maureen,  I am planning on setting up a rental car for Janel and myself and we can cut you in on that action.  Our flight leaves Myrtle Beach at 11:40 on Sunday so if you are leaving out of Myrtle Beach that might work for you also.  Gerald 
  FYI,  Attached is the form of lease agreement that Hanover has forwarded for our lease of the compression equipment from Hanover on the Oakhill deal.

 Sorry,  The number is 202-342-0800. 
 Dave,  Made a few slight tweaks. 
 Mary,  Is this an operational type filing or an entity type filing?  If it is operational, then it is probably someone else's issue. 
 Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of Oneok's form of guaranty with my comments incorporated.  Please forward to Oneok for their review.  I will prepare the executable form of Bridgeline Holdings, LP guaranty for Oneok per your email yesterday.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Sorry about the delay.  I had to figure out where the IT guy's had moved all this stuff when Shawna departed.  Let me know if you have questions. 
 If you can fit it in.  I am pretty covered with ENA Upstream right now. 
 Tried to send this earlier.  Will try again. 
 Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks. 
 I am going. 
 Attached are draft responses to WFEC requests for documents and request for interrogatories.  Please review and provide any input as soon as possible.  Thanks. 
 Please review and provide any input as soon as possible.  Bill,  I still have not talked with Jeff Stone. 
 Hey Dan,  Good to hear from you.  I am doing fine. Sounds like fun.  I will try to make it.  I might get caught up here at work though.  I am leaving the country on Thursday for 4 days, so I am trying to tie up some loose ends here.  All my stripper friends are not returning my calls for some reason!  Hmmph!!. 
 Bill made a few changes.  All of which I am OK with.  If these are OK with you, we will forward these to WFEC. 
 Bill,  The answers as modified by you are fine.  Please forward those to Mr. Haswell at your earliest convenience.  I have still not received any response from Jeff Stone. 
 Attached are draft agreements for both entities. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is a redline with my comments. 
 That is fine.  Go ahead and set it up. 
 Attached for your further handling is the confirm and GTC for the EEX E&P Company purchase by ENA Upstream.  Note that we need to have them sign the confirm, so we will need two executed originals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Please fill out the Data Sheet and send to Kay Young  Form of CA    Data Sheet Form

 Attached is a draft of the Confid. Agreement we discussed. 
 Brian,  Attached are drafts of the following docs.:  1.  Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement 2.  Transaction Agreement to the Master Enfolio  We are still undergoing some internal review of these, but to move the process forward please review the attached.

 Can you please send it to Jeff Hodge, since he initialed the orginal agreement.  Thanks. 
 Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.

 FYI 
 Judy,  Attached is the Pioneer Confirm.  Please insert all the relevant contact information.  Also please carefully review the confirm to make sure that I interpreted your email info. correctly.  I left a blank for the Field information.  I would ask the counterparty to fill in and return a copy to ENA Upstream. 
 Attached is a revised form of affidavit.  Please review and provide any comments asap. 
 Staci,  Attached is a draft of an affidavit the ECS is proposing to supply West Florida Electric Coop regarding an informal requests for documents that ECS received from WFEC.  Please review and lets discuss asap. 
 Susanne,  What is the status of the professional services agreement? 
 Staci,  Attached is the final form of affidavit.  We plan on emailing this version to WFEC's lawyer for review prior to execution.  Given the confidentiality provision in our CSA, could you please respond via email with FGT's approval of this disclosure.  Thanks. 
 Per my voicemail, attached is the master spot contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 
 Susanne,  Attached is a redlined agreement with the revision to Section 8.3 we discussed.  If acceptable, I will prepare two executables for routing.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached is the revised CA per my discussion with their attorney.  Please review and forward to Anadarko. 
 Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out. 
 Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare two separate CAs between Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Enron Compression Services Company.  You can use the bilateral form we normally use.  Rusk's information is  Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. P.O. Box 1169 Henderson, Texas 75653-1169  The scope for the two CAs is as follows:  1.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at OGS Pipeline, L.L.C.'s Hinkle Compressor Station"  2.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at Anadarko Energy Services Company's Carthage Facility"  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help! 
 Paul,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed which revises the Devon purchase docs to match the Gathering Agreement with Lost Creek.  Please review and let me know if you are OK.  If so, I can prepare the executables and Fedex to Devon. 
 Attached is the revised Ormat CA per your email.    Also, I don't have any notes on the Energy Transfer CA.  Sorry about that. 
 The drafts per our discussion. 
 Yes,  This looks to be a separate deal and mine was only a spot deal. 
 Based on our discussions yesterday, attached are the BHP Confirm and GTC.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  We still need to input the Delivery Point information. 
 Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.  Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA. 
 Chris,  I am fine with his revision if you are OK with the terms. 
 Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks. 
 Ellen,  Let's talk about this before you send out. 
 Sandi,  The following are the contracts that were inadvertantly assigned to AEP in the sale as we discussed.  Centana Intrastate Pipeline Co. 	#96019236 EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.  	#96006479 EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.	#96041930 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc.	#96041723 Gas Transmission TECO, Inc.	#96041724  Let me know your thoughts on the best way to proceed to return these deals to ENA.  Thanks.  Miss me?  Gerald 
 I already made that mistake once. 
 Larry,  The letter looks fine to me. 
 Raimund,  Attached is a form of amendment for both the Athens and Hartwell Precedent Agreement.  The amendment modifies the termination date as we discussed.  Two pieces of info that I left blank are the new date to be inserted and the date of execution of the original precedent agreements.  I do not have a copy of the dated executed PAs.  I do have a copy of the guaranties.  I will forward a copy to you.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Mary,  Can you please prepare executables of the attached document.  There are some redlined changes, all of which I am OK with.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you. 
 This deal was done some time ago.   I assume that all ENA Upstream deal makers going forward know they should be going through you. 
 Wasn't sure if you were copied on all this. 
 Attached is the CA for the project we discussed with NNG.  Let me know when you want executable agreements. 
 I don't want to know what Paul did in a hot tub with Lars.  I know he is easy, but jeez. 
 Might be too late, but attached are the letters with my revisions.  Let me know if you still need me to initial. 
 I am fine with this term sheet. 
 Attached is a draft of the McCook agreement.  I am still cleaning up the Management Services Agreement (for scheduling etc.) to be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review 
 Mark,  Could you please review the attached.  The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.  ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the Enron entity needing access.  The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.  Let me know if I am mistaken.  Thanks. 
 Revised per your voicemail. 
 Mark,  Attached are the latest.  I smoothed out some of your changes and added a section in the TA to address assignment of the gathering agreement.  Please review. 
 Judy,  Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.  Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.  Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.  Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.  Thanks. 
 I am fowarding the originals to you.  Please obtain execution for ENA Upstream and ENA and return them both to me.  Thanks. 
 Thanks for the quick turnaround on that.  Any word on when we can expect this to be set for hearing? 
 Attached is the revised draft based on Stephanie's comments.  Please review. 
 See my attached comments. 
 Mary,  Please forward me, via email, the two Rusk County Electric Cooperative Agreements you previously prepared for me.  Thanks. 
 Stephanie,  Attached is the revised agreement with my changes. 
 Attached are the revised CA's for the compression projects with Rusk County.  I have added Northeast Texas as a party to both agreements.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Revised per our discussion.  Please forward to Citizens. 
 With my revisions: 
 Nelson,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments  1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues. A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase". We would have to tie this down. C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.  3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity  In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper? 
 The term sheet looks fine. 
 I am sure I didn't do as good a job as Michael Keeton did! 
 Sorry to hear about Aunt Lillie.    Good to hear everything is ok with you guys.  Everything is going well here.  Just the usual with work and weekend activities.  Been spending a little more time with Paul, since he is not going to Tulsa every week.  Take care and a I love you both. 
 Hey E,  Good to hear from you again.  Not much new around here.  Working and partying.  Still trying to restock the girlfriend pipeline.  George's email is gtownsend@manorisd.net.  I haven't played any golf recently, but do like to play.  I am pretty horrible, but it is fun nonetheless.  I would definetly be up for a round some time. Let me know.  Have you been able to email Bieraugel at the last address he sent?  I have tried, but my emails keep getting bounced back to me. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the referenced agreement.  I will forward Exhibit A to the agreement shortly.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Count me in. 
 Please see attached. 
 Attached is the agreement revised per your notes. 
 Keith,  Attached are our comments and revisions.  Please review and let me know if you see any problems.  We would like to send this to the counterparty tommorrow, so please respond asap.  Thanks. 
 Nathan,  Can you describe where Encore compression is located? 
 Judy,  Attached is the GTC to be used for the Mariner deal with the revisions we discussed.  I will be out Thurs. and Fri. but will check voicemail. 
 Haven't heard anything on this deal. 
 Mary,  Can you prepare a CA based on the following information.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Brian, See the attached memo based on my review of the hurricane docs.  Nothing really different than what Bridgeline indicated in the meeting on Monday.  Let's discuss at your convenience. 
 Attached is the amendment form for the El Paso Guaranty.  Please forward to El Paso for their review.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Thanks for the info Mike.  I will give her a call.  I had a blast on Friday.  We'll have to do a happy hour again soon.  Maybe we can get the AEP girls to show up. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised doc per our discussion. 
 The latest. 
 Hey Sam,  Actually it comes out every weekend as much as I try to control it.  I had a great time.  We will have to do that again sometime! 
 Yes,  You can delete. 
 Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of  "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"  We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.  I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.  P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him. ;-)  Gerald 
 Keith,  Attached is the form PSA for the sale of the Napoleonville Lot and Warehouse we discussed.  LRCI, Inc. not Houston Pipe Line Company will be the selling Enron entity.  You should be receiving the appraisal that was prepared for the land today via Fedex.  Let me know if you have any questions.  (713) 853-3512. 
 Brent,  Please see the revised guaranty. 
 Do you have an address for these guys? 
 Attached is the template for the FM letter. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the draft letter.  Please review and let's discuss. 
 Jean,  For your review.  Specifically, the scope in the lead in paragraph. 
 Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Judy,  I will be working on that form next.  Should be ready tommorrow or Monday.  For the Linder dealer we can use the firm GTC with a modified DCQ.  I forwarded the language for the DCQ to Ellen. 
 Mark,  Please see attached. 
 Mark,  Attached are the latest. 
 John,  I have revised the variance language based on our discussion.  Please review. 
 Janette,  I plan on attending the CLE on August 22 at the Doubletree.  Thanks. 
 I am fine with the changes.  I revised the term from 1 year to 2 years.  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the CA.  I am OK to forward to Marathon. 
 Looks good. 
 Yes 
 Judy,  Let me visit with Jeff on the 6 month threshold for the Committed Reserves.  Otherwise I am OK with this Matrix. 
 Attached is a draft CA.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 We might want to forward this email version for their review first.  I would think that their attorney's might have a few comments. 
 Mark,  Made a few small comments.  See attached. 
 Joan,  Attached is the agency agreement form.  The form still refers to TBI Field Services.  This should be revised to reflect the current owner of the system.  Can you provide that info. 
 It is still on Chris Hilgert's desk.  I will bug him to get it back to you.  Sorry for the delay. 
 Paul,  Attached is the revised letter Agreement for Greeley.  Please review and if you are OK with it, please forward to Greeley.  They had asked that we drop the contract number references in the first paragraph, but we need to have some way of identifying the contracts under which we are acting as agent, so l kept them in the document.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 That sounds good.  Schedule it up with Majed. 
 Please use the attached GTC is place of the previously forwarded for all deals going forward. 
 Not anytime soon, but within the next couple of weeks. 
  Alan,  With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company, Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.  These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.  The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.  There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal.  Enron's general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month. I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 The only change is in Section 2.  I refer to the requirement to schedule the Daily Contract Quantity instead the Nomination. 
 Yea,  Things have changed quite a bit.  Life as usual at Enron. 
 Randy, For your information, I am forwarding you a summary of my review of the Bridgeline documents concerning the Texaco Sorrento cavern issues This summary was prepared on behalf of Enron. 
 Keegan please print two executables of the attached on Enron Logo Letterhead.  I need these this afternoon.  Thanks. 
 Fyi 
 Keegan, I think the attached is a Word Perfect File.  Can you try to convert this file to an MSWord file.  Thanks. 
 I have a conflict and will not be able to attend.  Let me know if there is any thing you need my help on. 
 Keith,  The attached document was blank.  Could you resend the document? 
 That sounds good.  We'll see you at 12 on Friday. 
 Paul,  Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the changes we discussed.  Please review and forward to Greeley for their review. 
 Attached is the draft that was provided to WFEC's counsel.  As I stated they have requested to depose ECS as well. 
 I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.  Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a hall pass from your better half. 
 Keith,  Attached is the revised PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse.  I removed the mineral rights reservations and added in the sales price.  Please review. The agreement needs to be forwarded for review by the Assumption Police Jury as follows:  Attn:  Kim Torres Assumption Parish Police Jury P.O. Box 524 Napoleonville, LA 70390  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is the redline version. 
 Attached is a draft of the mowing letter for Assumption Parish.  Please review.  The address needs to be added in Exhibit A.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 David Marshall (risk management, insurance group) will be the one to set the limits.  I usually send a copy of the agreement and ask for his comments.  I can handle once we get a draft of the agreement. 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Boeing Contract with my revisions.  Please review, specifically Section 4.2 and Article 7.  I want to make sure you are OK with those sections specifically.  Sorry for the delay on this. 
 Jean,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.

 Chris,  Richard and I have come to agreement on the Shell CA.  Attached is a redline with the changes.  Please forward to Shell for their review and I will send down executables. 
 Attached is a draft of the CA.  Please review.  I need the full legal name of Illinois Power. 
 There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.  There isn't too much towards Enron.  I don't mind going towards your building.  You have probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building. Good Italian. There is also a Cafe Express down there. I am OK with any of those.  Do you like Sushi?  There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center. 
 Let's discuss when you get a chance. 
 Sounds good.  I'll see you there. 
 Dave, How about tommorrow at 2 pm central.  Let me know. 
 Needs the facts filled in. 
 It was great talking with you at lunch.  I have never known a real life tap dancer before.  I feel honored.  I am outta here tomorrow, so have a great weekend. 
 Made a few slight revisions. 
 No problem.  Let it go. 
 Chris,  Attached is a form of interconnect agreement with reimbursement language that you requested on behalf of Hugh Connett.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 The entity should be LRCI, Inc.  You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Jean, Based on Richard's reply, I am OK with the strike.  I just wanted to make it clear that ENA does compete with Marathon is these areas, but ENA would certainly only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of the proposed Transactions.  Do you want me to prepare executables? 
  Mary,  Can you check to see if Jempy can sign for LRCI, Inc. and let Rakhi Israni know?  In the alternative, please provide her a copy of the corporate data sheet which list the VPs who can execute documents for LRCI. 
 Chris,  I need the project scopes as well.  Can you give me brief descriptions? 
 Keegan,  Please print out two originals of the attached CA for execution on ENA letterhead.  I will need to initial.  Thanks 
 Few comments. 
 I don't know the status of the Crawfish documents.  I will have to check.  Steve Van Hooser was handling those documents.  With respect to your previous question, the PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse went to the Assumption Parish last week. 
  Hey Jennifer,  How is it going? Did you survive your long run this weekend?  It has been pretty crazy here since I got back.  I really need to start focusing more on the guitar so I can become rich and famous and not have to deal with all this.  I am so tired. 
 The sections are 18 CFR Part 161.  Specifically Section 161.1, 161.2, and 161.3. 
 Alan,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of Enron's Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.    Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.  1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does. 2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters. 3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues. 4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters. 5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.  Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512. 
 Do you have any tiered pricing language for 5 tiers? 
 Attached is the revised Committed Reserves Confirm with the language we discussed.  Please modify the confirm templates for the Sept. wellhead deals (and those remaining from August) to reflect the revision.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Janette, To be more complete, the MS Word program Barbara and I were referring to on voicemail removes the Meta Data from the document. 
 Keegan,  Can you print the attached doc. on Enron Logo Only letterhead. This version had redlines, so you will need to accept the changes before printing. 
 Attached is a draft for your review.  Note that, Prior to giving any information received from Anadarko to CSI, we would need to get Anadarko's written permission. 
 They won't leave. 
 Shane,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language. 
 You can save it in my Confidentiality Agreements folder. 
 I added Section 5 - Non-Compete. 
 Ed, Can you help me out with this?  Kay is out of the office. 
 Attached is the agreement with my revisions. 
 I have not received it yet. 
 For your review, attached is a draft of the processing language for Riceland Ralco.  Please provide any comments you may have. 
 Please see attached and let me know if you have any comments or questions. 
 Mary,  Those will be fine for the other LRC entities. 
 The Parties shall keep the terms and provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential and shall not disclose them, in whole or in part without the written consent of the other Party.  If any Party shall be required by any court, legislative or administrative body to, whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, or some other processes, any Party shall have the full right and ability to disclose same without regard to the confidentiality covenant herein contained; provided, however, that such Party shall provide the other Parties with as much notice of its requirement to make such disclosure as is reasonably practicable and do all things that the other Parties may reasonably request, at the other Parties' cost, to facilitate the other Parties' efforts to eliminate or restrict such requirement. 
 Jeff,  Attached is the letter with a few comments.  The only substantive comment concerns cost tracking.  We would like to be informed of the overall project costs as they are incurred.  Please see the attached redlined doc. with my comments.  Let me know if Gulf is OK with these changes.  We would like to get this finalized early tomorrow morning.  Thanks. 
 The language looks fine to me. 
 LRCI, Inc. is fine with recording the map. 
 Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks. 
 Lisa,  I am fine with the changes.  Just insert the langauge into the confirm under the heading "Processing". 
 Let me know, how you want to handle this.

 Keegan's Info 
 I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following  1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000 3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.  Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.  2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40 Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)  Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.  3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500  I find no basis for this in the contract.   Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a draft of the Keep Whole language we discussed last week.  Please review and provide any comments you may have. 
 Deb,  Could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities:  Louisiana Resources Company LRCI, Inc. Louisiana Gas Marketing Company LGMI, Inc.  Thanks 
 Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues. 
 Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier. 
 I know how you feel.  No way Nebraska should be playing for the championship.  Should be Oregon. 
 I will see if we can get someone from the bankruptcy team for Wed. 
 Attached is the review performed so far on the gas contract list you forwarded.  I only reviewed the physical master from Barry's list.  The attached also included some contracts that Frank asked for review.  I will have more updates tomorrow. 
 Please send of future email updates to: gnemec@houston.rr.com 
 Leslie,  The technical name is:  Blanket Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 7C of the Natural Gas Act and 18 CFR 284.402. 
 Your thoughts? 
 Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:  All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name  1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.  2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.  No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.  Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.  Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements. 
 Karen,  Please get with Mary Ogden.  She can retrieve the schedules for you from our legal files.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a brief of these contracts.  I can help you work through the agreements if needed.  Thanks. 
 Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.  Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!  Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.  Let me know when you get some time.  G 
 Mark,  I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.  Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.  I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal. 
 I left it with Leslie after I reviewed yesterday. 
 I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight. 
 We found no termination notice. 
 Please see attached.  Please note that that physical gas purchase and sale is as follows:  ECS Compression Company LLC receives the gas from TW under the CSA ECS Compression Company LLC sells the gas to Enron Compression Services Company Enron Compression Services Company sells the gas to ENA (Gallup) or to Enron Gas Marketing Corp. (Bisti/Bloomfield) 
 I would like to nominate OU's 16-13 defeat by OSU as the Most Humiliating Upset of the Year. 
 At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.  We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.  Also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the Bankruptcy Ct. and the DIP financing.  I can look into it if it necessary, but does it really help the cash situation? 
 Susan,  Could you look for and email me the following:  Storage Agreement with Montana Power Interruptible Storage Agreement with WBI Transport Agreement with Trailblazer Pipeline Company (Think it was dated around 1995)  Sorry for the sketchy info, but that is all that I have.  Thanks. 
 Bruce,  Give me a call when you get a chance.  We have much to talk about in recruiting.  Let's see.......  Albert Hardy, Rodrique Wright, and now Marco Martin.  Unbelievable.  If we could only land Vincent Young. 
 Kellie,  Have you updated the transport list yet? 
  Here, Here,  I would like to second Ernie's sentiments.  We are very proud of you guys and hope that you stay safe.  Drop us a note if you can. 
 I still haven't received the final update.  This is the latest. 
 Do you have anything for HomeTown Communications Network.  Looking for a gas  contract dated 6/14/01 
 No.  This must be the Pulp & Paper GTC to which they are referring.  They didn't specifically note it as a gas deal.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached is the only I have for Kachina. 
 Thanks.  Could you also look for a Enfolio Master Firm with Kaztex Energy Management Inc. and ENA dated August 1, 2001. 
 Debra Perelingiere had prepared this contract.  Since it was done so recently, it may not have made it into the system yet. Thanks for your help.  I'll check Debra's files. 
 Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Service= s Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas u= nder its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company= .  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS deli= very of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA und= er a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been d= esperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipe= line worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Mark= eting, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in = the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,00= 0 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a l= ong term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (appro= ximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a = potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide= any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the cur= rent situation. 
 In addition to the Philadelphia Gas Works contracts, could you also look for a Husky Oil Operations Limited with ENA dated September 1, 1999.  Thanks. 
 Thanks Susan.  Can you send me any GTC that would have been for Nov -01 through March 02 business for PGW. 
 Per my phone conversation with Cheryl Hartsell, I hereby give permission for Unimark LLC to provide a copy of the contract with ENA Upstream Company, LLC dated October 20, 2001 to the producer who gas was sold by Unimark under such contract; provided that Unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract.  If you need any further information, please contact me at (713) 853-3512. 
 I did prepare these. 
  Per my phone conversation with Cheryl Hartsell, I hereby give permission for Unimark LLC to provide a copy of the contract with ENA Upstream Company, LLC dated October 20, 2001 to the producer who gas was sold by Unimark under such contract; provided that Unimark informs such producer of the confidential nature of the contract.  If you need any further information, please contact me at (713) 853-3512. 
 Attached is a draft of the Dow Amendment.  I used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of August 8.  Date and prices are left blank for negotiation.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Stuart,  I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.  Please review attached.  The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept:  1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.  2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are. 
 The only way would be to copyright the material.  Any original writing can be copyrighted.  At a minimum, I would mark any submission as Copyrighted material.  I don't know the specific requirements for filing.  You might want to do some net research on the subject.  I would think the Fed. Government would have a web site on how to copyright material.  Hope this helps. 
 Mark,  Attached for your review is a draft of the Capacity Release agreement we discussed. 
   Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Rakhi,  Attached is the form of cash sale for the Crawfish Property.  Please review and if OK you can forward to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Sorry.  I completely forgot. I will get you a check tomorrow.   Everything is going fine!  How are the law school plans going? 
 Ellen,  Let's talk about the attached. 
 Chris,  Attached is the info I have on this deal.  My contact info is:  Gerald Nemec Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith St. (EB3874A) Houston, TX 77002 
 Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.  They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.  Later. 
 Attached are the Mexicana Amendments and New Confirm.  Jason, As I left in my voicemail, I want to make sure you are OK with the credit provisions inserted into the GTC.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. 
 Attached is a new confirm I have prepared for Mexicana 
 Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work, her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts, washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes, bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there. A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.  G 
 Attached are the two contracts which will replace the single original, as we discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. 
 Revised per our discussion. 
 FYI,  Do we have any Peoples concerns here? 
 Attached are clean and redlined versions of the docs with revisions. 
 Attached is a clean version of the LOI.  I only revised what was paragraph 6.  I tried to redline, but it picked up all the previous changes. 
 I am OK with their changes, as long as you are OK with removal of those counterparties. 
 Bill,  Attached is the information we discussed.  I enjoyed talking with you today.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
 Keith is forwarding hard copies of the documents.  As soon as I recieve them, I will review, initial, and forward to you for execution. 
 Keegan,  Please print out two executables of the attached on bond paper.  Thanks. 
 Hey Ern,  Sorry it took me awhile to get back with you.  As you can imagine, it is pretty crazy around here.  Yes, it has been very interesting around Enron these days.  I think we pull through, but I expect the stock to take a beating for awhile.  The media has been pounding us for the last couple of weeks.  Saw George at the Colorado game.  Seems to be doing well.  George was definitely ready to get married, so I think he is really enjoying the married life.  Ran into a couple of old Wranglers including Carl Jackson.  Do you remember Kenny Reineger?  We saw him at the endzone club.  Also ran into Stacy......SAR!  She looks exactly the same.  Haven't heard anything from Bieraugel.  I sure he is up to his eyeballs busy with kickin some Taliban butt.  How is life at FritoLay.  The economy effecting you guys any? 
 Ken,  Attached is the Agreement with my comments redlined over your changes.  Sorry for the delay  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  By copy of this email, I am requesting David Marshall to review the insurance section (Section 11) and provide any comments he may have. 
 Keegan,  Please print out 6 executables of the following:   And 8 executables of the following:     Please FEDEX two original two each counterparty to the address listed in the contract.  Some counterparties are on both contracts, so they will recieve four originals for execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sorry for the delay on this Jill, I was out sick yesterday. 
 Thursday afternoon is better for me.  If it must be done Wed. please coordinate with my assistant Keegan Farrel 
 Attached is the LOI with my comments redlined.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
 Brian,  Attached are  the letter and Exhibit with my changes.  I have included a clean and redlined version.  Please review. 
 Attached is the draft. 
 Lisa,  I am fine with your changes.  The language that you highlighted in red should read "the Parties
