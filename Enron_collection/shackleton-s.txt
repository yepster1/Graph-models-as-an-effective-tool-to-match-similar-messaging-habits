 Won't you carve your deal out of the Threshold for your "Deemed ISDA"? 
 I'll be out of the office on Sept. 27 and 28. 
 Susan:  While Tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a "blank form Paragraph 13" for this master.  Just our standard.  Caveat:  subject to credit review even though there are blanks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  In case Global Finance is desparate in the next two days, I'm forwarding the project in this email and a following email.  Thanks.  Sara 
 2nd email.  Sara 
 Clint:  I spoke with Mike Collins [203-719-8385 (phone) and 203-719-7031 (fax)] who conrfirmed to me that the cap included the remaining 2.5+million remaining shares.  Please return an executed copy of confirm to me.  Thanks.  sara  My assistant Joanne Rozycki has cell, car numbers to reach me.  I'll be back on Monday.

 Thanks.  SS 
 Marie:  Can you please refresh my memory? Sara 
 Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - this impacts EOL trades; didn't know if you were aware of these issues. 
 I can wait; just didn't want it to slip through the cracks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here it is.  I'm fairly certain that Annabel said the assignment was fine and we'd execute when we got the Securities Lending Agreement done.  SS 
 FYI only 
 All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES. The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues. Who is currently responsible for this counterparty? Please respond.  Thanks for your help.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Sheila:  Please send your usual message on this one.  I assume it is for ECT Investments Inc. Thanks.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Please send your usual message on this one as well.  There are several written agreements involved.  Thanks.  Sara

 Sam, Marie and Stephanie:  Would you please finalize all Brokerage Agreements with entries identified as "Sent for execution"?   A fully executed agreement should reside in the red file.  Please have this completed prior to October 15.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Mark:  Can you please reply to (1) below? Also, any ideas for help with brokerage agreements? Thanks.  Sara 
 Clint:  Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.  It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.  Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.  Please verify with deal tickets.  I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.  Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).  I have Jim's comment for "material information".  Thanks.

 Marie:  Does this sound weird opening the account on Sept. 27?  I thought this was done some time ago. SS 
 Mark:  I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.  I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.  Thanks.

 Carol:  Susan and I are available anytime.  How about 9 am (since our trading meeting is at 11 am)?  Sara 
 Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.  There is some type of meeting this afternoon.  It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.  FYI - I was in  the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.  Sara 
 You need to send an email to Donna Lowry, Cassandra Schultz, William S. Bradford  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Tracy:  Please let us know when you have reached a conclusion.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.  Fred should try to negotiate this one.  I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m.  Kim is aware of this situation.

 Ed:  I received a message from the lawyer for Cinergy Energy Services requesting that the ENA ISDA be with CG&E.  This will solve our allocation issues (as the utility will hedge for its own account).  Please send a new credit worksheet.  Thanks.

 I need the city's bond counsel (outside counsel). 
 Stephanie:  Can you please ask Francisco or Anne to handle?  Thanks. 
 Rich:  I'm waiting to hear from credit.  Sara 
  FYI 
 fyi 
 We are going to do this at our own expense.  But we would like to hire Glendale's bond counsel.  I don't know the name of Glendale's bond counsel or how to get in touch with them. 
 Susan: I can't remember whether I asked you to send the proposed Par. 13 to Tanya (or maybe I asked my assistant).  Please remind me.  Thanks. 
 Tanya:  I think we sent the ENA ISDA to you but I'm going to refax since First Union is calling daily.  We sent them a "blank" Paragraph 13 and they are asking for credit terms.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Gil:  (1)  the BS&Co. confirm references the "Irrevocable Sell Order dated August 9, 2001".  Please forward a copy.  This apparently contains definitions for (multiple) Sell Order Execution Dates.  (2)  according to your notes, the BSIL "Standard Terms and Conditions of Business" is subject to review by a UK lawyer.  Please advise of your conclusions. Forward executed version (which is incorporated into the confirms).  (3)  the BS&Co. confirm references the Customer Agreement and incorporates this as a Credit Support Document.   Please forward executed verison.  [BS&Co. also claims that deals pursuant to your Customer Agreement are Specified Transactions for purposes of OTC derivative transactions]  (4)  portions of the confirm do not match the unexecuted Term Sheet which you gave me.  Was a Term Sheet executed?  Is there an ENE guaranty which is supposed to be a Credit Support Document under the confirm?

 Kim:  Sounds like you're confused.  ENA is requiring two opinions:  one from Glendale (inhouse) and another which we are paying for (Glendale's outside counsel)  Call me.  Please do not forward my messages to Glendale because we are now at cross purposes.  There is no need to alarm Glendale about our existing arrangements.  Sara 
 Gil:  Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

 Mark:  You never assigned this one.  Attached is the EOL list.  Chase merged with JP Morgan and we need to upgrade/select existing master. 
 Please forward your email requests to the RAC group for opening this account.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.  Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Tom:  There is no existing Enron company named "ECT Europe Investments Inc.".  We need the legal name of the company.  Also, does that company have existing resolutions for opening brokerage accounts? 
 Maria and Michael:  The form of confirmation of fine.  How would you like to handle execution of this transaction?  of remaining transactions?  Scheduling the VE discussion for later this week is also acceptable.  We look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.

 Can you please submit a new credit worksheet?  Thanks. 
 Maggie:  I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  (1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?  (2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)  (3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.  (4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?  (5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?  (6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:  "Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."  This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?  (6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."  (7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?  (8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained? 
 Per my voice mail 
 David:  Actually, Jeff and I have eliminated the "agency" issue.  Jeff proposed that ENA transact directly with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (the A rated utility).  Sara

 Ed:  Do you want legal to do anything at this point? Sara 
 Stewart:  Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.  Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.  Give me a call if you have a chance.  Thanks.

 Kim:  Is the legal entity for PacificCorp:	PacificCorp Power Marketing, Inc.?  Is there only an entity for financial power?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kathryn:  The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:  Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master) Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master) Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master) Ameren Energy (none) American Electric Service Power Corporation (none) PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)  The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.  Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Kim:  Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

 Tammy:  Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:  (1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.  (2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?  Please let me hear form you.

 Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only. 
 Russ:  The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.  Thanks.

 Sheila:  Just a few notes from the Agreement:  (1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin (2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA) (3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time" (4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please? (5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days? (6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation (7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades  Thanks.

 Jane: Jane:  I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.  I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts: (1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date (2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed (3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage). (4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format.  Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.  Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.  Regards.

 Tammy:  Thanks for the quick response.  Your "business day" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara 
 Darren: I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

 Rob:  Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.  I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.  FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.  I left a voice mail.  Let me know how you want to proceed.  Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.  Thanks.  Sara    Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.  We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.  Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:  (1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal  (2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.  (3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)  (4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's  (5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.  (6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral  (7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB  (8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC  Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Rebecca:  Per our conversation, attached please find Clorox's blackline.  You should have Aparna's file including the credit worksheet.  Also, Aparna should have provided you wtih a copy of the ISDA boilerplate (let me know if you need this or anything else).  The credit issues we should focus on include:  (1)  request for cross acceleration [Part 1(b) page 1] (2)  Cross Default amendment for operational issues [Part 1(b) page 1] (3)  Credit Event Upon Merger:  use of "materially weaker" definition [Part 1(c) pages 1-2] (4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3] (5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments] (6)  elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8] (7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9] (8)  Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1] (9)  complete change to Threshold and Independent Amount [Annex A pages 2-3] (10) "Minimum Transfer Amount" from $0 to $500,000 (11) elimination of the MAC in Par. 13 to the Credit Support Annex [Annex A page 8] (12)  Enron Corp. guaranty:  elimination of cap [see Enron Corp. guaranty]  I look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.

 How about Thursday at 10 am?  Sara 
 Kim:  A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these. 
 Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.  (1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?  (2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.  Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins. To date, we have only focused on:  ENA EPMI ENE ENA Upstream Company LLC `	EPMI  We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).  Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions).  Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Kim:  I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:  (1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations  (2)  Don't capitalize the word "party" in either version  (3)  Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version  (4)  Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version  When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.  Thanks.  Sara

 Rex, Jim and Clint:  You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001.  In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).  Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

 Kim Theriot can probably locate these confirms 
 Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

 Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?  (3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?

("Bear") in accounts for the following companies:  Enron North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]  ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]  Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]  I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.  ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.  We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 There is a Weil Gotshal lawyer in your office named Andrew Harting. (currently in a first floor conference room - 30101).  He and I just spoke about the Bear situation.  He will also assist with the Enron Credit Limited efforts to move ENA and ECI positions to London.  Please contact him and bring him up to date.  Then let's talk.

 These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.  Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?  Sara 
 Sam:  Please see me in the a.m.  We are going to use this party as a test case for valuation and will need to organize a binder now.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Just spoke with Cindy Ma who tells me that Wilbur Foster will be in Houston next Thurs/Fri.  She again says that Millbank is asking about our strategy for handling in the money gas swaps.  I know you guys are managing the EY relationship and I just wanted to let you know how she's bouncing.

 How about 9:30 on the 30th floor?  Sara 
 Will you please call Ty (whatever her name is)?  The reason being that their termination notice relates to the ISDA (I believe) which we do not have.  Thanks. 
 Nancy: I have forwarded this to Cynthia as part of the "intercompany contracts" review process.  Sara 
 I asked him if he knew of any hedge funds in TX or CA. 
 per our meeting 
 Call me.  Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment. 
 Here's an electronic verison of Tanya's 11/30/01 credit ag report 
 Ellen:  Did ENA close all positions?  How much margin was posted and has it been returned to an ENA account?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Alex:  The documents look fine.  I am having the waiver reviewed by our bankruptcy attorney and I have not yet received a response.  The signature blocks will change.  The U.S. Enron Entities will require a V.P. signature.  The U.K. entity has two directors. I'll touch base with you in the morning.  Thanks for your help.

 A few questions:  (1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?  (2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 No way.

 Cheryl:  Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?  Thanks.

 thanks 
 Ed:  I think this answers the question.  I know to research outstanding broker claims (e.g.,  BNP Paribas is witholding USD 80,000,000 to setoff against other claims).

 Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.  The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

 I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.  Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

 Sure; I think we can do that now.  I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.  However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.  Sara

 Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:  I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.  With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.  Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.  Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?  I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Alan:  We need Ed Smida's help with prioritizing the EGM in-the-money requests from Beth Apollo's group.  Beth is only focused on physical gas and power appearing on Don Miller's list.  Ed S. can really help me and PWC in bringing a small but discrete number of EGM parties to the top of the list.  Sara

 Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:  Goldman Sachs & Co.  Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.  I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.  We can discuss further at 2:30.

 Weezie:  Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have reviewed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.  Such counterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial product and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple reviews.

 Financial trading is just now gearing up to send these follow-up letters.  The few that have been sent have been incorporated into the counterparty files and logged onto the "Master Letter Log" which is updated by Stephanie Panus.  Sara 
 Becky:  can you please make an addition:  After the the termination value brackets, put a period and add:  "A valuation sheet is attahced."  Thanks.  Sara 
 Weezie: =20 =20 Thanks for the info.  There are some items that need to be corrected.  Let'= s discuss when you have a minute.  Sara 
 Mark:  I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.  Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara 
 Ed:   The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:  Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.  The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.  Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.  Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.  Sara 
 That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

 We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.  This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.  I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.  (1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate? (2)  Is this a single swap or several? (3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

 Louis:  Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.

 Scottie:  I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.  I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.  Sara

 You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.  What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.  Sara

 ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.  Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.  (1)  Louis/Mike:  (i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha. (ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.  (2)  Samantha:  When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.  (3)  Angelo:  If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.  Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.  Just copy me in case I receive a call.

 Brent:  I must have been reviewing something from this CP when I sent the message to Tanya.  Is Tanya right about having discussed this with you already?  I can't remember.  Sara 
 Ed:  Looks like Haedicke and Derrick are the sole directors and signers for this deal.  Both are in the office today. Can you please prepare a short memo summarizing deal and request for signatures for me to present to them?  I am not familiar with either the insurance contract or the credit derivatives. Thanks.

 Termination letter setting Termination Date as 1/25/02. Terminates the ISDA Master Agreement and deal nos. Y23821.1 and Y20976.1. ENA owes $604,957.62 and "calculations" are attached.

 I'll check out the Big B.R. forecast before I come in. 
 Lisa:  ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.  Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

 Bob and Tanya:  ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.  The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."  We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin?  Please call to discuss.

 yes, earlier this year (posted in the form of "up front collateral").

 Per my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).  This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.  Thanks, as usual.  Sara 
 Jonathan:  The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:  page 2	-	2.2 page 4	-	4.2 page 5	-	7.3 page 10	-	12.5 page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III) Page 18-	7.9  Also, I'm uncertain of the following:  page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright? page 17-	7.3	Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)? page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard? Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?  Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.  Sara 
 Sheila:  A few points:  (1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.  (2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.  (3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)  (4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?  (5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.  (6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?  (7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.  Thanks.

 I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.  ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.  Hope this helps.

 Jay and Tanya:  Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.  (1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]  (2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.  (3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.  (4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.  (5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.  On a different note,  (5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.  (6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.  (7)  The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc." and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.  QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?  Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

 Jim:  Please see attached.  Urgent.  Sara 
 thank you, thank you, thank you

 All:  Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.  ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate.  Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

 Gil:  Will you be handling the documentation?  Does JSB Asset, LLC have an authorized trader list? a resolution to open the account? 
 fyi - I don't have any idea if this will be routed in accordance with the "process" for ENA brokerage agreements  Do you care?  This is the second such brokerage agreement coming from Gil.  Sara 
 ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.  ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.  I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.  Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.

 Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

 Kim:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.  I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jorge:  The Confirmation which you faxed to me references the attached Exhibit A which is the original confirmation for Transaction 1980816.  Please send it to me.  Thanks.

 Jorge:  Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.  It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".  The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.  You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.  Please let me know if you have further questions.

 Tom:  I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.  Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty?  Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?  Please advise me and credit of the status.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rudwell:  You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.  Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?  Thanks.

 FYI 
 How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:  "The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."  The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.  Let me know what you think. Sara 
 Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].  Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.  Sara 
 Ellen:  Feel free to send the language.  I'm not sure Peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified.  And yes, I think it would be helpful if everyone discussed the changes and methodology ahead of time.  Sara

 All:  I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.  In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.  How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

 Hi, Mark:  ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:  "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."  Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?  I'd appreciate your insight.  Regards, Sara  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 David:  Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.  The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.  NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.  I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.  Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.  Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

I need the attachment which I have identified as merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).

 It's not at the top of my list.   Sorry. We'll have to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation.  SS 
 Mike:  An ISDA Master Agreement is currently in the works for Deseret.  Marie Heard is the paralegal and I'll probably take a look at the document.  Please bear with us as we have lost one of our attorneys and are swamped.  Thanks. Sara 
 I'm  busy today and tomorrow.  But I'll book up to 60 days in advance (like the French Laundry in Napa) for you.  SS 
 Brent:  sorry for my poor "attaching abilities."  Hopefully we will have a lot to discuss tomorrow.  Lynn has a suggested the use of a separate "action list" to present to Mike.  SS 
 The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.  The convention in the physical world (as I understand it) is that the seller sends its paper.  SS 
 By letter dated 3/9/00, Tembec Inc. has requested the transfer of "Contract No. EJ7774.1" dated 3/23/98 to the National Bank of Canada pursuant to Section 7 of the ISDA Master, to be effective April 1, 2000, but with Q1 payment to be made to Tembec.  We do have a master with the National Bank of Canada.  Please let us know if this transfer is approved.  SS 
 I received comments from Vintage (remember, no CSA).  With respect to Transfer, Vintage wants ENA to provide a guaranty of a transferee Affiliate's performance under the master.  Let me know your response, please.  Sara 
 Yes, offshore (ie, as ENA) with an onshore or offshore counterparty, as it desires.  SS 
 Whomever  would like to add to their list can see me.  Thanks.  SS 
 Here's the doc I want to save - 
 I've scheduled a meeting with Guy on March 30 
 I think you're the wonder woman of swapland.  Congrats.  SS 
 I know that we try to limit the provisions but we should consider:  1.  confidentiality (in the miscellaneous section, perhaps) 2.  setoff where there is no early termination date (is this covered by NY/TX state setoff laws?)  I'll try to meet with Carol and Shari next week to develop a list of issues/recommendations for you.  We may come up with more omnibus items.  SS 
 I think this should work for the group (including Mark and Shari) 
 What should I do with this?  SS 
 Please contact my assistant, Kaye Ellis @ 3-5968 about these changes.  Sara 
 I'll need help finalizing this (Flynn) Master.  Just let me know who can help on Monday.  Sara 
 major changes to Fixed Price and Additional Provisions 
 I read your language and I think its too vague.  You don't want to include existing risk management services. 
 For Monday 
 Did you ever receive any paperwork from this fund on behalf of Zachary?  How was NY?  Mother sure is talkative these days.  Hope all is well  Sass 
 Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).  Also, I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize our financial trading matrix.  I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly. 
 Could I please have a copy of the final?  SS 
 On March 9, Susan Flynn sent to Ing. Guillaume Rivron a memo regarding Process Agent (specifically, CT Corp.) and a form of certificate for Delivery of Documents.  This was copied to Martin Cassone and Julian Poole, both via fax.  Susan is out of the office most of this week.  SS 
 Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 1999.  Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara 
 We have been asked to assist in the setting up of an account with Morgan for the sale of this stock (through John Greene) held in the name of "Enron Communications Investments Corp.".  Restrictions (technically expired on 3/12/00) on the shares are in the process of being lifted by the transfer agent.  Let me know if you need further information. We are working with Mike Deville and Gill Melman (ECI legal).  Thanks.  Sara 
 forwarding instructions 
 Same question I just asked you.  SS ps  let me know if you can schedule Donna (excluding 2-3 pm) 
 Attached is Sara Shackleton's Report.    Kaye 
 I must be on a separate list because I do receive these clippings from A. Bueno.  Thanks.  SS 
 FYI - Southwestern Bell is installing equipment in my home on April 3.  They will call me 1 hour before arrival.  This is just a head's up that I may have to dash out sometime during the day.  SS 
 Attached is a sample "format" for summarizing swap group activity.  Please add your own activities and feel free to edit the sample.  Suggestions are welcome.  I'll edit responses in time  for our meeting next week.  Thanks. Sara 
 Of course it works!  Had lunch just now with Carson Llewellyn.  He's in private practice in Houston and said things had slowed down a bit here.  Have a great weekend.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Please review and call me. 
 Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the following two items:  (1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not sure which it is) that "financial institutions" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)  (2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?  Give my regards to Pablo.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara 
 attached is redrafted language which can "stand alone" or we can also incorporate the chart. (Jared, I think you have some prior language we can use, and we may have to rename one or two parts of the chart).  SS 
 OK, I have reviewed Lawhill  and AIG Funds.  Marie is making changes and the goal is to get blacklines of AIG to Rod today (since AIG has credit issues only).  The issues revolve around the Collateral Threshold and Letters fo Credit.  Lawhill will be ready for execution.  SS 
 Have you run your change past this guy or Morley? 
 Thanks for your message.  We are in the process of turning a blackline.  Sara 
 Please open new file "Project Spector"  (or Spectre?) and print the docs below.  Gareth Bahlman's assistant should know the name.  Thanks.  Sara 
 per our discussion 
 I thought there were 5 funds.  SS 
 Looks like nothing was ever done on this so I've contacted Tracy Ngo to move on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.  Do I need to call Holli?  Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on this?  Sara    Christian Yoder 
 I want to join.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Attached is a clean version which incorporates most of Brent's comments. Please read again.  Sara 
 Yeah.  Also, Clem wants to join us for sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Be careful.  Sara 
 We have been asked to set this entity up for financial trading.  It's part of our JV with Texaco.  Hal Bertram (X31865) is a good contact person if you have questions about the Bridgeline companies.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's the only info that I have on this counterparty.  Sara 
 please print 
 Credit is reviewing file and we are trying to determine whether this entity is "eligible" (for swap transactions).  I should know more soon.  Sara 
 Yao went back to Africa!  I think he'll return next week.  SS

 PLEASE DISREGARD THE DRAFT MEMO SENT ON 3/16/00.  I have reworked a new memo which prints on 3 pages and which I hope is brief and to the point.  Let's try to talk before Friday so that we can send the memo before then.  I still have not heard from Patricia Lopez.  SS 
 I have to leave the office at 10:30 to be at my home.  I should be back after lunch.  If you need to reach me, please feel free to call at (713) 664-3207. Thanks.  Sara 
 print redline for each and the following 
 I gave the Kevin the OK and he was going to prepare a waiver letter.  Our conversation was some time ago.  Sara 
 Can you please forward my report from last week and update the "week".  Also, change target date of Argentina report to this Friday.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll need you to standby for coordination (only) on: Ghost unwind Specter Hawaii 
 Statoil - use of multiproduct guaranty similar to one executed by parent/ENE Spinnaker - sent draft to you BP - I'll see what we have to do Basin - name of contact.  No such person as Bob Hall 
 Thanks! 
 I am interested in flying.  Sara 
 This is the "format" for the exhibit to change payment accounts from the CP to the bank 
 Please review assignment language Par 12 (C),(G) for accuracy. 
 Attached is the list that Marie had prepared for me just last week (the date at the top is incorrect) which is a good start.  We will still need a detailed description of the brokerage agreement process.  Sara 
 Attached is revised language to drop in the confirm.  John:  Please approve. Joe:  edit my margins AND does the preamble of the confirm use the word "Agreement" to define the Master Agreement?  THIS IS NOT AN ISDA! 
 Attached is the ESP definition taken from the commodities regulations. 
 I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is perhaps interested in ENA. 
 Just an example of "brokerage account stuff" that can occur with respect to a single account.  SS 
 I have three Canadian utilities almost ready to go; checking Canadian legal issues.  Sara 
 you are too good    Enron North America Corp. 
 John is the ONLY authorized trader for the Morgan account.  SS 
 OK - forget the prior list I sent!  It really WAS from 1998.  Attached is a real live current version which can be expanded.  Sara 
 Please follow up.  Also, we need to follow up with Chuck Gilbert (counsel for CP) for docs.  Thanks.  Sara 
 yes, I can attend    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second "Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar with this transaction.  Sara 
 Pablo:  I am forwarding this message that I send to Patricia last week.  She may be out of town or otherwise engaged.  Would it be possible for you (or someone else in the firm) to respond to my two questions?  I only need a short explanation.  If you need to reach me, my telephone is (713) 853-5620 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.  Thank you for your assistance.  Regards.  Sara 
 I received a message without further identification and I'm momentarily baffled.  Maybe the name rings a bell.  Thanks.  Sara 
 That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).  Regards. Sara 
 I'll send you a FedEX tonight with my seminar enclosures.  Thanks.  Sara 
 It was and my apologies.  Sara 
 We now need to appoint David Vitrella as an authorized trader for the ECIC account (per Ted's OK below).  Sara 
 The following transactions are happening this week and quarter end (as to Project Hawaii 125-0): Project Ghost unwind Project Spector (remaining Rhythms stock put into identical Ghost structure) Project Hawaii 125-0 (permanent structure to handle FASB -125 deals)  Rod:  I believe you looked at Ghost last year.  Let me know if you have any Spector issues. Bill and Rod:  I will send you summary terms for Project Hawaii 125-0. 
 Attached are summary documents.  I am in the process of reviewing the swap piece now.  Sara 
 HELP! 
 Patricia,  Sara is unable to open your attachment.  Could you please fax the information to her.  The fax number is 713-646-3490.  Thank you,  Kaye 
 let me know if this prints ok 
 I left a message yesterday for Chris Littlefield to schedule call.  I have not heard back.  SS 
 Don't worry 
 Per our discussion, please see attached.  Sara 
 Hi, Serge.  I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.  Paul Karns mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.  You can reach me via email or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.  I will be negotiating the agreement on behalf of ENA. 
 Please see attached.  SS 
 Per my voice mail, please add the following sentence after the two signature blocks:  The undersigned hereby guarantees the timely payment when due of the obligations of Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC under this Transaction and this Confirmation in an amount not to exceed U.S. $5,000,000.  BRIDGELINE GAS MARKETING LLC By:  Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. By:  Bridgeline LLC  P.S to Bob:  I am not certain of the signature line as I have not heard back from Barbara. 
 We have to respond to comments on the Credit Support Annex and a few items in the Schedule..  We are waiting for copies of standing  PUC orders from PG&E (addressing derivatives issues) as well as a blackline of the Schedule since PG&E controls the drafting.  Sara 
 "Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or employees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording. Additionally, in the absence of a Confirmation executed by both parties, any such recording may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to the terms of a Transaction."   Marty:  This would appear in Part 5(f) of the Schedule.  Let me know if this is acceptable.  I'll follow up with Tanya on Monday. 
 Attached is an updating memorandum addressing the impact of Argentine tax issues on our trading business in Argentina. 
 Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to you at once.  I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.  You will see our "No Reliance" and "Limitation of Liability" provisions included. None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).  Unfortunately, I  do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written guidelines or policy addressing the provision of  quotes to customers.  I will follow up when I have the response.  Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference. Regards.  Sara 
 As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC ("ESA") confirmation issue is draining our little brains.  Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled. Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.). Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.  Brent:  please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.  Sara 
 Mike:  I have not heard from since my prior message attached below.  Have you had a chance to consider our request? I look forward to hearing from you. Please email or call me at (713) 664-3207.  Regards.  Sara 
 It was slight address change to:  sshackl@enron.com  (the address only deleted the "ect" piece) 
 Brent:  We'll call you at 2 pm Houston time.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be unable to make the meeting tomorrow.  I have no changes to my list from last week.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I spoke with Chris Littlefield (legal) a few moments ago and he would like for you to call Dial's treasury person, Dave Riddiford.  Dial really wants an explanation of how/why all numbers were selected for inclusion in the Schedule and CSA, including:  (1)  3rd p. D/F Threshold Amount (2) whether Credit Event Upon Merger can be tied to ratings downgrade (I explained the MAC trigger) (3) Collateral Threshold  (and, by the way, Chris says that he never understood that Dial would ever have to post) (4) Min. Transfer/Rounding  Not too bad.  Call me if you have any questions.  From the legal perspective, I have only to resolve recording and arbitration.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The latest swap schedule and confirm are in the documents attached.  Sara 
 Per our conversation, I'll be happy to assist Lucy during your absence.  Sara 
 Attached are comments to the Schedule but not the CSA. Russell:  Have you had any conversations with FP&L credit? 
 Attached is my recollection of items to be decided once Marie leaves the group. 
 See attached.  Bob:  please call me.  SS 
 Susan:  Please change the signature block as set forth below and I'll review.  Also, we'll email to CP.  SS 
 Brenda:  This looks fine.  Please have an executed copy sent to the attention of Susan Flynn (for ENA's files).  Sara 
 Susan:  The two above-mentioned projects are in the process of being unwound.  The only confirm and the Master Swap Agreement for each are being TERMINATED.  Will you please continue to follow up with Brenda Funk (in the capital mgmt. group with Scott Sefton and Gareth Bahlman) to get copies of the "Swap Termination Agreement" for each and then enter the info into Lotus Notes.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Who is working on the "Jana Morse agency" agreement?  SS 
 Deborah:  I understand that an EES asset is going into an asset trust for Hawaii 125-0 and that ENE wants a back-to-back swap with EES.  Is EES the swap counterparty?  Sara 
 Attached AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY is a "Transition Memo" which Marie prepared to capture her current workload.  Could you please utilize that format and prepare a summary of your current workload?  Mark, Carol and I would like to receive your lists as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday evening. Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail, attached is the short letter I originally approved to explain the situation.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Derek:  I just wanted to let you know that I will be available to help you on swap matters now that Shari has transitioned to another group.  You can always reach me at Ext. 35620.  Please let me hear from you.  Sara 
 Paul:  Did you learn anything further about the credit protection referencing Deutsche Telecom bonds? Also, Shari does not know anything about a JV with Deutsche Telecom.  Did I misunderstand you? Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is revised summary.  Also, I have asked Susan B. and Susan F. to prepare a list similar to Marie's list for delivery by the end of the day Thursday.  Sara 
 I'd love to have 2 tickets.  Sara   JANETTE ELBERTSON 03/29/2000 11:25 AM 
 Sorry for the delay.  My address is:  3915 Coleridge Houston, TX  77005  You can add "and Guest" to the invitation. Hope all is well.  Regards.  Sara

 David,  I am sending you the latest Pulp & Paper disclaimer per Sara Shackleton's request.   Kaye 
 I will need to leave the office at approximately 5 pm.  Sara 
 Close.  Credit is considering credit terms for the deal.  If executed today, we'll have to do a Deemed ISDA and simultaneously send out a draft ISDA for negotiation.  Do you have a deal ticket already?  I understand it's a 7-year deal.  SS 
 Thanks for your help!  I'll let you know what I learn.  SS 
 Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment. 
 Please print for David.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the language which should replace (i) in the Additional Provisions.  Also, in your part (ii) [now part (iii)], the words "Fixed Price" should be capitalized each time used.  Also, you should add the following sentence to numbered paragraph "1" on the first page:  "Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to said terms in the Agreement." 
 Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized). Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. Also, let's have lunch.  Sara 
 Attached is the revised letter agreement between EES and Enron Corp. 
 Is there a call in the morning?  Everyone will be in Houston.  Sara 
 (1)  The term "Threshold Amount" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., "Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets the threshold level and we input that number into the document.  (2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her number is X34737.  SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 You'll handle? 
 Sorry I can't help. Also, you know that legal will be out of the office from Wed. afternoon through the end of the week.  Are there any pressing items?  Sara 
 Am reviewing now.  SS 
 Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:  (1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]  (2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ through 4/29/11]  (3)  Currency Swap between "ECT" and "Sutton Bridge" booked 3/29/00 [ through 3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.  I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara (X35620) 
 Jarrod:  that language works fine.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 (1)  Commonwealth Bank (in Australia) (2)  EPM ECHO Ltd.  Also, I need to have your respose to Statoil which I left on your voice mail. And, further, are you looking into Deutsche Bank?  I'll be checking voice mail while I'm in San Antonio.  I gave the credit group in Houston Thursday and Friday off.  Sara 
 I'm working on it.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail.  I have not heard a word.  SS 
 I didn't see any codes on your website.  I am interested in pricing the following:  Vulcano by Magistretti Konx by Arad Eco and Eco Due by von Kline Manta by Semprini (small size) Flexuoso by Vigna  Thank you.  Sara Shackleton 
 "Following Business Day Convention" means the convention for adjusting any relevant date if it falls on a day that is not a Business Day (when commercial banks settle payments is USD in N.Y., for our purposes) to the first following day that is a Business Day or a trading day for the relevant floating price source.  I hope I have given you a simple description.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Susan:  I didn't see this on the master list.  Can you locate the request? Sara 
 Susan:  Could you please create a blackline and fax to Cargill.  Marie already made most of the changes.  Thanks.  Sara ps - file is on your chair 
 Flowers and lunch sounds good.  SS 
 I know they approved the opinion but it is redundant.  I'll show you what I think should be changed.  SS 
 Are you going to respond to David? Has this Master been executed?  Sara 
 Brent:  Andrea Calo has not joined our phone conference.  Randy want to know if you have a deal sheet for him.  Sara 
 David:  Hope you got back home alright!  I'll follow up if Shari is unable. Also, did you tell me that you had a copy of some type of Australian financial policy memo and/or trading guidelines for the Australian market? 
 David:  Please give me another day to review your email.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Just a heads up!  ENA has finalized our Master Swap Agreement with Statoil. You may recall that Statoil would now like to execute an agreement with ECTRIC using the ENA agreement as a model.  I have been dealing with the Statoil inhouse lawyer whose name is Chuck O'Brien.  Regards.  Sara 
 Attached are copies of the drafts sent to ABN AMRO Incorporated in January, 2000.   I have been out of town and apologize for the delay.  Sara 
 Sorry, I filled out the form and sent it to HR.  It was difficult to rank the candidate using the printed form but I thought she looked very good and after speaking with Elizabeth to get her impressions (which I have not done), I would probably make her an offer.  Sara 
 please respond 
 Marie:  Sutton Bridge was sold.  That is all I know.  Following is the situation regarding outstanding swaps.  We need to keep a record somewhere. Sara 
 Marlene,  I am Sara Shackleton's assistant.  The contact information you have for Sara is partially correct.  The email address you have is correct but she has an additional address if it is easier to remember.  It is Sara.Shackleton@enron.com.  The following are the correct mailing addresses:  Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX 77002-7361  Dir:   713-853-5620 Fax:  713-646-3490  P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188  If you need any additional information, my email address is Kaye.Ellis@enron.com  Regards,  Kaye 
 Sure.  Also, this confirm needs to be tracked b/c counterparty needs to fulfill a condition for ECT.  SS 
 As you may know, Project Ghost was unwound eff. 3/31/00.  I believe that Project MacArthur was also unwound. (but I haven't seen anything).  Also, Project Blackbird is in the process of being unwound.  Each will have a Swap Termination Agreement.  Brenda Funk should be organizing closing docs. Please make necessary entries on Lotus Notes and keep supporting documentation in the files.  I don't see Projects Ghost, Spector or Hawaii on Lotus Notes (these show up on your status of files list to Mark.  Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Chris:  I left voice mails for both Tracy Ngo and Tanya Rohauer about Delano.  I've had no response.  SS 
 Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review Kris's fax   If you have your own form, please send and we can review.  Sara 
 Julia:  To close the loop, it appears that none of the swaps were terminated.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Please per my voice mail, let's sit down in my office and catch up because there are a lot of loose ends on the brokerage side (particularly with Marie leaving).  I can address you emails (current and past) at that time.  Thanks.  Sara 
 David:  Attached is an example of the "tainted swaption".  I'd really like to focus on the dates (Trade, Effective, Exercise).  Looking forward to call in the morning.  Sara 
 We are very short on legal help at the moment.  Please permit me to respond to your request early next week with an acceptable time.  Thank you.  Sara 
 Has this ever been finalized? 
 Taffy told me that Susan's husband had court this morning so she is late.  Is this weird or am I weird?  Sara 
 I am still waiting to hear whether ENA will transact with [Soc Gen] today (or whether Enron Australia will document its first weather trade).  SS 
 Attached is a suggested form of opinion.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 That will be fine.  SS 
 ENA has a multibranch ISDA master with Soc Gen.  SS 
 After "Written Confirmation of Notice of Exercise", add the following:  "Seller's facsimile number for purposes of giving notice:"                      [we need a person and fax number because the master refers only to 'President" and 440-449-9868]    Jarrod:  is the counterparty asking for a special type of delivery (I wouldn't think so) 
 FYI only 
 Do you have a phone number?  thanks 
 Susan:  In Marie's absence, could you please send Paul Simons a copy of the Statoil master?   Thanks.  SS 
 Yes, I need the chart to reflect EACH MONTH during the term of the transaction.  Sara 
 left you a voice mail.   Have we ever done a basis swap with Phibro or the UK entitiy?  What is the payment date?  This deal concluded about a month ago. SS 
 Attached is a new credit worksheet for Capex.  SS 
 Kaye:  Don't worry about credit.  Please focus on confirms/settlements.  Tana will handle global contracts.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye will update the confirm/settlement list and send out the email.  Do you want her to handle global contracts or will you?  Sara 
 Marie:  I would like to schedule a meeting with you and others to review the agreement process, your contacts, account information, record retention (physical files and Lotus Notes), reporting procedures, any forms which you have developed and helpful tips.  I know that you are working on a memo which will address this information and it would be extremely helpful if we could learn from your experience. I would also like to discuss Ted Murphy's expectations.  I think this will take about an hour.  Please give me a suggested time during the week.  Thanks.  Sara

 nothing attached 
 FYI only.  It looks like this trade will be done by EAF. 
 I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.  The initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.  On a slightly different note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review work in progress, issues, products, etc.?  If so, who should be included? Thanks.  Sara 
 Had a conversation with PG&E this afternoon and we're almost finished.  Just a few loose ends to tie up.  Sara 
 After our meeting, I also agreed to provide suggested language for hedge funds.  It is attached. 
 Transfer.  Section 7 is hereby amended by adding the following Subsection (c): "(c)  Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate so long as the obligations of such Affiliate are guaranteed by Enron Corp. pursuant to a guaranty substantially similar to the one provided on behalf of Party A, provided that such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default."  Rod and I will follow up on the Letter of Credit issues.  Have a nice weekend.  Regards.  Sara

My goal is for  the paper and pulp group to adopt the recommendations.  Please take a look at the memo and give me your comments.  I would like to respond to Cadwalader by the middle of next week. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Has Taffy finalized the confirm "hotline" solution?  The paralegals have no plan other than to rely on the confirm desk to call a live person.

 Please hold these names until we can agree on a date for this luncheon. Thanks.  SS 
 Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS

 Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.

I am currently into Danish modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems (which we had been trying to locate).
