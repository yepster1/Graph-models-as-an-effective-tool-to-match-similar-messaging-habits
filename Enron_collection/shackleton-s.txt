 Won't you carve your deal out of the Threshold for your "Deemed ISDA"? 
 I'll be out of the office on Sept. 27 and 28. 
 Susan:  While Tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a "blank form Paragraph 13" for this master.  Just our standard.  Caveat:  subject to credit review even though there are blanks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  In case Global Finance is desparate in the next two days, I'm forwarding the project in this email and a following email.  Thanks.  Sara 
 2nd email.  Sara 
 Clint:  I spoke with Mike Collins [203-719-8385 (phone) and 203-719-7031 (fax)] who conrfirmed to me that the cap included the remaining 2.5+million remaining shares.  Please return an executed copy of confirm to me.  Thanks.  sara  My assistant Joanne Rozycki has cell, car numbers to reach me.  I'll be back on Monday.

 Thanks.  SS 
 Marie:  Can you please refresh my memory? Sara 
 Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - this impacts EOL trades; didn't know if you were aware of these issues. 
 I can wait; just didn't want it to slip through the cracks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here it is.  I'm fairly certain that Annabel said the assignment was fine and we'd execute when we got the Securities Lending Agreement done.  SS 
 FYI only 
 All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES. The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues. Who is currently responsible for this counterparty? Please respond.  Thanks for your help.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Sheila:  Please send your usual message on this one.  I assume it is for ECT Investments Inc. Thanks.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Please send your usual message on this one as well.  There are several written agreements involved.  Thanks.  Sara

 Sam, Marie and Stephanie:  Would you please finalize all Brokerage Agreements with entries identified as "Sent for execution"?   A fully executed agreement should reside in the red file.  Please have this completed prior to October 15.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Mark:  Can you please reply to (1) below? Also, any ideas for help with brokerage agreements? Thanks.  Sara 
 Clint:  Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.  It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.  Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.  Please verify with deal tickets.  I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.  Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).  I have Jim's comment for "material information".  Thanks.

 Marie:  Does this sound weird opening the account on Sept. 27?  I thought this was done some time ago. SS 
 Mark:  I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.  I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.  Thanks.

 Carol:  Susan and I are available anytime.  How about 9 am (since our trading meeting is at 11 am)?  Sara 
 Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.  There is some type of meeting this afternoon.  It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.  FYI - I was in  the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.  Sara 
 You need to send an email to Donna Lowry, Cassandra Schultz, William S. Bradford  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Tracy:  Please let us know when you have reached a conclusion.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.  Fred should try to negotiate this one.  I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m.  Kim is aware of this situation.

 Ed:  I received a message from the lawyer for Cinergy Energy Services requesting that the ENA ISDA be with CG&E.  This will solve our allocation issues (as the utility will hedge for its own account).  Please send a new credit worksheet.  Thanks.

 I need the city's bond counsel (outside counsel). 
 Stephanie:  Can you please ask Francisco or Anne to handle?  Thanks. 
 Rich:  I'm waiting to hear from credit.  Sara 
  FYI 
 fyi 
 We are going to do this at our own expense.  But we would like to hire Glendale's bond counsel.  I don't know the name of Glendale's bond counsel or how to get in touch with them. 
 Susan: I can't remember whether I asked you to send the proposed Par. 13 to Tanya (or maybe I asked my assistant).  Please remind me.  Thanks. 
 Tanya:  I think we sent the ENA ISDA to you but I'm going to refax since First Union is calling daily.  We sent them a "blank" Paragraph 13 and they are asking for credit terms.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Gil:  (1)  the BS&Co. confirm references the "Irrevocable Sell Order dated August 9, 2001".  Please forward a copy.  This apparently contains definitions for (multiple) Sell Order Execution Dates.  (2)  according to your notes, the BSIL "Standard Terms and Conditions of Business" is subject to review by a UK lawyer.  Please advise of your conclusions. Forward executed version (which is incorporated into the confirms).  (3)  the BS&Co. confirm references the Customer Agreement and incorporates this as a Credit Support Document.   Please forward executed verison.  [BS&Co. also claims that deals pursuant to your Customer Agreement are Specified Transactions for purposes of OTC derivative transactions]  (4)  portions of the confirm do not match the unexecuted Term Sheet which you gave me.  Was a Term Sheet executed?  Is there an ENE guaranty which is supposed to be a Credit Support Document under the confirm?

 Kim:  Sounds like you're confused.  ENA is requiring two opinions:  one from Glendale (inhouse) and another which we are paying for (Glendale's outside counsel)  Call me.  Please do not forward my messages to Glendale because we are now at cross purposes.  There is no need to alarm Glendale about our existing arrangements.  Sara 
 Gil:  Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

 Mark:  You never assigned this one.  Attached is the EOL list.  Chase merged with JP Morgan and we need to upgrade/select existing master. 
 Please forward your email requests to the RAC group for opening this account.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.  Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Tom:  There is no existing Enron company named "ECT Europe Investments Inc.".  We need the legal name of the company.  Also, does that company have existing resolutions for opening brokerage accounts? 
 Maria and Michael:  The form of confirmation of fine.  How would you like to handle execution of this transaction?  of remaining transactions?  Scheduling the VE discussion for later this week is also acceptable.  We look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.

 Can you please submit a new credit worksheet?  Thanks. 
 Maggie:  I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  (1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?  (2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)  (3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.  (4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?  (5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?  (6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:  "Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."  This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?  (6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."  (7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?  (8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained? 
 Per my voice mail 
 David:  Actually, Jeff and I have eliminated the "agency" issue.  Jeff proposed that ENA transact directly with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (the A rated utility).  Sara

 Ed:  Do you want legal to do anything at this point? Sara 
 Stewart:  Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.  Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.  Give me a call if you have a chance.  Thanks.

 Kim:  Is the legal entity for PacificCorp:	PacificCorp Power Marketing, Inc.?  Is there only an entity for financial power?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kathryn:  The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:  Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master) Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master) Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master) Ameren Energy (none) American Electric Service Power Corporation (none) PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)  The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.  Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Kim:  Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

 Tammy:  Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:  (1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.  (2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?  Please let me hear form you.

 Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only. 
 Russ:  The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.  Thanks.

 Sheila:  Just a few notes from the Agreement:  (1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin (2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA) (3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time" (4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please? (5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days? (6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation (7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades  Thanks.

 Jane: Jane:  I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.  I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts: (1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date (2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed (3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage). (4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format.  Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.  Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.  Regards.

 Tammy:  Thanks for the quick response.  Your "business day" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara 
 Darren: I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

 Rob:  Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.  I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.  FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.  I left a voice mail.  Let me know how you want to proceed.  Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.  Thanks.  Sara    Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.  We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.  Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:  (1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal  (2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.  (3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)  (4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's  (5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.  (6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral  (7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB  (8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC  Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Rebecca:  Per our conversation, attached please find Clorox's blackline.  You should have Aparna's file including the credit worksheet.  Also, Aparna should have provided you wtih a copy of the ISDA boilerplate (let me know if you need this or anything else).  The credit issues we should focus on include:  (1)  request for cross acceleration [Part 1(b) page 1] (2)  Cross Default amendment for operational issues [Part 1(b) page 1] (3)  Credit Event Upon Merger:  use of "materially weaker" definition [Part 1(c) pages 1-2] (4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3] (5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments] (6)  elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8] (7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9] (8)  Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1] (9)  complete change to Threshold and Independent Amount [Annex A pages 2-3] (10) "Minimum Transfer Amount" from $0 to $500,000 (11) elimination of the MAC in Par. 13 to the Credit Support Annex [Annex A page 8] (12)  Enron Corp. guaranty:  elimination of cap [see Enron Corp. guaranty]  I look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday.

 How about Thursday at 10 am?  Sara 
 Kim:  A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these. 
 Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.  (1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?  (2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.  Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins. To date, we have only focused on:  ENA EPMI ENE ENA Upstream Company LLC `	EPMI  We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).  Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions).  Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 Kim:  I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:  (1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations  (2)  Don't capitalize the word "party" in either version  (3)  Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version  (4)  Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version  When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.  Thanks.  Sara

 Rex, Jim and Clint:  You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001.  In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).  Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

 Kim Theriot can probably locate these confirms 
 Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

 Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?  (3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?

("Bear") in accounts for the following companies:  Enron North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]  ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]  Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]  I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.  ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.  We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 There is a Weil Gotshal lawyer in your office named Andrew Harting. (currently in a first floor conference room - 30101).  He and I just spoke about the Bear situation.  He will also assist with the Enron Credit Limited efforts to move ENA and ECI positions to London.  Please contact him and bring him up to date.  Then let's talk.

 These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.  Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?  Sara 
 Sam:  Please see me in the a.m.  We are going to use this party as a test case for valuation and will need to organize a binder now.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Just spoke with Cindy Ma who tells me that Wilbur Foster will be in Houston next Thurs/Fri.  She again says that Millbank is asking about our strategy for handling in the money gas swaps.  I know you guys are managing the EY relationship and I just wanted to let you know how she's bouncing.

 How about 9:30 on the 30th floor?  Sara 
 Will you please call Ty (whatever her name is)?  The reason being that their termination notice relates to the ISDA (I believe) which we do not have.  Thanks. 
 Nancy: I have forwarded this to Cynthia as part of the "intercompany contracts" review process.  Sara 
 I asked him if he knew of any hedge funds in TX or CA. 
 per our meeting 
 Call me.  Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment. 
 Here's an electronic verison of Tanya's 11/30/01 credit ag report 
 Ellen:  Did ENA close all positions?  How much margin was posted and has it been returned to an ENA account?  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 Alex:  The documents look fine.  I am having the waiver reviewed by our bankruptcy attorney and I have not yet received a response.  The signature blocks will change.  The U.S. Enron Entities will require a V.P. signature.  The U.K. entity has two directors. I'll touch base with you in the morning.  Thanks for your help.

 A few questions:  (1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?  (2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 No way.

 Cheryl:  Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?  Thanks.

 thanks 
 Ed:  I think this answers the question.  I know to research outstanding broker claims (e.g.,  BNP Paribas is witholding USD 80,000,000 to setoff against other claims).

 Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.  The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

 I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.  Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

 Sure; I think we can do that now.  I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.  However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.  Sara

 Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:  I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.  With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.  Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.  Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?  I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Alan:  We need Ed Smida's help with prioritizing the EGM in-the-money requests from Beth Apollo's group.  Beth is only focused on physical gas and power appearing on Don Miller's list.  Ed S. can really help me and PWC in bringing a small but discrete number of EGM parties to the top of the list.  Sara

 Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:  Goldman Sachs & Co.  Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.  I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.  We can discuss further at 2:30.

 Weezie:  Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have reviewed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.  Such counterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial product and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple reviews.

 Financial trading is just now gearing up to send these follow-up letters.  The few that have been sent have been incorporated into the counterparty files and logged onto the "Master Letter Log" which is updated by Stephanie Panus.  Sara 
 Becky:  can you please make an addition:  After the the termination value brackets, put a period and add:  "A valuation sheet is attahced."  Thanks.  Sara 
 Weezie: =20 =20 Thanks for the info.  There are some items that need to be corrected.  Let'= s discuss when you have a minute.  Sara 
 Mark:  I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.  Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490 
 I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara 
 Ed:   The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:  Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.  The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.  Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.  Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.  Sara 
 That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

 We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.  This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.  I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.  (1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate? (2)  Is this a single swap or several? (3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

 Louis:  Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.

 Scottie:  I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.  I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.  Sara

 You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.  What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.  Sara

 ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.  Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.  (1)  Louis/Mike:  (i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha. (ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.  (2)  Samantha:  When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.  (3)  Angelo:  If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.  Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.  Just copy me in case I receive a call.

 Brent:  I must have been reviewing something from this CP when I sent the message to Tanya.  Is Tanya right about having discussed this with you already?  I can't remember.  Sara 
 Ed:  Looks like Haedicke and Derrick are the sole directors and signers for this deal.  Both are in the office today. Can you please prepare a short memo summarizing deal and request for signatures for me to present to them?  I am not familiar with either the insurance contract or the credit derivatives. Thanks.

 Termination letter setting Termination Date as 1/25/02. Terminates the ISDA Master Agreement and deal nos. Y23821.1 and Y20976.1. ENA owes $604,957.62 and "calculations" are attached.

 I'll check out the Big B.R. forecast before I come in. 
 Lisa:  ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.  Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

 Bob and Tanya:  ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.  The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."  We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin?  Please call to discuss.

 yes, earlier this year (posted in the form of "up front collateral").

 Per my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).  This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.  Thanks, as usual.  Sara 
 Jonathan:  The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:  page 2	-	2.2 page 4	-	4.2 page 5	-	7.3 page 10	-	12.5 page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III) Page 18-	7.9  Also, I'm uncertain of the following:  page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright? page 17-	7.3	Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)? page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard? Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?  Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.  Sara 
 Sheila:  A few points:  (1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.  (2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.  (3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)  (4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?  (5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.  (6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?  (7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.  Thanks.

 I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.  ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.  Hope this helps.

 Jay and Tanya:  Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.  (1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]  (2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.  (3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.  (4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.  (5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.  On a different note,  (5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.  (6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.  (7)  The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc." and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.  QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?  Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

 Jim:  Please see attached.  Urgent.  Sara 
 thank you, thank you, thank you

 All:  Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.  ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate.  Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

 Gil:  Will you be handling the documentation?  Does JSB Asset, LLC have an authorized trader list? a resolution to open the account? 
 fyi - I don't have any idea if this will be routed in accordance with the "process" for ENA brokerage agreements  Do you care?  This is the second such brokerage agreement coming from Gil.  Sara 
 ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.  ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.  I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.  Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.

 Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

 Kim:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.  I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jorge:  The Confirmation which you faxed to me references the attached Exhibit A which is the original confirmation for Transaction 1980816.  Please send it to me.  Thanks.

 Jorge:  Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.  It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".  The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.  You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.  Please let me know if you have further questions.

 Tom:  I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.  Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty?  Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?  Please advise me and credit of the status.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rudwell:  You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.  Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?  Thanks.

 FYI 
 How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:  "The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."  The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.  Let me know what you think. Sara 
 Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].  Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.  Sara 
 Ellen:  Feel free to send the language.  I'm not sure Peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified.  And yes, I think it would be helpful if everyone discussed the changes and methodology ahead of time.  Sara

 All:  I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.  In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.  How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

 Hi, Mark:  ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:  "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."  Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?  I'd appreciate your insight.  Regards, Sara  Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street, EB3801a Houston, TX  77002 Ph:  (713) 853-5620 Fax: (713) 646-3490

 David:  Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.  The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.  NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.  I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.  Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.  Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

I need the attachment which I have identified as merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).

 It's not at the top of my list.   Sorry. We'll have to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation.  SS 
 Mike:  An ISDA Master Agreement is currently in the works for Deseret.  Marie Heard is the paralegal and I'll probably take a look at the document.  Please bear with us as we have lost one of our attorneys and are swamped.  Thanks. Sara 
 I'm  busy today and tomorrow.  But I'll book up to 60 days in advance (like the French Laundry in Napa) for you.  SS 
 Brent:  sorry for my poor "attaching abilities."  Hopefully we will have a lot to discuss tomorrow.  Lynn has a suggested the use of a separate "action list" to present to Mike.  SS 
 The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.  The convention in the physical world (as I understand it) is that the seller sends its paper.  SS 
 By letter dated 3/9/00, Tembec Inc. has requested the transfer of "Contract No. EJ7774.1" dated 3/23/98 to the National Bank of Canada pursuant to Section 7 of the ISDA Master, to be effective April 1, 2000, but with Q1 payment to be made to Tembec.  We do have a master with the National Bank of Canada.  Please let us know if this transfer is approved.  SS 
 I received comments from Vintage (remember, no CSA).  With respect to Transfer, Vintage wants ENA to provide a guaranty of a transferee Affiliate's performance under the master.  Let me know your response, please.  Sara 
 Yes, offshore (ie, as ENA) with an onshore or offshore counterparty, as it desires.  SS 
 Whomever  would like to add to their list can see me.  Thanks.  SS 
 Here's the doc I want to save - 
 I've scheduled a meeting with Guy on March 30 
 I think you're the wonder woman of swapland.  Congrats.  SS 
 I know that we try to limit the provisions but we should consider:  1.  confidentiality (in the miscellaneous section, perhaps) 2.  setoff where there is no early termination date (is this covered by NY/TX state setoff laws?)  I'll try to meet with Carol and Shari next week to develop a list of issues/recommendations for you.  We may come up with more omnibus items.  SS 
 I think this should work for the group (including Mark and Shari) 
 What should I do with this?  SS 
 Please contact my assistant, Kaye Ellis @ 3-5968 about these changes.  Sara 
 I'll need help finalizing this (Flynn) Master.  Just let me know who can help on Monday.  Sara 
 major changes to Fixed Price and Additional Provisions 
 I read your language and I think its too vague.  You don't want to include existing risk management services. 
 For Monday 
 Did you ever receive any paperwork from this fund on behalf of Zachary?  How was NY?  Mother sure is talkative these days.  Hope all is well  Sass 
 Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).  Also, I am not planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize our financial trading matrix.  I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly. 
 Could I please have a copy of the final?  SS 
 On March 9, Susan Flynn sent to Ing. Guillaume Rivron a memo regarding Process Agent (specifically, CT Corp.) and a form of certificate for Delivery of Documents.  This was copied to Martin Cassone and Julian Poole, both via fax.  Susan is out of the office most of this week.  SS 
 Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 1999.  Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara 
 We have been asked to assist in the setting up of an account with Morgan for the sale of this stock (through John Greene) held in the name of "Enron Communications Investments Corp.".  Restrictions (technically expired on 3/12/00) on the shares are in the process of being lifted by the transfer agent.  Let me know if you need further information. We are working with Mike Deville and Gill Melman (ECI legal).  Thanks.  Sara 
 forwarding instructions 
 Same question I just asked you.  SS ps  let me know if you can schedule Donna (excluding 2-3 pm) 
 Attached is Sara Shackleton's Report.    Kaye 
 I must be on a separate list because I do receive these clippings from A. Bueno.  Thanks.  SS 
 FYI - Southwestern Bell is installing equipment in my home on April 3.  They will call me 1 hour before arrival.  This is just a head's up that I may have to dash out sometime during the day.  SS 
 Attached is a sample "format" for summarizing swap group activity.  Please add your own activities and feel free to edit the sample.  Suggestions are welcome.  I'll edit responses in time  for our meeting next week.  Thanks. Sara 
 Of course it works!  Had lunch just now with Carson Llewellyn.  He's in private practice in Houston and said things had slowed down a bit here.  Have a great weekend.  SS    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Please review and call me. 
 Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the following two items:  (1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not sure which it is) that "financial institutions" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)  (2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?  Give my regards to Pablo.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara 
 attached is redrafted language which can "stand alone" or we can also incorporate the chart. (Jared, I think you have some prior language we can use, and we may have to rename one or two parts of the chart).  SS 
 OK, I have reviewed Lawhill  and AIG Funds.  Marie is making changes and the goal is to get blacklines of AIG to Rod today (since AIG has credit issues only).  The issues revolve around the Collateral Threshold and Letters fo Credit.  Lawhill will be ready for execution.  SS 
 Have you run your change past this guy or Morley? 
 Thanks for your message.  We are in the process of turning a blackline.  Sara 
 Please open new file "Project Spector"  (or Spectre?) and print the docs below.  Gareth Bahlman's assistant should know the name.  Thanks.  Sara 
 per our discussion 
 I thought there were 5 funds.  SS 
 Looks like nothing was ever done on this so I've contacted Tracy Ngo to move on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.  Do I need to call Holli?  Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on this?  Sara    Christian Yoder 
 I want to join.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Attached is a clean version which incorporates most of Brent's comments. Please read again.  Sara 
 Yeah.  Also, Clem wants to join us for sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Be careful.  Sara 
 We have been asked to set this entity up for financial trading.  It's part of our JV with Texaco.  Hal Bertram (X31865) is a good contact person if you have questions about the Bridgeline companies.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Here's the only info that I have on this counterparty.  Sara 
 please print 
 Credit is reviewing file and we are trying to determine whether this entity is "eligible" (for swap transactions).  I should know more soon.  Sara 
 Yao went back to Africa!  I think he'll return next week.  SS

 PLEASE DISREGARD THE DRAFT MEMO SENT ON 3/16/00.  I have reworked a new memo which prints on 3 pages and which I hope is brief and to the point.  Let's try to talk before Friday so that we can send the memo before then.  I still have not heard from Patricia Lopez.  SS 
 I have to leave the office at 10:30 to be at my home.  I should be back after lunch.  If you need to reach me, please feel free to call at (713) 664-3207. Thanks.  Sara 
 print redline for each and the following 
 I gave the Kevin the OK and he was going to prepare a waiver letter.  Our conversation was some time ago.  Sara 
 Can you please forward my report from last week and update the "week".  Also, change target date of Argentina report to this Friday.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I'll need you to standby for coordination (only) on: Ghost unwind Specter Hawaii 
 Statoil - use of multiproduct guaranty similar to one executed by parent/ENE Spinnaker - sent draft to you BP - I'll see what we have to do Basin - name of contact.  No such person as Bob Hall 
 Thanks! 
 I am interested in flying.  Sara 
 This is the "format" for the exhibit to change payment accounts from the CP to the bank 
 Please review assignment language Par 12 (C),(G) for accuracy. 
 Attached is the list that Marie had prepared for me just last week (the date at the top is incorrect) which is a good start.  We will still need a detailed description of the brokerage agreement process.  Sara 
 Attached is revised language to drop in the confirm.  John:  Please approve. Joe:  edit my margins AND does the preamble of the confirm use the word "Agreement" to define the Master Agreement?  THIS IS NOT AN ISDA! 
 Attached is the ESP definition taken from the commodities regulations. 
 I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is perhaps interested in ENA. 
 Just an example of "brokerage account stuff" that can occur with respect to a single account.  SS 
 I have three Canadian utilities almost ready to go; checking Canadian legal issues.  Sara 
 you are too good    Enron North America Corp. 
 John is the ONLY authorized trader for the Morgan account.  SS 
 OK - forget the prior list I sent!  It really WAS from 1998.  Attached is a real live current version which can be expanded.  Sara 
 Please follow up.  Also, we need to follow up with Chuck Gilbert (counsel for CP) for docs.  Thanks.  Sara 
 yes, I can attend    Enron North America Corp. 
 Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second "Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar with this transaction.  Sara 
 Pablo:  I am forwarding this message that I send to Patricia last week.  She may be out of town or otherwise engaged.  Would it be possible for you (or someone else in the firm) to respond to my two questions?  I only need a short explanation.  If you need to reach me, my telephone is (713) 853-5620 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.  Thank you for your assistance.  Regards.  Sara 
 I received a message without further identification and I'm momentarily baffled.  Maybe the name rings a bell.  Thanks.  Sara 
 That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).  Regards. Sara 
 I'll send you a FedEX tonight with my seminar enclosures.  Thanks.  Sara 
 It was and my apologies.  Sara 
 We now need to appoint David Vitrella as an authorized trader for the ECIC account (per Ted's OK below).  Sara 
 The following transactions are happening this week and quarter end (as to Project Hawaii 125-0): Project Ghost unwind Project Spector (remaining Rhythms stock put into identical Ghost structure) Project Hawaii 125-0 (permanent structure to handle FASB -125 deals)  Rod:  I believe you looked at Ghost last year.  Let me know if you have any Spector issues. Bill and Rod:  I will send you summary terms for Project Hawaii 125-0. 
 Attached are summary documents.  I am in the process of reviewing the swap piece now.  Sara 
 HELP! 
 Patricia,  Sara is unable to open your attachment.  Could you please fax the information to her.  The fax number is 713-646-3490.  Thank you,  Kaye 
 let me know if this prints ok 
 I left a message yesterday for Chris Littlefield to schedule call.  I have not heard back.  SS 
 Don't worry 
 Per our discussion, please see attached.  Sara 
 Hi, Serge.  I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.  Paul Karns mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.  You can reach me via email or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.  I will be negotiating the agreement on behalf of ENA. 
 Please see attached.  SS 
 Per my voice mail, please add the following sentence after the two signature blocks:  The undersigned hereby guarantees the timely payment when due of the obligations of Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC under this Transaction and this Confirmation in an amount not to exceed U.S. $5,000,000.  BRIDGELINE GAS MARKETING LLC By:  Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. By:  Bridgeline LLC  P.S to Bob:  I am not certain of the signature line as I have not heard back from Barbara. 
 We have to respond to comments on the Credit Support Annex and a few items in the Schedule..  We are waiting for copies of standing  PUC orders from PG&E (addressing derivatives issues) as well as a blackline of the Schedule since PG&E controls the drafting.  Sara 
 "Each party consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other party of any and all communications between officers or employees of the parties, and waives any further notice of such recording. Additionally, in the absence of a Confirmation executed by both parties, any such recording may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to the terms of a Transaction."   Marty:  This would appear in Part 5(f) of the Schedule.  Let me know if this is acceptable.  I'll follow up with Tanya on Monday. 
 Attached is an updating memorandum addressing the impact of Argentine tax issues on our trading business in Argentina. 
 Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to you at once.  I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.  You will see our "No Reliance" and "Limitation of Liability" provisions included. None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).  Unfortunately, I  do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written guidelines or policy addressing the provision of  quotes to customers.  I will follow up when I have the response.  Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference. Regards.  Sara 
 As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC ("ESA") confirmation issue is draining our little brains.  Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled. Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.). Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.  Brent:  please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.  Sara 
 Mike:  I have not heard from since my prior message attached below.  Have you had a chance to consider our request? I look forward to hearing from you. Please email or call me at (713) 664-3207.  Regards.  Sara 
 It was slight address change to:  sshackl@enron.com  (the address only deleted the "ect" piece) 
 Brent:  We'll call you at 2 pm Houston time.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be unable to make the meeting tomorrow.  I have no changes to my list from last week.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I spoke with Chris Littlefield (legal) a few moments ago and he would like for you to call Dial's treasury person, Dave Riddiford.  Dial really wants an explanation of how/why all numbers were selected for inclusion in the Schedule and CSA, including:  (1)  3rd p. D/F Threshold Amount (2) whether Credit Event Upon Merger can be tied to ratings downgrade (I explained the MAC trigger) (3) Collateral Threshold  (and, by the way, Chris says that he never understood that Dial would ever have to post) (4) Min. Transfer/Rounding  Not too bad.  Call me if you have any questions.  From the legal perspective, I have only to resolve recording and arbitration.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The latest swap schedule and confirm are in the documents attached.  Sara 
 Per our conversation, I'll be happy to assist Lucy during your absence.  Sara 
 Attached are comments to the Schedule but not the CSA. Russell:  Have you had any conversations with FP&L credit? 
 Attached is my recollection of items to be decided once Marie leaves the group. 
 See attached.  Bob:  please call me.  SS 
 Susan:  Please change the signature block as set forth below and I'll review.  Also, we'll email to CP.  SS 
 Brenda:  This looks fine.  Please have an executed copy sent to the attention of Susan Flynn (for ENA's files).  Sara 
 Susan:  The two above-mentioned projects are in the process of being unwound.  The only confirm and the Master Swap Agreement for each are being TERMINATED.  Will you please continue to follow up with Brenda Funk (in the capital mgmt. group with Scott Sefton and Gareth Bahlman) to get copies of the "Swap Termination Agreement" for each and then enter the info into Lotus Notes.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Who is working on the "Jana Morse agency" agreement?  SS 
 Deborah:  I understand that an EES asset is going into an asset trust for Hawaii 125-0 and that ENE wants a back-to-back swap with EES.  Is EES the swap counterparty?  Sara 
 Attached AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY is a "Transition Memo" which Marie prepared to capture her current workload.  Could you please utilize that format and prepare a summary of your current workload?  Mark, Carol and I would like to receive your lists as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday evening. Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail, attached is the short letter I originally approved to explain the situation.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Derek:  I just wanted to let you know that I will be available to help you on swap matters now that Shari has transitioned to another group.  You can always reach me at Ext. 35620.  Please let me hear from you.  Sara 
 Paul:  Did you learn anything further about the credit protection referencing Deutsche Telecom bonds? Also, Shari does not know anything about a JV with Deutsche Telecom.  Did I misunderstand you? Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is revised summary.  Also, I have asked Susan B. and Susan F. to prepare a list similar to Marie's list for delivery by the end of the day Thursday.  Sara 
 I'd love to have 2 tickets.  Sara   JANETTE ELBERTSON 03/29/2000 11:25 AM 
 Sorry for the delay.  My address is:  3915 Coleridge Houston, TX  77005  You can add "and Guest" to the invitation. Hope all is well.  Regards.  Sara

 David,  I am sending you the latest Pulp & Paper disclaimer per Sara Shackleton's request.   Kaye 
 I will need to leave the office at approximately 5 pm.  Sara 
 Close.  Credit is considering credit terms for the deal.  If executed today, we'll have to do a Deemed ISDA and simultaneously send out a draft ISDA for negotiation.  Do you have a deal ticket already?  I understand it's a 7-year deal.  SS 
 Thanks for your help!  I'll let you know what I learn.  SS 
 Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment. 
 Please print for David.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the language which should replace (i) in the Additional Provisions.  Also, in your part (ii) [now part (iii)], the words "Fixed Price" should be capitalized each time used.  Also, you should add the following sentence to numbered paragraph "1" on the first page:  "Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to said terms in the Agreement." 
 Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized). Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. Also, let's have lunch.  Sara 
 Attached is the revised letter agreement between EES and Enron Corp. 
 Is there a call in the morning?  Everyone will be in Houston.  Sara 
 (1)  The term "Threshold Amount" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., "Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets the threshold level and we input that number into the document.  (2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her number is X34737.  SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 You'll handle? 
 Sorry I can't help. Also, you know that legal will be out of the office from Wed. afternoon through the end of the week.  Are there any pressing items?  Sara 
 Am reviewing now.  SS 
 Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:  (1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]  (2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ through 4/29/11]  (3)  Currency Swap between "ECT" and "Sutton Bridge" booked 3/29/00 [ through 3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.  I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara (X35620) 
 Jarrod:  that language works fine.  Sara    Enron North America Corp. 
 (1)  Commonwealth Bank (in Australia) (2)  EPM ECHO Ltd.  Also, I need to have your respose to Statoil which I left on your voice mail. And, further, are you looking into Deutsche Bank?  I'll be checking voice mail while I'm in San Antonio.  I gave the credit group in Houston Thursday and Friday off.  Sara 
 I'm working on it.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail.  I have not heard a word.  SS 
 I didn't see any codes on your website.  I am interested in pricing the following:  Vulcano by Magistretti Konx by Arad Eco and Eco Due by von Kline Manta by Semprini (small size) Flexuoso by Vigna  Thank you.  Sara Shackleton 
 "Following Business Day Convention" means the convention for adjusting any relevant date if it falls on a day that is not a Business Day (when commercial banks settle payments is USD in N.Y., for our purposes) to the first following day that is a Business Day or a trading day for the relevant floating price source.  I hope I have given you a simple description.    Enron North America Corp. 
 Susan:  I didn't see this on the master list.  Can you locate the request? Sara 
 Susan:  Could you please create a blackline and fax to Cargill.  Marie already made most of the changes.  Thanks.  Sara ps - file is on your chair 
 Flowers and lunch sounds good.  SS 
 I know they approved the opinion but it is redundant.  I'll show you what I think should be changed.  SS 
 Are you going to respond to David? Has this Master been executed?  Sara 
 Brent:  Andrea Calo has not joined our phone conference.  Randy want to know if you have a deal sheet for him.  Sara 
 David:  Hope you got back home alright!  I'll follow up if Shari is unable. Also, did you tell me that you had a copy of some type of Australian financial policy memo and/or trading guidelines for the Australian market? 
 David:  Please give me another day to review your email.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Just a heads up!  ENA has finalized our Master Swap Agreement with Statoil. You may recall that Statoil would now like to execute an agreement with ECTRIC using the ENA agreement as a model.  I have been dealing with the Statoil inhouse lawyer whose name is Chuck O'Brien.  Regards.  Sara 
 Attached are copies of the drafts sent to ABN AMRO Incorporated in January, 2000.   I have been out of town and apologize for the delay.  Sara 
 Sorry, I filled out the form and sent it to HR.  It was difficult to rank the candidate using the printed form but I thought she looked very good and after speaking with Elizabeth to get her impressions (which I have not done), I would probably make her an offer.  Sara 
 please respond 
 Marie:  Sutton Bridge was sold.  That is all I know.  Following is the situation regarding outstanding swaps.  We need to keep a record somewhere. Sara 
 Marlene,  I am Sara Shackleton's assistant.  The contact information you have for Sara is partially correct.  The email address you have is correct but she has an additional address if it is easier to remember.  It is Sara.Shackleton@enron.com.  The following are the correct mailing addresses:  Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX 77002-7361  Dir:   713-853-5620 Fax:  713-646-3490  P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188  If you need any additional information, my email address is Kaye.Ellis@enron.com  Regards,  Kaye 
 Sure.  Also, this confirm needs to be tracked b/c counterparty needs to fulfill a condition for ECT.  SS 
 As you may know, Project Ghost was unwound eff. 3/31/00.  I believe that Project MacArthur was also unwound. (but I haven't seen anything).  Also, Project Blackbird is in the process of being unwound.  Each will have a Swap Termination Agreement.  Brenda Funk should be organizing closing docs. Please make necessary entries on Lotus Notes and keep supporting documentation in the files.  I don't see Projects Ghost, Spector or Hawaii on Lotus Notes (these show up on your status of files list to Mark.  Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Chris:  I left voice mails for both Tracy Ngo and Tanya Rohauer about Delano.  I've had no response.  SS 
 Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review Kris's fax   If you have your own form, please send and we can review.  Sara 
 Julia:  To close the loop, it appears that none of the swaps were terminated.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Please per my voice mail, let's sit down in my office and catch up because there are a lot of loose ends on the brokerage side (particularly with Marie leaving).  I can address you emails (current and past) at that time.  Thanks.  Sara 
 David:  Attached is an example of the "tainted swaption".  I'd really like to focus on the dates (Trade, Effective, Exercise).  Looking forward to call in the morning.  Sara 
 We are very short on legal help at the moment.  Please permit me to respond to your request early next week with an acceptable time.  Thank you.  Sara 
 Has this ever been finalized? 
 Taffy told me that Susan's husband had court this morning so she is late.  Is this weird or am I weird?  Sara 
 I am still waiting to hear whether ENA will transact with [Soc Gen] today (or whether Enron Australia will document its first weather trade).  SS 
 Attached is a suggested form of opinion.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 That will be fine.  SS 
 ENA has a multibranch ISDA master with Soc Gen.  SS 
 After "Written Confirmation of Notice of Exercise", add the following:  "Seller's facsimile number for purposes of giving notice:"                      [we need a person and fax number because the master refers only to 'President" and 440-449-9868]    Jarrod:  is the counterparty asking for a special type of delivery (I wouldn't think so) 
 FYI only 
 Do you have a phone number?  thanks 
 Susan:  In Marie's absence, could you please send Paul Simons a copy of the Statoil master?   Thanks.  SS 
 Yes, I need the chart to reflect EACH MONTH during the term of the transaction.  Sara 
 left you a voice mail.   Have we ever done a basis swap with Phibro or the UK entitiy?  What is the payment date?  This deal concluded about a month ago. SS 
 Attached is a new credit worksheet for Capex.  SS 
 Kaye:  Don't worry about credit.  Please focus on confirms/settlements.  Tana will handle global contracts.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye will update the confirm/settlement list and send out the email.  Do you want her to handle global contracts or will you?  Sara 
 Marie:  I would like to schedule a meeting with you and others to review the agreement process, your contacts, account information, record retention (physical files and Lotus Notes), reporting procedures, any forms which you have developed and helpful tips.  I know that you are working on a memo which will address this information and it would be extremely helpful if we could learn from your experience. I would also like to discuss Ted Murphy's expectations.  I think this will take about an hour.  Please give me a suggested time during the week.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 nothing attached 
 FYI only.  It looks like this trade will be done by EAF. 
 I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.  The initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.  On a slightly different note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review work in progress, issues, products, etc.?  If so, who should be included? Thanks.  Sara 
 Had a conversation with PG&E this afternoon and we're almost finished.  Just a few loose ends to tie up.  Sara 
 After our meeting, I also agreed to provide suggested language for hedge funds.  It is attached. 
 Transfer.  Section 7 is hereby amended by adding the following Subsection (c): "(c)  Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate so long as the obligations of such Affiliate are guaranteed by Enron Corp. pursuant to a guaranty substantially similar to the one provided on behalf of Party A, provided that such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default."  Rod and I will follow up on the Letter of Credit issues.  Have a nice weekend.  Regards.  Sara 
 Attached is the latest Cadwalader draft memo addressing additional risks posed by newer, illiquid products (specifically paper and pulp) and minimization of the risks.  My goal is for  the paper and pulp group to adopt the recommendations.  Please take a look at the memo and give me your comments.  I would like to respond to Cadwalader by the middle of next week. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Has Taffy finalized the confirm "hotline" solution?  The paralegals have no plan other than to rely on the confirm desk to call a live person. 
 Bob:  I left you a voice mail last week about a lunch that legal would like to present next month for both groups (above).  We need a list of settlements persons who should be invited.  The purpose of the meeting is to provide an overview of the legal documentation process, including explanations of our documents, and encourage dialogue among the groups.  Please send as soon as possible.  Also, let me know if you have any particular topics which you would like to see addressed.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Settlements cannot attend a May 5 lunch (but could do May 12).  Can we switch Credit to May 5?  SS 
 Please hold these names until we can agree on a date for this luncheon. Thanks.  SS 
 Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS 
 If the letter is alright, I can have it printed formally.  I never heard back from Gareth with respect to any comments.  Just let me know what you would like to do.  Sara 
 Have you ever sent a credit worksheet for EWEB?  Holli Krebbs requested this again in mid-March.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Could you please prepare a 2-way C.A.  in connection with a consulting arrangement between ENA and Dr. Haigh.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is an updated list of issues based upon our meeting of July 2, 1999. 
 FYI 
 FYI 
 Jeff:  Per my voice mail, please let me know if Friday, May 12 is an acceptable date for your group.  This works fine for Settlements.  Thanks. Sara 
 I am attaching my report but will be unable to join the meeting as I have a regularly scheduled meeting at that time.  Sara 
 Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.  I would like to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time. I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times. Thanks.  Sara 
 Marie is updating her list and preparing a general memorandum in connection with the brokerage and futures agreements.  I have the following times available to meet (and I think we should schedule about an hour):  Thursday between 1:30 and 3:15 Friday   after 10 am  Please let me know as soon as possible of your preference and I'll try to accommodate everyone.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya will come to my office at 1:30 to discuss revision of the worksheet. Hope you can make it!  SS 
 Please invite the swap, confirmation, settlements groups.  The topic will be "an overview of the swap documentation process" and there are lots of new faces in all  Please ask participants to submit any issues they would like addressed, including specific confirmation or settlement issues. 
 Mark:  I left you voice mail last week regarding a due authorization opinion from ENA to Statoil (for execution of a master).  Will you or Haedicke sign?  Also, who signs an enforceability opinion (under either NY or Texas law)?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Of course I received this except that it arrived at 9:40pm last night.  The mansion was FAB! and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.  I am currently into Danish modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems (which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw "Run, Lola, Run" which is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she could check her stock portfolio periodically.  I spoke with Daddy this morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME when you get this message.  Sass    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Per my voice mail.  I think Suzanne already reserved a room. 
 Tanya:  the Morgan lawyer called about putting ISDA Master Agreements in place with the following Enron entities:  Enron Canada Corp. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. (trading UK nat gas) Enron Liquid Fuels Inc.   (trading propane)  She indicated that guaranties were all about to expire in June. All of Morgan's commodity business is being centralized in the above Morgan entity. Please let me know how you are going to handle this in case Beth Ng calls me back.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gosh, I guessed right!!!! 
 Mark:  I know that David Minns has been sending copies of executed agreements to Alan.  These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.  We need to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to have access to our database.  Do you want to speak with Alan or should I? Also, on a related issue, do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master Agreements in Houston?  Would this be necessary in an emergency situation? Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Susan:  You were going to verify whether the ABN AMRO futures agreement should be executed by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. (or ENA with Shane acting pursuant to the Services Agreement).  Please let me know so that either David or I can move forward on the futures agreement.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Do you have the short information sheet/request that you threw together for Enron company requests for brokerage agreements?  This would be helpful when we meet.  I am shooting for Friday at 10 am.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Marty:  Also left you a voice mail.  Are we ready to send execution copies? Sara 
 Rod:  Is this one ready to go?  Please talk to Susan.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Left you a voice mail. Check with Stacy or Jeff.  Is Janice back? 
 Paul:  Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.  Now for the real issues:  could you send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit derivatives in the UK?  Also, are there any other materials which might be helpful in the credit derivatives area?  Shari has passed this on to me and I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month. Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  I haven't heard a peep about this deal until this email.  You may want to check with someone on the weather desk.  SS 
 Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA and calculation of the "Credit Support Amount," our change should not create any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number.  The only reason for "specifying otherwise" in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be "the higher of" the amount calculated (deemed to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara 
 yes 
 Please review and let's discuss.  SS 
 Mark:  How should we handle this?  In the past, I have provided Andrea Bertone with Elizabeth Sager's latest (and evolving) physical trading forms which Tozzini has used as a starting point.  Sara 
 I'm tied up from 1-3. 
 The meeting has been moved to 1:30 - 2:30, Thursday, April 20 in Conference Room 38C1. 
 Here's the email I just sent.  If you can't find a conference room nearby (same elevator bank), I'll opt for my office. 
 Won't you miss Alec? 
 a basis swap?  A CFD is merely a swap! 
 By the way, did you resolve Zachary's "fund" issue?  Sas ps  I'm going to call you when I get a break.  I learned that I have a ticket to the game on Sat.  Oh, joy! 
 Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info. I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara 
 We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara 
 I have engaged the Modrall firm in Albuquerque to help us sort through the legal issues posed by dealing with the Southern Utes both on and off line. The lawyers are Messrs. Lynn Slade and Bill Scott.  I would like to send a Fed Ex to them on Friday, April 21 for Monday morning delivery containing the following:  1.  ISDA Master Agreement and CSA boilerplate 2.  Our municipal form of Schedule for the Southern Utes and appropriate Paragraph 13 3.  A sample Schedule prepared for a general corporate (with appropriate disclaimer language) 4.  A copy of the 1993 Commodity Definitions and the 2000 Supplement  You will have to verify the current firm name.  Check the website at www.modrall.com. Send to the attention of Bill Scott.  The address:  500 4th Street NW, Suite 1000 Albuquerque, New Mexico  87102 
 Chuck:  We are getting the package together for you.  Sara 
 Mark:  Nice to meet you too!  When Credit sends us the creditworksheet, we can generate an ISDA master to send to the counterparty.  Sara 
 FYI 
 I am ready to finalize the letter agreement.  Please verify that Jeff McMahon will sign for Enron Corp.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid. Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.  Remember, we have already given in on "affiliate setoff".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) issue until this week!]  Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided to issue transferable L/C's.  Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this is a deal breaker. 
 Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).  Apparently we were dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just let me know.  Sara 
 Please put on my calendar with respect to "POLAND" 
 I have an early afternoon appointment.  Sara 
 Thanks so very much.  Sara 
 Please send the current DRAFT to the User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions to my attention.  I understand that these can be sent to reply mail.  You can reach me by phone at 713/853-5620 if you have any problems.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton [Enron North America Corp.] 
 A message from my crazy sister! 
 Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon. He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with Ron?  Love, Sara 
 the closing checklist contains the sub-trusts for Hawaii 
 attached are swap docs for the Hawaii transaction 
 Michelle:  Could you please send me the latest form of agreement that ENA should be using with its outside consultants?  Thanks.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Sara 
 Is it possible to obtain a copy of the draft "User's Guide to 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions" today?  I would very much appreciate receipt as soon as possible.  Enron is a member of ISDA.   Thanks again.  Sara Shackleton 
 no changes since last week 
 Let's schedule a time to talk.  Sara 
 Please let Randy know that I have another meeting scheduled at that time. Thanks.  Sara 
 No, but we add different provisions to the Master Agreement  for commodity trades and currency/rate trades. 
 Believe it or not, we are almost done but PG&E's lawyer has been so busy that we were unable to schedule a call last week.  I will send her some suggested comments (tonight) and we are trying to speak this week.  There aren't any problems.  Sara 
 FYI new request.  What about our master tax agreement? 
 Do you need to pass this on to Greg? 
 Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online trading operation.  His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the next 30 days (but not trade).  I told Harry that I would need to review the agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future. We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.  Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement "as is" for the limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of terminating the agreement when he is done.  Although ENA would have a password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to assist?].  Please let me know your decision.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Ed:  Jason Peters is an A&K lawyer working with us for about six weeks and he's helping on these agreements.  We would like to meet with you about these lenders and update ENA's position.  Could you please send me the "comparison chart" which you prepared for these banks and ED&F Mann and Paribas, and let me know when you are available to meet?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Wednesday afternoon works fine for me.  Sara 
 Jeff:  I have not heard a word from credit.  Who did you speak with?  Please let me know and I will follow up.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Do I have to diall in for this conference call? 
 Julian, 5 pm BA time is 3 pm Houston.  Before we speak, please verify that Rod will be available at 3 pm Houston. 
 I'm not impressed.  Sara 
 I have doctors' appointments from 10:30 am - 3 pm on Friday. 
 Rod and Tanya:  Please let me know who is handling so I can pass on the news to Jeff.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara 
 I have to leave the office by 10:45 am.  That should be enough time.  SS 
 Does anyone have any ISDA comparisons that I can give to Jason?  Sara 
 Pls add to my calendar.  SS 
 Neither Susan has any comparisons.  Flynn eagerly volunteered amendments she's got lying around.  I'm indifferent although I wonder if Flynn is simply trying to use the system. 
 BY THE WAY, your voice mail does not work!  If your phone calls roll over to an assistant or I try to leave you a voice mail, I cannot get there!  Please call or stop by.  Sara 
 Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999 memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?  I would like to discuss your analysis and any further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.  I have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.  I'm not sure if we'll get there. I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or externally.  Sara 
 Robert:  Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of the first part of the first sentence in the "Setoff" language.  I just wanted to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase "Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff ...;provided, however," actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early Termination Date.  What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the setoff provision?  Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620. Thanks.  Sara 
 I used the wrong email address! 
 Per my voice mail, attached is draft letter. 
 Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about the guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format. Also, I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a "General Guarantee Agreememt" on behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) on January 28, 1998.  Which format are you interested in using?  Our cap for financial transactions with PG&E is, I believe, $10 million.  Please give me a call as I am the first point of contact for negotiating the guaranty.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Joe:  Per my voice mail, see part (iii) of the above and please revise to provide accurate description of the condition to which you agreed with MediaNews.  Just to say "ENA closes on the KPM Lasara L.P. newsprint mill" is not sufficient.  Sara 
 If you send the letter, please forward a copy to me.  SS 
 Jason:  I still cannot access your voice mail (isn't your extension 34454?) If I'm right, please have your assistant look into this. Can we put these two brokerage agreements (below) at the top of your list? 
 Sheila:  Paul Radous (Ext. 58356) in credit will be monitoring brokerage accounts from a credit perspective.  I have provided him with an overview of the "process".  When he has had an opportunity to digest the information, I think it would be helpful to meet with Paul.  In the meantime, would you please begin to copy Paul on all messages to Ted Murphy regarding the purpose of new accounts.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  What is this all about?  Are you still going to decide credit issues for the ISDA?  Sara 
 Tanya:  Yes, there is an outstanding issue.  Please read the attached and let me know when you'd like to discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Can you eat lunch at 11:45?  SS 
 Is that desk doing options (NOT SWAPTIONS!)?  Why are you asking?  There are many issues on the paper desk regarding options.  Sara 
 Abbey:  On March 29, you left me a voice mail in connection with the foregoing.  Please call me at 713/853-5620 for an update and to answer you questions.  There is not much left to do.  Thanks.  Sara Shackleton 
 Mark:  Thus far, I have uncovered only one "nondocumented" electronic agreement.  The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and broker dealers.  There is no agreement for this matching service.  I am not aware of other "matching services" and whether any agreements are in place. Let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks.  Sara 
 ENA  sent execution copies of the ISDA to Kellogg Company on April 10.  By copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies of our documents for use in your negotiations.  Let  me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 I have a morning appointment and will be in afterwards.  Sara 
 Rod:  You may recall that we spoke about upgrading the old Master Energy Price Swap to an ISDA.  Can you please send a new credit worksheet?  If you are not handling, please let me know who to nag.  Thanks.  Sara 
 (1) In connection with Taffy's report, please note the following: Aquila Canada Corp. - follow up Christiania Bank - need to send for execution Ospraie - send revisions  (2) Also, what have you heard from Laurie about the Australian ISDA's and brokerage agreements?  We should begin incorporating into our database.  If we use your assistant, we should input data during the regular business day.  (3) I have Jason helping me on about seven different brokerage arrangements and will soon need appropriate backup to send together with execution copies.  I am keeping dummy files until these are finalized. 
 Kaye:  Would you please schedule a meeting with John Suttle to discuss Harvard.  One hour will be fine.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal back to back transaction with the "booking" Enron affiliate)  for which the "booking" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services agreement.  Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove described arrangement? 
 That's fine but I have to leave shortly before 5 tomorrow.  Sara 
 I want to have the Canadian lawyer finalize docs in a timely manner.  Please advise me of your plans.  Thanks,  Sara 
 I'm on the conference call now.  John Novak suggested that you, he and Frederico speak.  It sounds like commercial and credit need to iron this out together.  John is in his office now and the call usually takes about an hour.  Sara 
 and I also need a file for:  Goldman Sachs & Co. electronic agreement 
 Mark:  Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.  Just one more question, please:  is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English law?  How often do you negotiate to the contrary?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hey, Julian!  Susan is working on it now.  SS 
 AFAC and Marcelo:  I hope this message finds you both well.  I would like to finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a "baseline" for future updates.  Please feel free to date the matrix as of December, 1999, if you wish.  Please forward any recent changes to me for comment  and I will respond immediately.  Then we can move on to other things!  Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.  Regards.  Sara 
 Thanks for the redraft!  I am looking at the agreement now.  Also, I thought you would be interested in Mark's comment.  I would like to use arbitration in lieu of jurisdiction.  Please make that change and forward to me.  I will mark up with comments.  Thanks so much for your help.  Sara 
 Please follow up with counterparty for executed doc and enter into Lotus Notes.  INSIST on commercial help now if there's a problem. 
 (1)  Please change Consolidated Papers Inc. to "medium" priority. (2)  Please follow up on James Hardie and enter into Lotus Notes. 
 Susan:  Would you please follow up with Bridgeline now as I am preparing a futures agreement for them!  We need them to get their act together. Thanks.  Sara 
 This applies to all counterparties! 
 Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the Payee).  So here's my recommendation:  (1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be based upon satisfaction that "nondisputed" amounts having been paid by the DP.  Will he also raise the "other agreements" issue here?  Not a clue.  (2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)  (3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A as applying to "other agreements between the parties".  But Cargill proposed part A and it DOES apply to "other agreememts between the parties."  I don't want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this again with Marty.  Thanks for your continued help.  Sara 
 Hi, Sami!  Sorry we missed the call yesterday.  I just wanted to update you on some of the financial trading issues in Brazil (and I have added you to the working group list).  I am going to finalize our "swap matrix" for Brazil.  On the physical trading side, I had asked a physical trading lawyer to call you and am wondering if Elizabeth Sager ever called or emailed. Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 That will be fine.  Sara 
 Edward:  See attached revision (and please copy me if sent).  Thanks.  SS 
 Roy:  Call me and let's coordinate.  Sara 
 Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman. Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please put attached in the SITA file.  The ISDA parties are ENA and SITA. Michael Khajeh-No in the London office will be negotiating this agreement with SITA on behalf of ENA. 
 Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly. Thank you for your help.  Sara 
 Susan:  for the SITA file. 
 Tana:  Please see Sami's message below.  Is there something you can send?  SS 
 Attached is a form (NOT OFFICIALLY APPROVED) for use with the omnibus.  It is different from the version which you e-mailed to me earlier.  SS 
 Barbara:  Ted Murphy asked if we would negotiate a futures agreement (for Bridgeline) with Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  You may recall that we previously handled the ADM Investor Services, Inc. futures arrangement for Bridgeline. Sara 
 Kim:  Thanks for your call.  Legal received credit for Tuscon on 5/1/00 from Ed Sacks.  Susan Flynn is preparing the ISDA agreement to send to the counterparty.  Let me know if you have any other questions. Sara  Susan:  Please let Kim know when the draft will be sent.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  I would like to have this agreement (all three parts) executed early Monday and faxed to Goldman.  Gary Hickerson can sign for Enron North America Corp. together with Ted Murphy as the second signatory.  Please prepare an addendum or annex for the Client Access Agreement with the following inserts for Paragraph 9:  INSERT 1 to Paragraph 9(g) after the word "enjoined":  "upon proof of any such breach"  INSERT 2 which will replace the second and third sentences in Paragraph 9(h) :  "Any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be resolved pursuant to the ARBITRATION provision contained in Schedule A to this Agreement."  For purposes of the password ID application, we must verify that Harry Arora is still authorized to trade for ENA (and employed by ENA).  Roy Ibasco is coordinating for Harry.  After signing, we can fax to Goldman and I have the fax info.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail. 
 clean copy of fax I left for you on Friday.  Sara 
 Ted:  Later this morning, we will be sending the Goldman electronic agreement for execution.  Harry Arora will be the only "trader" authorized to receive a password for ENA.  We will ask Harry to advise us when he is finished and can then terminate (if we wish) once Harry has reviewed the website for Enron Networks.  Thanks.  Sara 
 In connection with the "upgrading" of these old ERMS masters, I have limited information which Jeff Nogid (X34782) will verify.  Please verify spelling of names, addresses, etc.  Morgan Guaranty Trust - legal is Michael Stolfi (212-648-8231) or the trader is Henry Stuart (212-648-9057) Morgan Stanley - Jeff will get the info today  We should include a cover letter in each indicating the reason why we are submitting.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Sara 
 I will deliver a new version which you can "fix" and send to Elizabeth.  SS 
 Scott:  Thanks for the delivery.  I didn't receive anything last week.   Sara 
 Attached is a "high volume" counterparty list for two categories.  With respect to the first category, Carol is handling BPAmoco and I am speaking with Cargill.  Should we address Neumin?  And should we actively try to replace existing ECT masters with ISDA's?  Sara 
 Call me. 
 Trena:  Can you please let me know if the docs from Chase are to amend the existing Repo Agreement between ENA and Chase?  What type of transactions will you be doing with Chase?  The docs I received are from a woman named Monica Turner and she has not returned my phone call.  She did not provide an email address so I don't know how to get in touch with Chase.  Can you help? Maybe get me another name?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sami:  Attached are the most recent ENA power trading agreements.  Parts of the agreements may be useful to you and/or Jose Emilio (or whomever you are working with).  Tozzini began with the earlier ENA template.  Please forward any translated trading docs to my attention.  Thanks.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Sara 
 Jeff:  Are there any  issues that I might address that would be particularly useful or timely for your group?  Sara 
 Bob:  Are there any issues that might be useful for your goup that I should address?  Also, I would like to chat with you about settlements on multiple trades.  An interesting issue was raised in our credit lunch last week. Please let me know when you are available.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Per my voice mail, can you make headway with these two companies? We have not heard back from either.  I think that there needs to be a commercial push.  Please call if you have any questions or if I can help further.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tana:  When will the database be ready for companywide access?  Sara 
 Tana:  I added several brokerage agreements to the database yesterday and all ended up in the "Other Agreements" section.  Except for one, which is an "electronic trading agreement".  Can I call our developer?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hi, Andrea!  Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by ENA.  I thought these may be useful.  I have forwarded these already to Sami.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent English translation of a current deal.  Regards.  Sara 
 Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots going on! I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else? Please send me an e-mail.  These issues are arising because of my involvement in working with the Brazilian office.  Thanks.  Looking forward to speaking to you soon.  Sara 
 It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these are below.  You can handle the rest, I think.  Also, he jumped on the L/C removal language that we discussed.  [references are to numbered paragraphs below] (2)  OK (5)  Did you ever receive a response from Rhett? (7)  Per already responded to you.  Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel. (11)  These are two separate issues.  Short of a conversation, it sounds like he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages. The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination based upon failure to pay. (12)  Need to be consistent for both parties. (14)  Is he right? (15)  Verify with Rod. (17)  I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I? (19)  Check with Rod and I'll also review. 
 Susan:  I have given this to Jason.  SS 
 David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with any questions you may have with respect to the following items:  (1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the agreement and Susan is out until May 22. (2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I could view).  There is no problem with the deal. (3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO (Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate jurisdiction. (4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries?  I'll speak with you later.  Regards.  Sara 
 Jarrod:  Attached is a "form" letter for you to send (with adjustments as indicated) or let me know and I will sign and send with the Vitol confirms. Separately, I have faxed to you the first page changes.  Call if you have questions.  Please be sure that we have included the additional reps.  Sara 
 I would only add the ongoing cash collateral issue in Canada (and run spell check). 
 We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition is done.  The contact is:  Gary Ordway 830 N.E. Holladay Suite 200 Portland, Oregon  97232 
 You are right!  Sorry about that. 
 It's true!  I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!  I may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.  But I will call before the weekend.  Sara 
 Marie is fine with either Friday June 2 or 9.  So let's pick June 2 unless someone has a conflict.  For quick planning (invitations, caterer, limo, etc.), who wants to help?  Sara 
 Carol St. Clair has the VEPCO proposed guaranty in hand and will contact you soon.  Thanks for reminding me.  Sara 
 Sheila:  We are still working with our developer to open up access to Gary's group (read-only).  Should I include all of the names on your February 2000 org chart?  Delete some?  Add some?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Would you please handle.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of signature documents comprises four pieces: (1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border) (2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you] (3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 12 paragraphs] (4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]  When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete package with all four parts.  The two emails which you previously received probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally remove this wording.  Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to dot the "i's"  and cross the "t's".  Thanks.  Sara 
 I just learned that I have a conflict on June 2.  So I have already consulted with Marie who has agreed to Friday, June 9.  I hope this works for the majority of the group.  Thanks.  Sara 
 At end of first paragraph, add:  Terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have such meaning as set forth in the Agreement.  Insert in "Credit or Other Special Provisions":  On or before 5:00 p.m. (Houston time) on Wednesday, May 17, 2000, Counterparty shall deliver to ENA Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000  which amount shall be maintained in favor of ENA in accordance with the terms of Annex A to the Agreement and which may be aggregated together with other amounts required for other Transactions subject to the Agreement in order to establish a single Letter of Credit.  Further, at any time during the term of this Transaction, upon the request of ENA in its sole discretion, Counterparty shall deliver additional Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000, subject to the provisions of the foregoing sentence.  In addition to such Performance Assurance, Counterparty shall establish, maintain, renew, substitute and increase such Performance Assurance in accordance with the terms and provisions of Annex A to the Agreement and the failure to do so shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 5A(6) of the Agreement.

 Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.  There is a 60 day true up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.  Upon notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.  This language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be identical.  We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation. Please call if you have any questions.  Sara  P.S.  you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is for a cross-border transaction 
 Tana:  I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em (marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599. Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Monica:  Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send me the entire format for the European format for the repos.  Also, have you had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) dated as of January 29, 1998?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 Will send the MARKUP of the Axel Johnson Inc. guaranty later today.  I have inserted several provisions.  SS     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Jarrod:  Just in case you needed the online version of the confirm.  I will fax my markup to you.  Sara 
 Mark:  I've been asked whether ENA can enter into derivatives with an Indian company.  Do you have research regarding legality/enforceability since the 1997 global review which ENA conducted through Allen & Overy?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Laurel:  Can you send the deal ticket for this transaction?  Sara 
 Rob:  Have you ever directly engaged counsel in New Guinea?  I have searched our jurisdictional database but to no avail.  I only find Australian firms with New Guinea associations.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Just received this on Brazil (financial) 
 Frank:  Have you ever hired New Guinea counsel? I need to engage a firm to answer derivatives issues. Thanks.  Sara 
 Rick:  Both Greg and John are traveling.  I did receive a voice mail from John advising that the deal has been delayed.  I don't have details.  John will try to call you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hope you had a great vacation!  Please let me know when you have some time so that we can talk about Brazil.  I'm trying to update the info that Yao left me and I am now being called by Gary Hickerson's group for a progress report.  Sara 
 Tana:  Please provide the following individuals with Lotus Notes access. Thanks.  Sara 
 [You'll need to amend the credit worksheet to reflect changes]  "Threshold" means with respect to Party A, unlimited; provided however, that the Threshold for Party A shall be U.S. $5,000,000 upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Material Adverse Change, and the Threshold for Party A shall be zero upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default with respect to Party A.  "Threshold" means with respect to Party B, unlimited; provided however, that the Threshold for Party B shall be U.S. $3,000,000 upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Material Adverse Change; and the Threshold for Party B shall be zero upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default with respect to Party B or upon execution of any Transaction pursuant to this Agreement having a term greater than or equal to one (1) year. 
 Monica:  Thanks for the form.  I can verify that Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., now Enron North America Corp.

 As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley situation:  (1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. This is the entity for commodity trading. (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97  (2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions  (3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need this one?  Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.  Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in legal (Cap Services) will let me know.  I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Rod:  I will contact Frederick Broda (VP, Derivatives and Fixed Income) in NY about this master.  Jeff Nogid requested this master as well.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please put on my calendar 
 Rod:  Jeff Nogid has also requested an ISDA Master Agreement with the foregoing party for equity and fixed income deals.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark and Paul:  ENA has just finalized an ISDA Master Agreement with Statoil.  I had advised you several months ago that Statoil also wanted to negotiate with ECTRIC, using the ENA agreement as a model.  Chuck O'Brien is the inhouse counsel and can be reached via email or phone (203/978-6988). Please contact Chuck and let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Regards.  Sara  Chuck:  Mark and Paul can be reached in London at 011-44-20-7783-6552 (Mark) and 011-44-20-7783-6566 (Paul). 
 Jarrod:  attached are comments to the confirm.  Please note that you must reference the KPM transaction in the Additional Provisions section, part (iv).  Sara 
 Michael and Deepak:  Attached are the execution copies of the documents signed with ENA.  If I have missed anything, please contact Susan Flynn (as Marie Heard is now with EBS).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hello there!  I know that you are out of the country.  Thanks for forwarding the message from Andre Cangucu.  I have been through your materials but do not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., "Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil", "Trading with Brazilian Counterparties", etc.).  Am I missing something?  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Sara 
 Rod:  attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s group.  I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it was minimal.  How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?  Also, do we want agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding, Inc.)?  Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?  Please call to chat when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Shari:  I see that you added this to the legal/credit list.  Can you tell me why?  What type of deal do we do?  Did ECTI ever transact with DLJ Capital Funding, Inc. (for distressed loans)?  Are you familiar with the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. "standard terms and conditions"? Did you ever document a loan derivative?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please add to the list of masters to be drafted.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  Barbara Gray and Shonnie Daniel worked on a Q1 deal between Enron and Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an "understanding" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.  Are you interested in pursuing this request?  Sara 
 Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.  I have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience in the confirmation area).  What do you think?  Sara 
 Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea.  Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?  Sara 
 Kelly:  ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX trading through the Bank One broker.  Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard Master Note with Bank One?  I'd like to see what's been previously negotiated.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please remove Mark Taylor from the distribution list and insert my name and email address.  Thank you. 
 I have two questions:  (1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, won't Greg Johnston need a "short course" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.  (2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch. 
 Sara left you a voice mail about this attachment. 
 Anne:  Thanks for your voice mail.  We would like to generate the master. I'll try to have it emailed on Monday.  Regards.  Sara 
 Maryann:  I left you a voice mail the other day regarding two typos in the agreement and never received corrected pages.  The Guarantee has been executed.  However, the agreement is awaiting the initials of Rod Nelson (credit) who is on vacation until Wednesday.  Will you send corrected pages for insertion in the document? 
 Frank:  Have you had any luck?  Sara 
 Susan:  I am told that the name of the Enron company is "Enron Investments PLC" and Lance Schuler set it up for the acquisition.  Please check on corporate database.  I'll try to get you a contact.  SS 
 Susan:  We are going to open a futures account with Bank One.  They have also sent a give up agreement.  This message is FYI. 
 Jason:  Please review (I have others for you to see).  Also, Paul and I spoke with Cadwalader this morning.  Please continue to check the international exchanges online to see if you can locate clearinhouse rules for each exchange.  Perhaps you can also find information on the regulatory scheme for the jurisdictions.  I suspect we will have to hire outside counsel in each country to answer our concerns.  Let's talk.  SS 
 All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required: (1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership (2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation  Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Sure, later today?    Carol St Clair 05/22/2000 10:43 AM 
 Mark and Paul:  Have either of you ever reviewed clearinghouse rules with respect to clearing members for the exhanges on which we trade (in an effort to analyze our risk with respect to our brokers)?  If the answer is yes, could I have copies of any memoranda?  Please let me hear from you or whomever may have reviewed this issue.  Thank you.  Sara 
 Per my voice mail, please contact me regarding swaps and other derivative activity in Brazil.   I am replacing Yao Apasu as the Houston based trading lawyer.

 Tana:  Please review these pages for corrections and insert into original. Rod should return tomorrow and we can execute and FedEx to PG&E.  Thanks. Sara 
 I remembered!  Do we have access to the website(s) of the publications which we receive in order to do searches?  We must have a password.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies of existing brokerage accounts.  It has also been determined (in legal) that the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here for another few weeks.  I was hoping that we could all meet and put our "project" into action.  Please give me a call and suggest some time when we may meet.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Michael and Deepak:  Michael Moulton (the ENA paper and pulp trader) is extremely interested in SITA updates as often as possible.  Please make every effort to email Michael with updates at least weekly.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Michael:  Attached is FYI.  Also, I am going to pay you a visit shortly to discuss the confirm.  Sara

 Rod and Susan:  The CP's lawyer asked for a new draft so we can redraft on our new form.  Unless Rod objects, we will use the same credit.  Rod, there will be  cross default  and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we can discuss when CP returns comments.  Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and she would like to be copied on the redraft.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Yet another name to deal with!  It appears that Paul opened my original memo a day late.  Sara 
 Carol:  Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?  I don't want to duplicate work efforts.  Maybe you and I can chat during the time originally set aside for Richard (this morning).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Hello!  Please send me your fax number.  I have a list of "Final and Proposed Regulations" which needs to be updated.  I would like to fax you the list. Thanks.  Sara 
 Shari:  When you get back after vacation and have caught up, give me a call to chat about the NYISO pricing.  Elizabeth suggested that we coordinate our efforts to capture extreme pricing revisions and negative pricing issues. Our power confirms currently include a modified version of Section 7.3 (of the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions) in our omnibus confirms for price changes.  I am still tracking third party paper.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please prepare the ISDA as requested.  Sara 
 What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?    David P Dupre 05/24/2000 06:06 PM 
 Hey, Rod:  Clint has trashed Lehman Bros. (for the moment) and is doing the deal with MLI.  So, today we confirm the trade on a Deemed ISDA and have agreed to sign an ISDA within 20 days.  Would you please prepare a credit worksheet and send it down so that we can get started? Please note that we agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.  Also, you left the chart for the PATS-2000 deal in my office (you, bum!).  I do ask that you let me review this with you so that you can evaluate the credit risk.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Here's a heads up.  I haven't read the messge and don't know the timing.  I 'll sort throught it later today.  ss 
 Mark:  Please verify for me that you told Susan F. that Samantha would be responsible for the brokerage accounts when she joins us.  I wasn't certain that Susan knew and I didn't want to spring it on her.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.  (1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant? (2)  The Schedule is missing some "standard" Enron type provisions (which were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include: limitation of liability confidentiality setoff isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach. (3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration. With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere. (4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms. What eventually happens to the Trust?  Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS. Call if you need anything else.  Sara 
 I spoke with Kevin Zemp this morning and he will e-mail docs to me for review.  I'll keep you posted.  Sara 
 Susan:  would you please contact this party to see if they have comments? Jennifer says they are ready to sign.  We are having a guaranty problem and that's why this party has come up.  Please let Souad know what the response is.  Thanks.  Sara

 Kaye:  I would like to schedule a meeting for sometime after June 8 (when our new paralegal Samantha arrives) with Donna and Samantha.  We will need a conference room.  1 hour.  Taffy has Samantha's schedule.  I know she has orientation on June 8.  If Tana is "training" on June 9, 10, etc., I could borrow 1 hour.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  FYI - this is a Top Ten.  There are no entries in Lotus Notes since 5/5/00.  Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sara 
 Melissa:  We need to meet again about the templates.  Also, what is this about?  And we have to talk about Deseret.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  Can you print a list of the documents in my folders so that I can eliminate old items?  Also, am I still subject to the "backup" of documents? 
 Rod:  Forgive my redundancy, but did I already request (and did you send) a credit worksheet for this counterparty?  This is another Clint Freeland/Jeff Nogid push for Fastow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's list! 
 Attached is a new letter for the July 17 payment which ECT owes Sonoco. Please review for accuracy.  If it's OK, one of us can fax (with the settlement statement) on the payment date.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jarrod:  Please let me know when you have received the deemed ISDA doc.  SS    Jarrod Cyprow 05/26/2000 01:54 PM 
 FYI:  Michael is on a two week honeymoon.  Good luck staying on top of these guys!  Sara    Deepak Sitlani 05/30/2000 08:42 AM 
 FYI 
 Rod:  Further to my recent memo, the Tokheim debt is being transferred to DLJ (and we owe Deutsche Bank for the unwind of the loan swap).  Sara  P.S.  Who will handle credit derivatives in your absence? 
 Carol:  I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to Marie.  In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina Tice, the CP credit manager.  Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on top of Brant.  Your name is on this one.  Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.  Although Richard inquired about Palladium.  I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week (according to Tanya).  Sara 
 Rod:  And what lawyer is handling this in your presence?  This is beginning to sound like Koch and all of the Koch separate trading entities!!!!  My brain is full now. 
 I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see attached message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our weather trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490). 
 Kaye:  Please schedule about an hour with Elsa Piekielniak (X37613) in my office to discuss "new products, per her voice mail".  Thanks.  SS 
 WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? 
 FYI:  split effective for stockholders as of 7/23/99; 2 for 1; as I write this stock dropping.  Your analysis, Doctor?  SS 
 Bill:  I'll call you on Thursday, June 1 at 2pm MST.  Thanks.  Sara    "Bill C. Scott" <WCS@modrall.com> 05/30/2000 06:49 PM 
 All:  I know that credit and legal are currently stretched to the limits but pushing your credit priorities will require some coordination.  Here's a brief recap of yesterday's meeting:  ALMOST DONE:  Cargill, Idacorp, Utilicorp  BRANT:  Dynegy Canada, Occidental, Duke Energy Marketing Limited P'p  ED:  Mieco, Inc.  RUSSELL:  PanCanadian Energy Services, WPS Energy Services  TANYA:  J.Aron (we need commercial help to push this)  Please review the comments taken at each meeting and distributed to everyone.  Please use Lotus Notes to record/review activity.  We are depending on you to take needed action as required and we are doing the same.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  Please talk to either Carol or Tana.  Maybe they need commercial help to get the guaranty.  SS    Tanya Rohauer 05/31/2000 08:52 AM 
 Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara 
 Tanya:  another Vitol message 
 You'd better be back in town!  Sara    Yao Apasu@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/30/2000 03:25 PM 
 Thank you for the confirmation.  I assume that I am not charged until you ship.  Is this correct?    Don Albers <offiweb@yahoo.com> 05/31/2000 11:50 AM 
 Paul:  We'll await your credit worksheets to begin preparing the ISDA's. Thanks.  Sara 
 Hi, Susan.  Just to let you know that I will have the agreements executed by ENA once you have initialled and returned them to me.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I have not heard from Andre Cangucu (although he opened the e-mail yesterday).  I will contact him again.  I sent the index of final and draft resolutions to Andrea on July 12 for updating.  Can you schedule some time to speak with Andrea?  Thanks.  Sara 
 No credit support annex.  Enron Corp. guaranty capped at $25 million.  That's the latest (for Lehman, etc.) 
 Kaye:  Will you please print these docs for me?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  Will you please print these as well? 
 Paul:  I finally got your address right!  Why are YOU listed in the Enron Corp. address book?  Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT directory!  I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.  He will prepare a short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of this week or early next week.  Then we can decide whether additional conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.  Also, please send credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.  They divide up the booty.  We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.  She will eventually be thrown into the fray.  We'll be sending a new message to everyone in credit soon.  Thanks for your help.  Sara    Paul Radous@ENRON 05/31/2000 01:14 PM 
 Ted:  ENA, formerly Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., opened a futures account with Cargill in 1993.  I am advised that there has not been any activity with Cargill for many months.  It appears that we had subaccounts for trading crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.  We do not have any margin residing with Cargill.  Given our recent discussions regarding inactive equity accounts, I was wondering if you had given any thought to inactive futures accounts.  As of 5/23/00, I see only 13 active futures accounts.  The following accounts appear to be dormant:  (1) Bank One - I am currently negotiating to open up a margin line (2)  Cargill (3)  Daiwa Securities America (4)  Gerald Inc. (may have merged or business moved to another firm) (5)  Merrill Lynch Futures (6)  Paine Webber (7)  OM Stockholm (paper) (8)  Spear, Leeds & Kellogg  Please let me know what action you would like to take, if any, or discuss in general.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Please send to Peter Bar (he's the trader) at Merrill: pbarna@exchange.ml.com You can call him to see if you should also send to a lawyer, probably Gary Rosenblum.  Peter's phone number is 212-449-6763.  His fax is 212-738-1069. Also, I had opened a Lotus Notes entry to begin capturing information.  You will need to delete one of the entries.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Martin:  I wasn't certain if I sent you an email earlier today, but I am in need of current information regarding Swedish law, in connection with an ENA swap with a Swedish corporate.  I faxed our counsel (from the 1996 derivatives survey) Advokatfirman Vinge KB to inquire about the enforceability of arbitration in ISDA agreements between US and Swedish parties.  Do you know the answer?  Or do you have any other suggestions?  We did a trade yesterday and I'm trying to document using a deemed ISDA.  I appreciate any help.  Regards.  Sara 
 Kaye:  Attached is my message from Tuesday.  Also, please schedule an hour in my office with Melissa Murphy (31886) to discuss power confirms.  SS 
 Before I respond to Shari, I would like to chat with you, please.  Thanks. Sara 
 John:  Per my voice mail.  Please call.  Sara 
 Susan:  Please let me review changes to docs.  When will this go out the the counterparty?  Sara 
 Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.  I am attending a wedding Friday night.  I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.  Also, did you receive my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?  I'd like to finalize this agreement.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Taffy:  Did you ever deliver a recap of our Tuesday meeting to legal and credit?  Sara 
 Tanya:  my mistake.  I'll put back on.  We've signed; it's their paper.  Sara    Tanya Rohauer 06/01/2000 09:51 AM 
 Melissa:  Attached is my version.  Please call if you have any questions.  SS 
 FYI 
 Rod:  I spoke with Merrill legal and the biggest issue is the capped guaranty (particularly since Merrill expected Enron Corp. to be the counterparty) . Please call Peter Barna to discuss at 212-449-6763.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will be leaving the office at approx. 3:45 pm.  If we need to meet, please see me before that time.  Sara 
 Susan:  Fred says to send to Jerry Brunner, PO BX 737, Ignacio, CO  81127 phone is 970-563-0140 Does Suttle have another contact? 
 FYI - the following list reflects old ECT master and no master counterparties by volume (not necessarily exposure).  Sara  Tanya:  do you want all of these names on the legal/credit list? 
 Susan:  Please put in file and note changes on our paperwork.  SS ps  Did the merger trigger anything in the agreement? 
 Melissa:  Brant Reves has just confirmed for me that financial power deals in the name of Aquila will change to Utilicorp United Inc. when the ISDA Master is signed (any day now).  Of course, the confirm will be an ISDA confirm, as well.   SS 
 Susan:  you need to log this in.  I'm leaving early today.  SS 
 This evening, ECT faxed comments to counterparty's proposed ISDA to both John Joel and Douglas Marshall.  We also resent the Credit Support Annex because counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one.  John Joel called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak.  I told him to schedule a conference call because ECT was ready and was faxing comments today.  I haven't heard from him.  SS 
 In the interest of time, I have revised our draft ISDA Schedule to conform in most material respects to the 1994 (effective 1992) agreement executed between ERMS and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. ("Old ISDA").  This was done to accommadate the Merrill lawyer, Gary Rosenblum (who didn't want to read our Schedule!).  The Old ISDA is not identical to the format used by Merrill Lynch International today so I'm not sure how hard they will press for other changes.  There are two potential credit issues that I see:  (1) agreement as to the Enron Corp. guaranty cap (and possible Merrill Lynch guaranty cap) and (2) our introduction of a MAC provision in the form of an Additional Event of Default (necessary because the Old ISDA had a Credit Support Annex and this one does not).  I left a voice mail for Gary Rosenblum and asked that he let me know when he was available on Monday to talk AND to have his credit person contact Rod Nelson.  Sara  P.S.  I haven't heard from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company or Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. 
 Kaye:  Please print this message and documents.  SS 
 Tracy Ngo, Melissa Murphy, Kim Theriot, me to discuss financial power trading counterparties. Please ask Tracy if Ed Sacks or anyone else from credit should be included. 
 Carol:  Here's my "short" list of issues for Mark:  (1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7: (a) reiterate "rules" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.) (b)paralegal workload  (2)  Confirmations and need to create a "writing" multiple confirms with the same counterparty confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm? use of confirms with negative language  (3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands  (4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants  (5)  Method for shortening weather confirms  (6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments 
 Yes, please.    Kaye Ellis 06/05/2000 10:34 AM 
 Lisa:  per your voice mail, I am sending the ballot to your office for review.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Do I have to think?  Well, I say let's do it.  We'll have to monitor and if he is ever ineligible, we can cancel the agreement.  Of course, we can always decide to not transact.  SS    Russell Diamond 06/05/2000 11:34 AM 
 The saga continues 
 FYI - Leslie drafted language (based on ISDA) some time ago.  I just want to be consistent.  I left Leslie a vm. SS 
 Melissa:  I've revised your list slightly for my purposes.  Can you take a quick look?  We can refine the format tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara  p.s.  It sure looks like a lot of people have their hands on the "power correction language".  I'm meeting with Tom May this afternoon. 
 Brent, Andrea and I had a "status" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people. Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo.  It appears  that Brent is the "point person" for dealing directly with the Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be dealing frequently with Andrea). 
 Taffy:  Are we on Mark's schedule today?  Thanks.  Sara 
 I spoke with the Lehman lawyer who will call me back this evening with comments. Rod:  Daniel Goldhagen is their credit officer. 
 FYI - let's chat and decide where to go from here.  Sara 
 Edmund:  I gather from Paul Radous that these are both ECTRIC ISDA masters and transactions.  I have a November 11,1999 South African derivatives questionnaire (from Webber Wentzel Bowens).  Would you like to have a copy? Sara    Carol St Clair 06/06/2000 09:00 AM 
 John:  What's happening here?  Sara 
 Brant:  Is this really high priority (for our legal/credit discussions)?  We haven't heard from these guys since April 13.  Sara 
 Rod:  What's going on with this dudes?  They just sent me a huge agreement relating to their arrangement with the International Finance Corp. and hedging agreements.  Sara 
 For ALL options for this party, we need to revise the opening sentence to read:  "... the terms and conditions of the Transaction ... on the Trade Date specified below (the "Transaction") which is an option offered by Small Ventures USA, LLC to ENA, and accepted by ENA, pursuant to a telephone conversation between the parties." 
 I believe this to be true.  I spoke with the Utilicorp lawyer when I documented the "Australian" weather trade and discussed transfer of the weather deal to the new master. We should talk to our Aquila trader.    Tanya Rohauer 06/06/2000 06:50 PM 
 Stewart:  I'll have to review their master to be certain (and insure that there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions).  In general, there is nothing else required specifically, although we may have to add some language to the weather confirmations themselves.  Sara    Stewart Rosman 06/06/2000 05:26 PM 
 I'm swamped.  SS 
 Please see attached.  Also, I need to speak with you about brokerage business - it's exceeding swap/derivative work.  Sara 
 Foiled again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Yao Apasu@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 06/06/2000 07:36 PM 
 You're always sending me stuff 
 FYI.  Also, I'll look at the agreement.  Sara 
 Jason:  fyi.  Also, Randy Curry did call me yesterday but wasn't available when I returned the call. Also, let's get Sakura Dellsher executed (and we should create a file since we're noting the ADM agreement which we did for Bridgeline).  Could we please talk this afternoon about outstanding agreements?  ss 
 All:  please see the attached.  Also, I left a detailed message for Lauren Hagerty last night but haven't anything.  Sara 
 Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.  We're very close. Tanya:  Can you tell me what products we trade? Are there many outstanding transactions?  Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is current.  It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry Donovan!!!!!).  This must be wrong. 
 Susan:  Please fax a copy of Rule 35.1(b)(2) to James Coiley (outside counsel).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  John sent the email to all paralegals after he and I spoke in the morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.  I remember, now, I checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister ( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle this one.   I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd have enough time to review. The rest is history.  Sara 
 The AAA program was Credit Lyonnais.    Tanya Rohauer 06/07/2000 03:47 PM 
 Greetings!  Hope there's no confusion about my role in Brazil.  I'm replacing Yao Apasu in the derivatives area and I thought he was more involved in the process than he apparently was.  I'll be taking direction from Brent and will be available as needed.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I will have to leave shortly before 5 pm on Thursday. Also, on Friday, I will have to leave around 4 pm to be home for the FOOD delivery! 
 This is the account we can begin working on now.  We need to meet (maybe you can drop by).  Sara 
 FYI 
 I'll get to this later today.   Call if you have immediate issues.  Sara    "Ho, Wendy" <who@velaw.com> 06/08/2000 05:15 PM 
 David:  check out the second attachment.  Thanks, as always.  Sara 
 I haven't forgotten.  We've been short staffed and swamped.  Sara    John Viverito@ENRON 06/08/2000 03:54 PM 
 We are in the process of auditing/monitoring all accounts.  It is possible that after due notice, we will commence with the closure of unutilized account.s.  Please call if you have any questions.  Sara    David P Dupre 06/11/2000 01:45 PM 
 Still waiting to hear from you.  Attached is a refinement of your proposal but I don't know if it accurately describes what you want.  SS 
 Please print out the "swap" documents for me ASAP.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - this may be a duplicate 
 please print from SWAP 1 to the end.  Thanks.  SS 
 Jen:  This is a good question and I think that the PG&E lawyer may be confused here with instructions to her traders. The PG&E trader can call either an ECC or ENA trader BUT a transaction will ALWAYS be booked and confirmed in the name of ENA under the executed ENA ISDA Master Agreement with PG&E.  For internal purposes, the trade will either remain on an ENA book or backed to an ECC book.  I hope this answers your question.  Sara    Jennifer Fraser 06/10/2000 04:49 PM 
 David:  Thank you for the email.  I left a message for you to call (let me know what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to make the language generic enough to include all future products which might fall into this category.  We considered the following:  Alternative 1:  "For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . ."  Alternative 2:  "For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . . "  We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. "including but not limited to paper and pulp").  Also, "newer market" may not mean illiquid. "No market" could mean that we are the only market maker.  Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a separate writing. Can we please discuss?  I am free all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara 
 We are continuing to send Deemed ISDA's to this entity (periodically) and have transacted with other Glencore entities in the past.   I would like to generate a draft ISDA and send to these guys because it will make our life easier (and we say as much in a Deemed ISDA).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gary:  I believe we are having our guaranty executed.  We haven't seen the draft of yours.  Please send ASAP.  How long will it take for you to execute?  Sara 
 Looks like our counterparty did not have authority to transact.  SS 
 Can you supply with an addressee list for potential closure of ANY futures accounts?  There are currently about seven inactive accounts for all types of commodities.  Thanks.  Sara    David P Dupre 06/12/2000 12:55 PM 
 Jaime:  When speaking with you earlier, I completely forgot to mention that Carol St. Clair (Ext. 33989) will be addressing EOL issues arising in connection with Enron Mexico Corp.  Please forgive me.  I know that Carol is trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in Mexico.  It may be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals, etc. for her to include in her discussions.  I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.  Please let me hear from you and I look forward to meeting with you later this week.  Regards.  Sara 
 Please let me know if the attached guaranty is identical to the original incoming guaranty in the other Merrill file.  We're trying to execute today or tomorrow. 
 Yes, my other question to Gary was HOW QUICKLY can you have the guaranty executed.    "Akhtar, Kasar (GED Legal-NY)" <kakhtar@exchange.ml.com> 06/12/2000 12:09 PM 
 Susan:  this guaranty came from the lawyer.  Use this instead of the earlier version.  SS 
 Jaime:  Carol and I are available on Tuesday, June 13 from 10 am - 11:45 am and after 3 pm.  Please let us hear from you (and who should initiate the call).  Thanks.  Sara    Jaime Williams@ENRON 06/12/2000 04:50 PM 
 This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between "First Method" (one-way payments) and "Second Method" (two-way payments) for Early Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was included in the "Event of Change" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the ISDA concept of "Illegality", a "Termination Event").  I think it was probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT form. 
 FYI 
 Sheetal:  Please note that ENA will ALWAYS want to include an Annex B with this Counterparty.  Legal will need to review each time.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:   (1) We need to have the following agreement with Goldman re-executed.  I have the prior agreement in my office (if you want it). Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa.  Please add this to the equity list. (2)  I will give you Direct Trading for execution.  It should also be added to the equity list. (3)  I think we need to add a reference to the First Boston Enron Corp. account to the equity list. 
 We still have outstanding issues under French law.  Netting Transactions may not be possible (i.e., may not be enforceable)  with any of the French counterparties even if you have an ISDA in place.  If netting is not a concern, then we can have separate and unrelated transactions.  Are you going to push an ISDA for SITA?   Let's discuss.  Michael will have to encourage his counterparties to respond to our French counsel; SITA never did.  Sara 
 legal/credit meeting - please verify conference room 
 We do not have any executed docs to send to Morgan Stanley to open the account.  Lauren is awaiting signatures.  Ted Murphy is the only signature required  outside the India group.  Morgan will open the account with faxed signatures.  Did Anthony ever give you an account number?  Sara 
 Lauren spoke with Anthony last night - all is calm.  Sheila will track down an account number.  Lauren will deliver docs to you today and we will need Ted's signature.  We can send out the package tonight.  One of Anthony's assistants is handling today.  By the way, Enron India LLC recieved the largest share of the IPO.  There are problems with the other the other India account. 
 Will you please contact them again.  SS    Tana Jones 06/14/2000 10:04 AM 
 We're almost ready - a few more minutes 
 forget the earlier message.  this is it 
 Bob:  Hope all is well.  Per my voice mail, attached is the confirm.  I'm trying to refresh my knowledge of equity derivatives and securities issues (for ENE).  You can reach me at 713/853-5620.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.   It's looking like a wave of equity deals is coming my way. Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  What's this about? 
 Susan:  will you please handle. Thanks.  Sara 
 Please review and let's talk.  Thanks.  SS 
 FYI 
 Paul:  I think you are trying to avoid me!  Hope all is well and you are just overworked and overwhelmed.  I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is located in London.  In connection with that group's activities, I have some questions and all fingers point to you.  (1)  Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit derivative transactions (including your online "bankruptcy swap") in the US? I am sure that you've already explored the "insurance" issue and I don't want to duplicate reasearch, if possible. (2)  What forms have you devised?  Are they online?   Should I just grab a password? (3)  Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?  Is trading in credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of derivatives?  I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in "securites" for that exam to be necessary. (4)  Where is enroncredit.com headed?  I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.  Sara

 I will be on vacation on Friday, June 30.  Sara 
 Rod:  I'm thinking ahead with respect to Enron Corp./Hickerson matters.  A few current issues include:  (1)  Nogid/Freeland seem to be entering into more equity swaps.  I have asked that copes of all equity transactions be forwarded to my attention immediately.  The first order of business includes transacting with the following parties in the following order: 1.  Credit Suisse First Boston ("CSFB").  We have an ECT ISDA with Credit Suisse Financial Products which I believe is the predecessor to CSFB.  Can you verify?  Do we need to amend or create a new master? 2.  Bear Stearns (I believe that it will be Bear Stearns International Limited because equities are done offshore) 3.  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.  (you already provided credit)  Please let me know about 1 and 2 above.  (2)  Credit derivatives and distressed loan transactions  On May 18, 2000, I provided you with a list of the types of transactions originating in Kinneman's group by ECT Investments.  Do these guys ever need to communicate with credit?  How do you monitor?  Please let me know who I should be speaking with about these transactions. 
 Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F.  and Tana an expression of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?  I was thinking that a gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift products, etc.) and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate their efforts.   Sara 
 I made some changes to the language below assuming use for an ISDA.  My onl= y=20 problem is that I am not certain that the IPE description is what we use=20 (I'll defer to your verification) but it appears each monthly calculation= =20 incorporates pricing from three different delivery month contracts.  Sara  P.S.  I would like a copy of the Platt's marketwire if you can locate 
 Don't worry - I already spoke to Souad.  SS 
 Hope all is well.  How do I get in touch with you?  Sara 
 I'll be reachable all afternoon at (713) 664-3207.  Please feel free to call me.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The market for this Transaction is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets and, accordingly, this Transaction may be subject to greater risk than other derivatives transactions.  This should be added to the confirm as: (i)  numbered paragraph 2 for the ISDA confirm (ii)  the second sentence (opening paragraph) of the omnibus 
 I guess you know that Mark was inquiring as to who had ordered these.  I'd like a copy of the Japanese materials.  thanks.  Sara 
 All:  Attached are Bob's comments.  I have not yet reviewed but will do so= =20 shortly.  We're making progress on the masters.  And it will be important t= o=20 track ALL EQUITY CONFIRMATIONS.  I would appreciate your advising me whenev= er=20 Enron Corp. transacts derivatives/forwards, whether in the name of Enron=20 Corp. or ENA, on a timely basis.

 Hi, Patricia!  Just thought I'd drop you a quick note to see what you might have available by Maxwell Hendler.  I understand that you had a recent show of his work.  Please drop me an email or you can reach me at work (713) 853-5620.  Mike and I still think about "Tangee", "Aqua Pool", etc.  I hope you are doing well and we look forward to returning to L.A. soon.  Thanks very much.  Regards.  Sara 
 per my voice mail 
 Attached are the two (2) sets of assignments with attached trade descriptions.  (1)  the first set (first two docs) is an assignment of trades between ENA and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc.  subject to the ISDA which we are now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades]  (2)  the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc.  I have no idea where this came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.  Who is verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?  Presently, the assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm will be governed by the Master] 
 Tana:  Jason still does not have access to the Financial Trading dababase. Can you facilitate please?  thanks.  Sara 
 There was a flurry of activity in March, 1997 involving Petron but it was on the physical side and we never made it to the swap issues.  Again in April, 1998, Manuel and John Enerson began looking into the issue of gaming statutes in an effort to attack legislation in the Philippines.  No further legal work was ever attempted.  Hope this helps.  Regards.   SS 
 Jim:  We are still trying to resolve the ISDA issues.  On a slightly different note, could you please send me copies of the executed confirmations for the five trades that HSES has with J. Aron?  My fax number is (713) 646-3490.  Thanks.  Sara    "Jim Piccone" <jpiccone@hsresources.com> 06/20/2000 02:41 PM

 Hi, Shari:  Carol told me that you and Peggy have some memoranda addressing the validity of local derivatives trading in Mexico.  I would appreciate copies.  Do I need to also place these in our legal opinion database? Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is Sara's Project List. 
 Jim:  I couldn't tell if you received this message.  Sara 
 Mark:  ENA is looking into derivatives trading with an Indian corporate.  My latest information is the opinion from 1/14/97 rendered by Crawford Bayley & Co. (which was part of our global survey effort a few years ago).  Do you have anything more recent?  The ENA inquiry came from the pulp and paper group.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 fyi.  also, I just spoke with Sarah Wesner (ext. 35261) who will coordinate with you.  You can review the note with her and let's talk about their guaranty (will our guaranty format work?).  Also, I'm almost inclined to go with their commitment letter (if revised) in lieu of a lengthier agreement. SS 
 Paul:  Please see below.  How serious is this inquiry as it will require some work on the legal side?  Sara 
 Andrea Bertone forwarded the recent memo about the new Brazilian Regulatory Affairs' Database.  I can access the index through Enron's intranet but I receive the message that Netscape cannot acces the address "http://ei-sp-01/regulatory" when I try to access one of the six parts of the database.  I am an ECT user (not Enron Development).  Can you help me to access the site or tell me what I need to do to view legislation, documents, etc.?  Thanks very much.  Sara 
 fyi (I've asked Sheila to add your name to the list).  Sara 
 Thanks for the heads up.  Also, please add Samantha Boyd to the list since she will be assisting us with these accounts.  Thanks.  Sara    Sheila Glover 06/22/2000 09:02 AM

 Susan:  Steve Morus called and would like for you to email to him the schedule/CSA for comment.  Info already in database.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Pushkar:  Here's the language suggested by Merrill for use in NDF's.  I am not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Looks like Rafael never read the email that Susan Flynn sent to Nancy a few days ago.  I don't know where this stands.  Sara 
 Susan and Susan:  Please let me know who will handle.  I am holding the confirm.  Sara 
 Thanks for your response.  My prior message to you was in error because I did enter the correct address.  For example, I can get to the screen that says "Documents" but when I click on one of the choices, I get a message that says "Netscape is unable to locate the server ei-sp-data01.  Please check the server name and try again."  Am I doing something wrong?  Should I simply call the Helpdesk here in Houston?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please let me review final changes.  Sara 
 Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Joe:  Attached in draft form is a transaction that Chris Foster may do with Arco today.  His number in Portland is 834-3822.  I'm not certain about credit and "ECT" will have to change to "ENA".  Let's keep in touch. Thanks.  Sara 
 Jarrod:  attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp omnibus confirms (and Bob has reviewed this language):   Also, attached is the Temple-Inland confirm and I have changed only the "Credit or Other Special Provisions" paragraph.  You will have to attach Exhibit "A" (which Susan sent you last week).    P.S.  Please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty.  I believe that Paul told me by Wednesday. 
 Tana:  Please see that Jeff Nogid and Clint Freeland are given access to our Financial Trading Agreements database.  Thanks.  Sara

 Susan:  Steve Morus called again and asked that you please email the Schedule/CSA for comment.  Thanks.  Sara 
 attached are comments (and note that you do not need the defined term "Agreement" in the opening paragraph:    I do not understand your "Notice of Exercise" because it describes an option to extend.  Please call. 
 Please let me know if you think that this works for Canada.  Sara 
 You are most welcome.  Hope the food is as good as the OTHER get together.  SS    Suzanne Adams 06/26/2000 03:43 PM 
 When will you have some time to discuss (a)  templates and (b) short dated trades? 
 Kevin:  We are holding up the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement until you finalize your piece.  The DATE of the earliest trade between ENA and HS Resources is important because we will use that date for the ISDA.  Please verify that date as soon as possible.  Thanks.  Sara    Kevin Meredith@ENRON 06/26/2000 03:32 PM 
 Susan:  Which Paribas are you referring to?    Susan Flynn 06/26/2000 04:50 PM 
 please call.  I'd like copy of final Media General.  Also, we need to discuss the notice.  sara 
 Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.  From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third party.  Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot solicit the party to enter into the transaction.  If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or sell by the counterparty.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara [ENA legal] 
 John:  Please call me when you have had a chance to review.  Sara 
 Susan:  have you heard anything?  Also, before I forget, please document the account in London with CSFB that we used to receive money in connection with metals trading. 
 All:  Attached is a short recap of the items which I have been discussing with Clint and Jeff.  I'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow.  Rex and Jim:  I will fax to you copies of the Enron Corp. resolutions (some final, some draft only) referenced in the attached summary.  I may not have the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet. Please call me with a suggested time.  This afternoon is best for me. 
 fyi 
 Trena:  In the next week or so, I will be devoting most of my time and attention to Gary's world.  I met with Gary last week, and he suggested that I give you a call to see if you needed any legal assistance.  I am available for whatever you might need me for.  My number in Houston is 713/853-5620. I'm looking forward to working with you.  Regards.  Sara 
 please print - and - can you remind me what I need to do in order to print spreadsheets?  thanks 
 Tana:  I hope I'm not repeating myself here but Laurel Adams (confirm desk - Hickerson) and Sheila Glover (Hickerson CFO) need access.  If it's been provided already, my apologies for asking again.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Patrick,  Sara is not available at all today for a conference call.  Paul Radous will be on the conference call instead of Rod Nelson.  Are you and Julian available tomorrow at 11:30 am Buenos Aires time, 9:30 am Houston time. Please respond to Kaye.Ellis@enron.com.  Thank you,  Kaye    Patrick Hansen@ENRON 06/28/2000 12:53 PM 
 At last!  Thursday morning at 10:30 am, Rex Rogers and Jim Armogida will meet with me in my office.  You are invited.  I suspect that much of our conversation will be a repeat of the meeting that you had last week.  Sara 
 Rod and I discussed this party (which always appears on the legal/credit list!!!!  It seem that BP signed a Master Agreement (our OLD form) with ECTRIC on 1/8/98 and agreed to sign THE IDENTICAL AGREEMENT with ENA.  Absent an executed agreement, ENA and BP continue to use a form of "Swap Contract" which had been agreed to many years ago (similar to our GTC's in the omnibus) which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement.   Rod doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a high priority.  Having said all of this, the form is limited to swaps, doesn't provide for setoff, arbitration, certain market disruption events and several other items which we can review if necessary.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please advise.  Sara 
 Carson:  I have been pretty awful, haven't I?  I took a short vacation to Dallas last Friday but I'm back now.  I'd love to have lunch one day.  Just give me a call (713/853-5620) and we can catch up.  Not much news; same old, same old.  Sara    "R. Carson Llewellyn" <carlew@flash.net> 06/30/2000 01:36 PM 
 RE:  Deal Nos.  EY 6926 EY 8108 EY 8531 EY 9343 EQ 6930.1, .2  ECT does NOT have a master with The Dow Chemical Company.  Are these trades booked on an omnibus?  I am not certain that credit approved these trades. Are they all propane?  We need to discuss.  SS 
 We are currently in negotiations with them.  Please do not forward my emails to Bank One.  Sara    David P Dupre 06/30/2000 10:51 AM

 Mary:  Attached is a format that I used in 1999 to inquire about certain issues impacting financial trading with foreign counterparties.  I also have information about possible New Guinea counsel which I will clear with Derrick and Haedicke.  Our potential trading counterparty is a mining company called "OK Tedi".  Sara

 Tana:  You offered to send the TXU agreement for multiple confirms.  Thanks. Sara 
 James:  I just thought I'd follow up with you regarding our conversation of June 7, 2000.  I thought that you were going to produce a new draft based upon our discussion.  Please let me know if I misunderstood or if in fact the ball is in my court.  Thanks.  Sara 
 James:  Please ignore my earlier email.  I do have your email of 6/13/00 and will respond as quickly as possible.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Susan:  Which Paribas are you referring to? 
 FYI.  Let's talk later.   SS 
 All:  It appears that this is the group which can best address the (derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.  We have all undertaken to provide the group with the following items:  (1)  "Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity Derivatives" Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.  Comments are invited.  (2)  The transacting party:  ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron Corp.? Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate trading in ENA.  I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.  (3)  Enron Corp. equity trading resolution Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.  This will be necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will want to review      (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires authorization.  (4)  Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.  This can be used as our "form" for future transactions.  (5)  Enron Corp. "position paper" addressing equity derivative parameters, preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc. I have no volunteers.  Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.  As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.  Please let me know if we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on behalf of Enron Corp.).  I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. 
 Where does this stand?  Have you received the guaranty from Clem? 
 All:  I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, he is entirely neutral.  However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron Corp. to transact on its own stock.  I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining potential targets in the name of "Enron Corp." without Credit Support Annexes.  Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).  The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.  These are "Deemed ISDA's" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the parties do represent that they have such authority).  Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp. Thanks.  Sara 
 Has Mark spoken with you yet about Latin America?  Let's talk!  Sara 
 Susan:  Please forward your two emails (re:  HS Resources,et al) to Bill Bradford and John Suttle.  SS    Susan Flynn 07/06/2000 07:35 PM 
 Joel:  Are you also going to send out the ABN Amro guaranty?  We're sending the draft credit agreement.  Sara 
 Joel:  thanks - everything was sent out as draft as we don't have all internal comments (and we don't even know ABN's position!).  Sara    Joel Ephross@ENRON 07/07/2000 08:22 PM 
 FYI 
 All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc.  The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of "The Dow Chemical Company".  Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved the changes.  Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.  SS

 Dear Dan:  Sorry not to send the check last week as promised.  It seems that my mom landed in a hospital in England and I had to dash out of town.  Now, eight days later, I am just catching up.  Tomorrow (July 19) I will send the check to you by Federal Express for Friday delivery together with my request for a response from you to the "birthday boy".  I did receive your newsletter - thanks very much.  Regards.  Sara 
 Trena:  We have ISDA agreements as follows:  (1)  CIBC (a)  Enron Corp. has a 1/17/96 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act through offices in Tokyo, London and New York.  If this agreement is used, we need to add FX/currency provisions. (b)  ENA has a 10/1/94 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act through offices in Toronto, Tokyo and London.  The agreement was amended on 5/24/96 (to add a collateral annex), on 7/27/97 t(o add FX/currency option and FRABBA provisions) and on 1/13/00 (to amend thresholds).  (2)  Deutsche Bank AG ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We are speaking with Stephen Kessler (legal) in New York.  (3)  Commerzbank AG ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We sent a draft ISDA to Terence Zahner in New York on 10/6/99.  This was suppose to be forwarded to lawyers in Germany.  We left a message for someone named Roger Ackerman in NY in March, 2000.  (4)  Metall Bank - NOTHING   Please let me know if you need anything further.  Sara    Trena McFarland 07/18/2000 09:58 AM

 The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I believe is your Dow trader.  Mike is trying to trade financially under the name "The Dow Chemical Company".   ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY WITH "DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC" (the party that ECT has a Master Agreement with).  ECT will NOT agree to change the counterparty on any future trades.  When you speak with Mike Billings, you may alert him to this. Thanks.  Sara

 Mary:  We deleted this counterparty from the legal/credit list yesterday. Since commercial is not pushing, we determined that it would be imprudent to hire outside counsel at this time.  Sara 
 Per my earlier email and the one below, could you please let us know about the 2000 Defintions?  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Carol:  Peter del Vecchio is looking for Canadian counsel in connection with a paper acquisition and inquired about Stikeman.  Have you worked with any of their lawyers (perhaps on the Canadian cash collateralization issue)? 
 Can you please print the attached and next message with the correct margins and then label a manila file as "Accounting:  Issue Nos 96-13, 00-19 and 00-7". 
 Would you please generate a fresh ENE guaranty and email to the lawyer (see Lotus Notes - Emma Nakakuki is the new attorney).  Also, please verify with credit (Rod Nelson in London) that the guaranty cap has not changed.  I have the file in my office.  Thanks.  SS 
 Here's the info for documentation.  Please call.  Sara 
 Please print the email and attachment (click "view").  I need to learn how to handle margins when printing.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please enter into Lotus Notes so that we can track. 
 Peter:  check with Shari Stack.  Sara 
 Let's talk.  Sara 
 I received a call again from Gary Ordway.  Who will be preparing credit? Gary asked that his credit person be copied and his name is John Fryer. Thanks.  Sara 
 Bob:  I am having a stack of materials relating to Enron Corp. equity trading sent to your attention via Federal Express on Monday.   DO NOT READ ANYTHING YOU RECEIVE.  Rex, Jim and I have been discussing the variety of Enron Corp. equity derivatives on ENE stock, the latest accounting issuances, ENE Board resolutions, confirmation templates and the like.  Rex should be contacting you shortly to schedule a conference call.  The package of materials MIGHT be useful when we discuss the foregoing issues (or, it might be totally useless!).  Hope you have a great weekend.  Regards.  Sara 
 Have you had a chance to review Dale's product description?  Please let's discuss.  Sara 
 Ben Bedell, the lawyer for BT, has called to about the calculations I forwarded to you on Wednesday.  Are we agreed?  Please let me know asap.  I know that the parties wanted to close today. Sara 
 Hi, Clem!  Please see below message from Sheila Glover.  I believe that in the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.  I'll be speaking with Paul Radous in credit.  Do you see any issues here?  Sara 
 Is the question for online and offline products (to the extent that we gear up for metals online)?    Noel Petterson@ENRON 07/31/2000 08:05 AM 
 I am advised by the EI help desk in Houston that I must obtain EI security clearance before I can be granted access to this database.  Are you able to assist me by sending a message to EI security?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tana:  per my voice mail re:  EOL. 
 The ETA provides that a master agreement will control (over GTC's) if a master agreement has been executed by the parties.  Sara    Noel Petterson@ENRON 07/31/2000 08:28 AM 
 Elizabeth:  You can remove my name (and Kaye Ellis's name) from the list. Brent Hendry will handle Latin America financial trading for now.  Thanks. Sara    Elizabeth Serralheiro@ENRON 07/31/2000 09:00 AM 
 Mary:  Just a reminder.  Tana is not in charge of form changes; Susan Bailey handles that function.  Tana's primary role is "special projects" but she is helping Susan and Samantha with daily matters until Stephanie begins work and has some experience.  Sara    Mary Cook 07/31/2000 10:43 AM 
 Attached is the latest listing.  Please send comments and corrections. 
 Laurel:  I need to verify the Enron party (specifically).  I am reviewing the format.  Thanks.  Sara    Laurel Adams 07/31/2000 05:03 PM 
 Rod:  FYI, Paul's doing bond swap with UBS.  Does credit have any issues?  I am verifying the Enron party (since I am not familiar with the ECT Investment Trust).  Please advise.  Sara 
 Bob:  Did you ever speak with Justin Boyd in our London office (as suggested by Paul Simons) about the MG traders or what Justin can tell us about the acquisition?   Sara 
 Pizzolato (a director in the debt portfolio group)    Rod Nelson 08/01/2000 02:18 AM 
 Edmund:  could you please identify the Morgan entity you are referencing? Sara 
 I don't know anything about this.  Sara    Tana Jones 08/01/2000 01:14 PM 
 Paul:  Jason sent the following issues to me but Nos. 1,2 and 4 impact credit.  Please call me to discuss.  Sara 
 Hi, Jason!  Please send me your phone and fax.  Do you still have voice mail over here?  Regarding your message, I have asked Paul to consider items 1,2 and 4 since each bears upon credit.  I'll get back to you. On a different note, how would you like some more work?  Call when you're free.  Sara    "JASON PETERS" <PETEJ@andrews-kurth.com> 08/01/2000 08:16 PM 
 Ted:  I never received the updated list mentioned in our Monday meeting. Could you please email one to me?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Mark:  Russell Diamond in credit said that you took a call from the WPS lawyer about 10 days ago.  You entered the call into Lotus Notes. (1)  What was the conversation about? (2)  Did you assign this file to anyone?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.  (1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held in a U.S. account).  (2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter" being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this project in your absence?  Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's all the news for now.  Talk to you soon.  Sara  P.S.  Can you send photos over the net? 
 Clint:  after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will be drafted for the Oct. meeting.  In the interim, he is convinced that only Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.  I am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our approach.  This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear (from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board meeting.  Sara 
 I need your expertise.  Attached is only a start.  SS 
 Mary:  Please let me know what happens.  All calculations should be made as of a specific date.  Sara    Mary Cook 08/02/2000 01:12 PM 
 Cathy and I left a message for Per since he originates hedge funds.  SS    Tana Jones 08/04/2000 09:16 AM 
 Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical activity in that product), I have the following question:  If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?  I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.  I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620] 
 Attached are sample templates for ISDA confirms which you requested.  The swap (first template) includes sample NG Floating Price language.  Sara 
 I will need to be at my home today and tomorrow at 4 pm for repair estimates.  I will coordinate my schedule with Kaye.  Sara 
 Received copy of deal ticket.  What's going on?  Sara 
 Mark:  Do we have any special considerations/expertise with respect to the evaluation of "internet trading platform" agreements?  I am starting to see more of these from Gary's group.  Please let me know.  Currently, I have Jason evaluating two of these.  Sara 
 Mary:  I hear through the grapevine that we may be trading through Bank One. In any event, we need to add all of the executed agreements to the Lotus Notes database.  Samantha should be able to handle this for you since she maintains and updates the brokerage reports and keeps the files near her desk.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Edmund:  Did you draft the DTD language?  I have questions.  Also, I would= =20 kindly appreciate your response on Morgan Stanley.  Thanks.  Sara 
 The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm. If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Sara    Tana Jones 08/07/2000 10:52 AM 
 I don't have a 7/28/00 email from you.  What do you need? SS    Samantha Boyd@ENRON 08/07/2000 03:29 PM

 Who will be handling P&G this 'go-round?  Sara 
 Susan:  I need to see if we ever incorporated any P&G comments into any prior draft.  Then we should redraft a new master (but let's speak with Ed first). Thanks.  Sara 
 Edmund:  Attached is a slightly different version of DTD Brent which I have= =20 drafted.  I would like to discuss.  Please let me know when you can talk. = =20 Sara 
 You bet!  It's me.  I've been at Enron since mid-1994.  Sara    egflegal 08/08/2000 09:33 AM 
 Jeff says Floating Price language is ok.  SS 
 The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South Africa regarding FX clearances.  It seems that prior to transacting with a South African party, we need copies of the party's "certification" from the National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby converting local currency to USD).  Such approvals are severely restricted. I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our "database" of global advice.  Sara 
 Sheila:  I just received the package from Simmons.  Will you please send your request to the usual suspects?  Thanks.  Sam:  Will you please track this agreement on Lotus Notes?  Thanks. 
 Yes.  Sara  P.S.  Can you call me and let me know what products you are looking to trade online.    Mike Fowler@ENRON 08/08/2000 12:43 PM 
 Kevin:  Attached is a draft form of confirm.  There are many details to be completed but this is a start.  Sara 
 I hope this is really for you!  Sara 
 ...and here's the rest...  Could you please handle? 
 John:  Did you speak with John Nicholson?  I need his phone number please. Call me.  Sara 
 Ken:  Where can I find the CFTC's statement that the swap policy statement is not available for agricultural trade options?  We are in a "holding pattern" for the time being.  No products have been developed.  Thanks.  Sara    RAISLERK@sullcrom.com 08/04/2000 11:41 AM 
 ENA is waiting for a blackline from Harvard's outside lawyer which should incorporate all previous discussions.  Until that time, we cannot be certain that Harvard has incorporated all of our comments and concessions.  Sara  Per:  Do you want to have a conference call with all of us? 
 Mary:  Mieco is one of Carol's "Top Tens".  Would you please take this one? Ed Sacks will be calling you shortly.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - here's the info I just received from the "ECT trader" in Buenos Aires!!!!!!!! 
 Friday is best for me.  I think you should have John S. available.  I'll make sure that Jason is available by phone.  SS    Per Sekse 08/09/2000 12:14 PM 
 Tina:  Per my voice mail, please provide me with a copy of the confirm of the referenced transaction booked by J. Aron in the name of ENA rather than Enron Corp., expiring 12/08/00, settling 12/11/00 (collar, Strike 1.55).  Who is monitoring?  ENA (and Enron Corp.) are being asked to execute this novation. Thanks.  Sara 
 Libby Rutherford  - legal Irene Yates - tax    Ed Quinn 08/09/2000 02:58 PM 
 FYI - is Tina right? 
 Brent:  In connection with the "research memoranda" which I gave to you, the specific issue about whether ENA can hold cash collateral posted by a Canadian party has arisen in connection with a company named J.D. Irving, Limited.  ENA legal has spoken with Peter Keohane, two Canadian law firms and one US law firm, and previously concluded that it was easier to simply not accept cash.  Please see what you can do!  Thanks.  Sara 
 I don't know this S&C lawyer! 
 FYI 
 Brent and Ed:  I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you both to each other (if you haven't already met!).  Ed:  Brent is handling Latin America.  Brent:  Ed is part of our pulp & paper commercial group.  Can you please respond to his inquiry?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  Will you please print this out for me?  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI as we sort through this structure. 
 You're FAST!    Brent Hendry@ENRON 08/10/2000 04:59 PM 
 Done.  Thanks.  Sara    Mary Cook 08/10/2000 03:30 PM 
 Jason:  Two more electronic agreements. Samantha:  Please enter into database. 
 David:  Attached is the confirm Sara mentioned to you.  Below is a note for you from her:  1.  Price Return Swap 2.  Single payment of interest upon Final Termination  May need to convert to a TRS.  Will call.    Kaye 
 Justin/Paul:  The Houston contingent of EnronCredit.com Limited has a number of agreements which they would like to have executed.  All ENA/Enron Corp. affiliate brokerage/futures agreements are signed by the Enron trading party TOGETHER WITH Ted Murphy (for control purposes).  I am currently reviewing about 4-6 of these agreements.  How should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from Houston?  Shall I continue to review? Do you have trading resoutions/authorized trader lists in place for EnronCredit.com Limited?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 Sheila:  Mike Fowler is involved in this effort.  He tells me that the entity is "EnronCredit.com Limited".  Is this info correct?  Sara    Sheila Glover 08/11/2000 10:44 AM 
 Did you have comments on the bullet points?  Sara 
 I've been working with our desk to create draft confirm which Brent received yesterday.  Should I be dealing with Julian?  SS 
 Mary:  After our last credit meeting, Russell's idea of "following up" on this counterparty was to assign it to Ed Sacks!  Can you please work with Ed?  This is one of Carol's files.  Once negotiated, it will serve as the basis for Reliant Energy Services Canada Ltd.  Thanks.  Sara 
 please print on legal 
 Kaye:  Please remind me on Monday of this "delivery". Thanks.  Hope you had a great weekend.  Sara 
 Mark:  I am totally confused.  WHO is addressing CFTC issues for MG London, Inc.?  What is Alan's involvement?  SS 
 Good morning David! Just hoping that you could have the confirm sent this morning.  I need to review with the commercial guys.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Please review the attached letter and comment.  I'll be glad to sign or would you prefer?  Sara 
 Edmund:  Did you ever have a chance to run my language by your trader?  Sar= a 
 Molly:  I left you a voice mail this morning about Citibank.  The file reflects that you received correspondence from Citibank on 2/22/00 and Carol St. Clair had propsed revisions to the existing 1/9/96 ISDA Master Agreement (including changes to the CSA).  Have you agreed to those changes?  The Australia office is inquiring about the status of this Master Agreement. Thanks.  Sara 
 I am not aware of the nuances of copper trading!  However, I left a message earlier this morning to find out from the MG lawyer.  I haven't heard back. The deal ticket should provide for the premium payment date and, if not, I would use our standard language.  Sara    Souad Mahmassani 08/14/2000 09:38 AM 
 here it is 
 Molly:  I'll send to you the latest draft.  Shane is looking to do a rate swap and that is fine without FX amendments!  But, shouldn't we verify whether our business will include FX (or did you already confirm)?  Thanks. Sara    Molly Harris 08/14/2000 02:21 PM 
 All:  I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with respect to MG London, Inc. from a U.S. regulatory perspective and WHO is addressing them.  My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.  I will try to have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course of action, etc.  I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can include them as necessary.  Thanks.  Sara 
 When you have execution copies ready, have Kaye type on letter for me to sign.  Thanks.  SS 
 David:  I'm  just reviewing your fax and although your recap of the floating rate calculation was correct on the phone, there is no language in the confirm.  Were you going to respond to this as well?  (interest rate to apply to reduced notional, etc.) 
 All:  (1)  Please provide the name of the Enron party to this agreement.  If it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.  I never heard back from Paul Simons. (2)  What is the priority?  I think we are waiting to hear back from Mike because we have had a conversation with the BuySideDirect people and can give an additional explanation.  Sara 
 All:  Attached are the following docs: (1)  Talon I LLC/Harrier I LLC equity swap confirm (2)  Harrier I LLC/EBS Investments, L.L.C. equity swap confirm (3)  revised ISDA Master Agreement Schedule for Harrier I LLC and EBS Investments, L.L.C.  Please review and provide me with your comments.  I do not have all necessary address and account information. The swaps are subject to the  ISDA 1996 Equity Derivatives Definitions. Section 7.4 (of those Definitions) contains the payment obligations and provides that the Equity Amount Payer pays a positive Equity Amount and "the other party" pays the absolute value of a negative Equity Amount.  Also, I believe that Accounting Issue 00-19 is inapplicable to this Total Return Swap or else we may have issues with the "Extraordinary Events" elections. Sara 
 Kaye:  Please print out the 3 docs for me.  Thanks.  SS 
 Brent is looking into this issue. 
 what tab?    Taffy Milligan 08/14/2000 02:18 PM 
 Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's "regulated" product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) choose to become a regulated "ATOM" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal perspective, I think we should have a "whitepaper" drafted by Sullivan & Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out who's on first (with MG).  Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.  See you later.  Sara 
 FYI 
 I'll review the guaranty after lunch.  Have we sent our comments back?  Lisa just did a 5-year deal with Xerox!!!!!!!!!  ss 
 The interest component was eliminated from the terms of this Transaction (as was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name change).  It seems that Ben and Scott S. had a subsequent conversation (after ours) and the agreed changes were communicated to me.  SS    Kevin Garland@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 08/15/2000 01:20 PM 
 I need someone assigned to assist in amending this agreement.  Most of the work is done.  Please let me know ASAP. 
 Jason:  Before we designate specific individuals, let's think this through. A "generic" address may be more appropriate.  Which agreement did we recently sign with reference to the "Documentation Desk"?  Sara 
 FYI 
 Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.  We need to update agreements, status, etc.  Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus Notes.  Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and provide a copy for me.  Let's take about an hour.  Thanks.  Sara  ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along! 
 pls print docs 
 You already knew this was ok with me I hope.    Taffy Milligan 08/16/2000 09:45 AM 
 Shane:  Here's the scoop  (1)  ENA has an existing ISDA Master Agreement with Citibank N.A.. dated as of November 17, 1992.  The Master is not restricted to any particular type of transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.  ENA is the Calculation Agent.  Also, only commodity transactions are netted.  (2)  Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.  The amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities. It also states Citibank to be "multibranch" with NY and London offices acting under the Master.  Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).  Mollie Harris in credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.  (3)  ABN Amro is in my office ready for signature.  I will have it executed and email you when done.  Samantha Boyd (Ext.39188) will help me with the followup.  Please let me know if you have any questions.      Shane Dallmann@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/14/2000 10:15 PM 
 FYI 
 Kaye:  Please schedule Sam for an hour on Friday.  Also, when avoidable, I'd prefer not to meet at 1 pm because people are always late.  Thanks.  sara 
 All:  I have once again revised the confirm for the EBS Raptor deal.  There will be only one swap transaction:  Harrier I LLC/Talon I LLC. Please note the following changes:  (1)  the Initial Equity Notional Amount has been corrected (2)  I have expanded the definition of Cash Dividends (3)  I have ADDED a provison for "Payment Obligations" to avoid confusion for those of you unfamiliar with the 1996 Equity Definitions.  Since I have removed the interest payment feature, the only payments changing hands will be upside/dividends and downside.  The "Equity Amount Payer" pays the upside (difference between Initial Price (on the relevant Valuation Date) and Final Price) and dividends; the other party pays the downside. (4)  I have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates. (5) Kevin:  I NEED the Harrier account/notice information.  This confirm should serve as a template for additional Raptor equity share swaps so please review and comment.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Darren:  Laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending brokerage/futures agreements.  Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an effort to avoid confusion.  Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading resolutions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 I am receiving calls from Gina Karathanos in Global Finance about this deal. She's inquiring about preparation of certificates, authorizations and signers.  Susan, please coordinate with Mary on that end (I presume we follow the same format as Carol).  As far as I know, closing is scheduled for Aug. 24.  Apparently, lots of ENE officers will be out of town next week.  Do we know who will sign for ENA?  Thanks.  SS 
 Will focus later today. How are we handling ABN Amro?  I want to have executed.  Were you going to revise the notice page and add the location on the trading floor in the other agreement (?).  Please talk to Sam.  The docs are in my office.  I have meetings all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara    "JASON PETERS" <PETEJ@andrews-kurth.com> 08/17/2000 09:53 AM 
 Kaye:  re:  my vm about John Stoner in California, BEWARE as I may have this meeting (which is more important)!!!!!!!!!!!  Maybe Stoner can be at the end of the day here. 
 We are still waiting to hear from you about the confirm.  Please call or e-mail.  SS 
 Is John also responsible for brokerage/futures?  Will he run through Ted? Will we keep copies? 
 Sami:  Congratulations!!!!!!!!   She's adorable.  Sara    Sami Arap@ENRON 08/17/2000 03:08 PM 
 Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments:  (1)  I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap. Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).  I met with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price return only:  the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.  PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN  (2)  With respect to the right of "multiple optional partial swap terminations", please verify that: (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple requests) to be documented? (b)  the "Initial Price" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price on the date of each partial termination) 
 Sara:  I  heard rumors today about the move next week so I called Joya.  We need to pack up your office by 5 pm next Thurs. (8/24).  I'll order the boxes.  Kaye 
 Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?  (2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tana:  Have you responded to either Greg or Molly?  Please call.  Sara 
 Mark:  Do you want to speak with the Bank of Montreal about an ISDA with Japan?  Darren has been sending calls to me re:  ISDA's and brokerage agreements for our Japanese affiliate.  Sara 
 Re:  Bank of Montreal and ENA, have we terminated the CES agreement (and has credit agreed)?  I don't know how Susan F. "inactivated" the CES ISDA with BOM,  We are in the process of negotiating with BOM in connection with our Japanese affiliate.  Sara 
 How are we handling the "dual agreement" situation?  Have we spoken with credit?    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 08/21/2000 09:09 AM 
 There is no message here.  Sara 
 I returned your call about 10 minutes ago.  Sara 
 Mike:  We have sent our comments.  We do not need anything from you yet. Thanks.  Sara    Mike Fowler@ENRON 08/21/2000 09:46 AM 
 Tana:  I don't know who Brad Diebner is.  However, Greg called me.  What Greg really needs is the ENA "form" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election). He will also need a "generic" Paragraph 13.  The boilerplate can be mailed. Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later today.  Thanks.  Sara    Tana Jones 08/21/2000 09:14 AM 
 Jason:  I left a vm for Clement.  Keep your fingers crossed.  SS 
 Here they are. 
 All:  Please review for content.  This deal has been recast as a "Price Return Swap" and I hope it is self-explanatory (i.e., you won't have to drag out the 1996 Equity Definitions).  I will forward a draft letter shortly. 
 FYI 
 The swap group has a meeting every other Tuesday, including Aug. 22.  Either Mary or I will try to attend.    Carolyn George@ENRON 08/21/2000 03:03 PM 
 All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.  Will someone in credit approve this transfer?  Please let Stephanie Panus (X53249), our newest paralegal, know.  Thanks.  Sara

 for "Cash Settlement Amount":  If for any Determination Period, the Floating Price is less than or equal to the Strike Price, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Notional Quantity per Determination Period multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Strike Price over the Floating Price, which amount shall be due and payable by the Seller on the applicable Payment Date for such Determination Period.  P.S.  Melissa:  In the future, send me the deal ticket for review. 
 I just received this from Stoner.  Tanya:  I haven't reviewed this agreement, but my guess is that it may change some of the additional definitions contained in our March draft.  Sara 
 Please remember that MELISSA MURPHY (X31886) handles ALL financial power confirmations.  Any financial power confirm questions should be directed to Melissa.  Joe Hunter's group does NOT prepare financial power confirms except in extrememly limited cases (i.e., NYMEX based trades).  If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Brent:  Just a reminder, we track all trading agreements in our Lotus Notes database (you can enter negotiating issues, etc.).  Samantha oversees this part of the database, updates Ted Murphy and has the agreements executed and filed.  All trading agreements are signed by Ted and the business unit VP. Please keep Samanthat in the loop.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Why don't we talk about this.  I have initiated Samantha as the trading agreement guru.  That's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these agreements (amendments included).  Let's distinguish margin lines from trading agreements (although the margin line concept obviously includes a futures or other arrangement)  I maintain a list ("in the pipeline") which I circulate to the Hickerson desk since that desk opens the greatest number of trading agreements.

I (on the other hand) do not take a vacation until October and I hope to live.  Maybe you and Donna want to come over one night and raid my wine cellar.  That would be fun for a change.

 Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?). Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request.. Thanks.  Sara  Greg:  I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately. 
 Stephanie:  Please send the boilerplate ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex to Gregg Penman in our Chicago office.  Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:  Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited Credit Agricole Indosuez CSFB International Lehman Brother Finance S.A. Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Deutsche Bank  These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.  Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Call me when you have a chance 
 Is Mark sending you these or are you on a direct mail? 
 Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a new level.  I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor deals.  As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of termination is a potential issue.  Sara

 Attached is my response.  Sara 
 John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM (through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to ENA's agreement).  Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 Robert:  The executed "Representative Agreement" was executed by  both ENA and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July 6, 2000.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Sara    Robert McGrory@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/28/2000 12:32 AM

 I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit derivatives?  FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

 All:  Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.  On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.  We have sent comments to the first two. Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low priority). ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not heard back.  We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc. Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited.. If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!) Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).  Also, you should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.  My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.  Please let me know your comments or questions.  Thanks.  Sara

 Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.  Credit has given the O.K. to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company. We will document trades on the "omnibus" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an ISDA with the counterparty.  Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from "Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc." to the parent company.  We waste too much time and energy.  Call if you have questions.  Sara 
 Just let Mr. De Dalmas know that I asked someone to respond.  SS 
 The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters. The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March 16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager "...to develop and provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading (ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to form."  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions (by Merced's traders). Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying resolution. Sara     Christian Yoder 09/01/2000 11:22 AM 
 Russell:  Thanks for the info.  I do need to send a REMINDER to the credit group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, etc.) entering into financial trades.

Sara  P.S.  the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.

They are:  (1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A.  I did not see your response.  (2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your response.  (3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both parties agreed as to existing transactions?  Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 John:  I hear that you are trying to trade in the name of Enron North America Corp. while you sit in London.  Althought both ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp. have agreements with Instinet Corporation, those companies are all U.S. companies without any presence in the U.K. (those companies do not pay U.K. taxes!)

 Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.  There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named "SITA", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.  Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.  Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.  You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

 Are any of these yours?  What's the status?  We need to respond.  SS 
 Mark:  Your name was provided to me by John Greene who is temporarily residing in Enron's U.K. office.  I am a lawyer in the Enron North America Corp. legal department. I need to speak with someone regarding the London Instinet installation. Two different Enron  companies (both U.S. corporations) already have Instinet agreements.  They are Enron North America Corp. and ECT Investments, Inc. The London installation would presumably be in the name of a DIFFERENT entity.  I need to understand in WHAT NAME the installation will proceed. Please help to fill in the details ASAP.  My number in Houston is 713-853-5620.  I am this moment contacting David Terrace in London as I understand he handles all documentation.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 as promised 
 I will not be in the office tomorrow.  Please contact me today if we need to discuss anything.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Laurel:  I am requesting an Enron Corp. guaranty (capped at US$20 million) for ECT Investments, Inc.  I think we can sign the outstanding confirmation. Sara 
 You were going to send me a copy of the Marlin confirm - Thanks.  Sara 
 Paul:  I have several online trading agreements to be negotiated.  Are you still reviewing credit issues?  Sara 
 Of course I did!  Thanks.  Sara    Julia H Chin@ENRON 09/13/2000 02:14 PM 
 I am on vacation during the week of Oct. 9.  Sara    Brent Hendry@ENRON 09/13/2000 04:28 PM 
 Tax has confirmed that the MG deals should be confirmed in the name of RMT (and NOT ENA).  I will have an RMT/MG Ltd. ISDA master put in place.  Joe: (1)   Please confirm the exact name of the MG entity. (2)  Please confirm that the first trade date was [6/16/00].  Susan:  Please start the process for a  new ISDA Master to be effective [6/16/00]. 
 I only know what Dale told me.  I have no idea who else is involved.  SS 
 I was in the midst of sending this 
 Gary:  Thanks for the redraft.  Would you please send the swap termination format for the Transaction so that I can review it together with the Transaction confirm?  Thanks.  Sara    "Rosenblum, Gary(CICG-GEDNY)" <grosenbl@exchange.ml.com> 09/14/2000 03:37 PM 
 Tana:  I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't forgotten to request the ENE guaranty on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc. in the amount of USD20 million.  There is no Master yet but we are hopeful that this will be negotiated after the ENA Master.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tana:  attached are the L/C provisions for the Deutsche Bank Master.  Would you please verify that the provisions are in fact our language?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gary:  The swap format is fine EXCEPT that the Floating Rate should be "6.62625%" rather than the rounded "6.63%".  Thanks.  Sara    "Rosenblum, Gary(CICG-GEDNY)" <grosenbl@exchange.ml.com> 09/14/2000 03:37 PM 
 Jean:  per our conversation, attached is a draft template.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Why are you referring to "futures contracts" for the equities?  I thought that the only futures were equity index contracts. 
 Hi, Susan!  I work with the FX/rate desk and Darren Delage is currently residing in Tokyo and trading.  I have a conversation this evening with Alan Aronowitz, John Viverito and Darren to discuss Japan issues.  At the moment, Darren has exeacuted several trades.  These are being documented in Houston AS ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. trades.  I had assumed that all trades would be done in the name of the Japanese financial trading entity; I have no idea who is handling back office functions.  Can you update me?  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  We MUST confirm all trades. 
 ASAP - what's going on?  SS 
 Bob:  Don't forget!  I have several confirms with power counterparties that I need you to negotiate.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements (for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the entities listed below, we need to include "Merrill Lynch International" ("MLI").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.  Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?  All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either begin the ISDA process or change "ENA" to Enron Corp. on those agreements which have previously been sent.  Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Please print the original message and all of the attachments.  Thanks.  SS 
 Jason:  All I could find was a message from "Aaron" (in JUNE, 2000!) and the number was 212-409-0812.  The only phone number that Sheila's group has is for Erin of Lou DeSimone, both of whom are printed on the fax cover sheet which I believe you have.  Just keep a record of who you contact.  Thanks. Sara 
 Tana:  Can Jason gain access to the database for the purpose of entering/reviewing comments?  Sara 
 have we ever agreed to this (charge interest for different Payment Dates) for early payments (i.e., earlier than our usual 5 days after the Floating Price is determinable)?  SS 
 Sheila:  This party has rejected absolutely all of our comments.  We were only told of this the other day when we called to inquire.  Can you contact someone on the commercial side for help?  Sara 
 I would prefer to attach a "delivery schedule" and should have details shortly.  Thanks.  Sara 
 For purposes of Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex, the term "Valuation Date" shall mean any Friday during the Term of this Transaction or the following Business Day if such day is not a Business Day. 
 Attached are the three draft confirms:    Please let me know if we can send.  Sara 
 are you handling? 
 yes, you can call Laurel for details.    Samantha Boyd@ENRON 09/19/2000 03:03 PM 
 You haven't forgotten about the credit worksheet?  SS

 Bob:  attached is Melissa's update.  She cannot meet this afternoon but we can grab her in the morning.  Are you flexible in the a.m.?  SS 
 Greg:  Attached are the Canada documents. 
 Laurel:  Please update me on your discussion with Jean Naughton-Carr.  Sara 
 Thanks for looking over my shoulder!  Sara 
 All:  I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.  Who will be handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?  I am told that this is a Q3 deal.  Thanks.  Sara  Molly:  I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master. Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank? 
 I will need to leave the office at 5pm tomorrow.  Sara 
 Matthew:  We have had some internal discussions regarding the appropriate Enron party to this master and have concluded that Enron Corp. (the parent of Enron North America Corp.) should be your counterparty.  Does this change warrent any changes with respect to your comments?  Sara 
 Click on doc for language.  SS 
 Sam:  Attached is the FINAL version of the CSFB futures agreement (by separate email I will send you the DRAFT).  I've "eyeballed" it but please verify that all changes were accepted.  I'll help with the application. Let's have Gary sign in the early a.m. (or tonignt, if possible) because CSFB cannot open the account this evening.  Also, per my vm, we need to ensure that the traders on my email to you (from Ellen Su) appear on the authorized traders' list.  Thanks.  ps:  I'm not going anywhere.  However, I have a 5 pm conference call on the Alberta prepay.

 Tanya:  Rodney and Finley are reviewing the two existing Citibank masters (ECT/Nighthawk).  Two swaps will be documented under the ECT/Citibank maste and two under the new Garden State master  (Was Molly in the process of amending that master?  She never returned my voice mail.).   Rodney and/or Finley should call you.  Sara    Tanya Rohauer 09/21/2000 07:22 AM

 Bill:  How do you feel about the comments, per my voice mail.  Sara 
 Bill:  Here's the conference call number. THERE APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE RE:  CASH COLLATERAL (see Item 11 under the "ISDA Schedules" section of the memo. 
 check out the provisions in the memo about the guaranties 
 here's the dial-in number if you want to call in to discuss the guaranty issues 
 Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.  Please call.  713-853-5620.  Sara 
 Pat:  Would you please give Marie a call so that she can update Lotus Notes? I'll be talking with Brent later today.  Thanks.  SS 
 Bill:  We are proposing the following compromise language to the bank regarding "Transfer":  Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate that is a resident for income tax purposes of the United States or Canada.......  We typically don't resrict the jurisdiction of our Affiliates.  Is this O.K. with you? 
 Rats!    Robert Bruce@ENRON Sent by: Robert Bruce@ENRON 09/21/2000 10:10 AM

 Bill:  The attached memo was distributed to legal last week.  We have had a number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial transactions (ranging from short term to quarterly) with governmentals.  As you will see in the memo, the risks are significant.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Sara 
 The attached swaps have been delivered together with the proposal sheets to Lisa Mellencamp. 
 Thanks for the catch!  Sara 
 Marie is checking with Pat Cini for latest update.  We sent this master on 6/23/99.  Also, looks like Pat told you about Empresa.  SS 
 Sara will not be able to attend.  She has another meeting.    Mary Cook 09/22/2000 02:54 PM 
 Attached are revised commodity swap confirms.  I didn't change the rate swap and we're still waiting for input from the bank.

 John:  Hi, there!  As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further that I can do.  That formation should happen today or tomorrow.  With the actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are interested in transacting on.  Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara 
 Stephanie and Sam need NYMEX calendars 
 Sheila:  Please send an email to Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford requesting agreements with Deutsche Bank Securities. Which Enron company(ies) are you requesting these agreements for? Stephanie Panus will be handling this broker. Thanks.  Sara 
 fyi 
 Please advise when you guys are ready for the back-to-back.  SS 
 Sheila:  Please make your request to Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford about the above agreement which John has requested.  Thanks.  SS 
 no changes    Julia H Chin@ENRON 09/25/2000 02:06 PM 
 pls put on my calendar 
 Please comment on the attached draft Citibank agreement. 
 John:  The "signature block" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something like "Company X, as agent for ENA", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency arrangement before proceeding.  You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in writing.  Thanks.  Sara    John Greene 09/25/2000 02:32 PM 
 I hope this works - I tried to tie all to the specific confirms. 
 Sam:  Please let me know ASAP whether Jason should be marking the Deutsche docs based on Sheila's message! 
 Tiffany:  Per my voice mail, please insert the following language into the confirms you are preparing for the Citibank transactions:  FOR THE CITIBANK/GARDEN STATE CONFIRMS:  Optional Termination: Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other party the termination date for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional termination hereunder, the provisions of Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a settlement amount.   FOR THE CITIBANK/ENA CONFIRMS:  Optional Termination:  Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other party the termination date for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional termination hereunder, the provisions of Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a settlement amount.  The foregoing provision for optional termination of this Transaction shall not be cause for Early Termination under the Agreement, and provides for termination of only this Transaction.    Tanya and Rodney:  attached is the side letter 
 Mark:  I know you'll eventually get to this message in the near future. Based on the VOLUME of activity, I would like to have a printer in my office if at all possible.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is a redraft of your letter.  RMT knows nothing about the execution or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a party to that transaction). Also, we have been unable to internally trace the source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.  We are trying to trace this through Chase and expect an answer on Thursday (if we're lucky).  Otherwise, call me about the letter.  Sara 
 This is actually the PacificCorp master which should be redrafted on our new form.  There is a RUSH on this and Dale Rasmussen would like to have the master (I would check with him first to see if this should go to anyone else).  SS 
 fyi 
 need to enter new transaction, contacts, etc. 
 All:  I received another call from Gary Ordway asking for an ISDA and our GTC's.  Has anyone ever done credit?  Sara 
 I know.  You need to speak with me.  Sara    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 09/26/2000 11:34 AM 
 Melissa:  It looks like we'll need GTC's for a yet to be named FP&L counterparty to do this daily call option (spread).  Credit (Ed Sacks) knows about this deal.  You may want to think about the format.  Have we done this before?  Did you work on the Moosehead (Merrill Lynch) deal?  Sara 
 I just received a message that the deal is in a "holding" pattern    Melissa Ann Murphy 09/26/2000 11:55 AM 
 Brent:  will you please respond to Martin.  Thanks.  SS 
 fyi 
 Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation accordingly:  1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial terminations based upon partial asset sales?]  2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need to be sure that the word "sale" is sufficient.  Should we use "financial close" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be contingent or subject to some waiting period. 
 Stephanie:  Are these identical to our docs?  need to check ASAP 
 Please let Rodney/Finley/Tanya know that Mary is assisting on the nego of the new Master.  I'm here if issues arise.  Also, who is minding the confirms? They need to be revised.    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 09/27/2000 12:45 PM 
 ENA's master is with TD, New  York Branch.  Which branch are we dealing with? 
 Yes, I'll be in Death Valley hoping that the weather is as gorgeous as it is today.  Dinner sounds great but I can't get together until after my VACATION.  So let's shoot for after October 15.  By the way, I heard that Joe Manascalco died.  Also, are you still interested in the LSU mineral law institutes?  Have fun in N.O.  Sara    "R. Carson Llewellyn" <carlew@flash.net> 09/27/2000 03:35 PM 
 Scott:  I just wanted to let you know that I am working on a number of quarter-end deals and haven't heard from anyone today about the ESA swap for Raptor 2.  I WILL NOT BE IN THE OFFICE ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29.  However, I will identify a lawyer to assist on this transaction should the need arise. I'll be back in the office on Monday.  Sara 
 I'm putting you on this file.  Rod Nelson is credit - please add him onto Lotus Notes. 
 Please review the blackline.  London is screaming about this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'll try to schedule a conference call for Monday. Sara 
 Paul:  per my voice mail, please let me know if you or Rod will handle.  The FX traders are hollering (on both sides of the Atlantic).  I'd like to chat on Monday, October 2.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Madhur and Aaron:  I am waiting for a response from  credit. Aaron:  You had me confused because you kept referring to Morgan Stanley who we are negotiating with on the equity side.  Who negotiated the Enroncredit.com ISDA? So, this party trades FX and credit?  Sara     Madhur Dayal 09/22/2000 04:51 PM 
 John:  Per our conversation, attached is the copy of the Duke confirm.  The Duke trader is John Miller (713/260-6541). I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging that he never did the deal (the EOL "back office user" shows that the trade WAS done). Please let me know if you need legal assistance. Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached are revised worksheets.  We may sign these deals as early as late today or tomorrow.  Call if you have questions.  SS 
 Here are the only confims that I know of. 
 I will take off the Monday and Tuesday PRIOR to Thanksgiving.  Please advise if any problems.  Sara 
 John:  I spoke with  Kevin Meredith this morning.  1)  Trade Date was 9/11.  EOL system generated confirm 9/12.  All fax attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.  2)  EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).  Duke volume extremely heavy as well. All Duke faxing  unsuccessful.  3)  Duke called Kevin and said "haven't received any confirms since 9/14." Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.  Duke makes no mention of confirms prior to 9/14.  Confirm desk runs a "fax failed" report on 9/25 and picks up the missing confirm.  4)  When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.  Miller says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.  However, this deal shows up on the "back office user."  Let me know if you need anything further.  Kevin's number is 39555.  Sara 
 Fine with me.  I will have to leave at 6 pm Houston.  Brent Hendry (X37124) will be available tomorrow if any issues arise.  Of course, Tana will be here as well.  SS    Greg Johnston 09/28/2000 09:39 AM 
 Kay:  What is this all about?  I don't know anything about "ENOVATE" .  Is it an Enron company?  Sara. 
 These are for ENA/ECC deals 
 Joe:  2 more confirms (appear to be mixed up between RBC and Toronto Dominion. 
 Final two draft confirms for RBC/ECC 
 I spoke with Mark and (after checking one point in the a.m. on jury duty) he thinks that the week of August 16 is preferable for the visit.  I will verify this first thing in the morning.  SS 
 Just a reminder that I will not be in the office on Friday, September 29. Brent Hendry (ext. 37124) will be available to handle any crises.  I'll be back in the office on Monday.  Sara 
 Just a reminder that I will not be in the office on Friday, September 29. Mary Cook (ext. 57732) will be able to handle any crises.  I'll be back in the office on Monday.  Sara

 Don't know if I have the name spelled correctly but I received a call requesting an ISDA Master (for Pushkar Shahi) for trading rate/currency. Thanks.  Sara 
 Deb:  I had a great time seeing you.  Hope you've recovered from the weekend and that Jennifer got back to school alright and Zachary is ready for another week.  How's the house?  Maybe you've seen this message before.  Love, Sas 
 Do you have further information about your pending trip to Canada?  I am reviewing the final letter prepared by Kevin Zemp and he is trying to coordinate with Calgary authorities.  I may be out of town during the week of Aug. 16 and I want your trip to run smoothly.  Give me a call sometime. Thanks.  Sara

 Greg:  I spoke with Joe and he IS working on the internal rate swap with John (i.e., ECC/RMT and RMT/ENA).  Sara 
 Kay:  Attached is the email I received from Steve Curlee.  Who is performing legal/credit for Enovate?  Sara 
 Thursday I'll be there.    Greg Johnston 10/03/2000 09:11 AM 
 All:  Do you know anything about "Enovate"  and whether we are preparing swap documentation for it?  Sara 
 Any idea what this is? 
 Jason:  please hold off on hedge funds for the moment.  Paul may need to rethink the provisions.  Sara 
 I spoke with Kim and she would like for Tim to explain the rationale.  He is traveling today.  She thinks this provision "will not hurt" to have in the agreement since Harvard does not want to change its form!  Also, why don't we say what type of entity Harvard is?  I think it are created by Mass. state law.  How does it go bankrupt? 
 Attached is a revision to the original swap confirmation.  I have tried to incorporate all of the concepts discussed yesterday.  Please send comments or call (X35620).  I will be out of town after noon on Thursday for an offsite. Sara 
 Sorry, I missed your names on the original message.  SS 
 sorry about the attachmet 
 Any word yet on creation of the new entity?  Sara 
 Steve:  Just thought I'd follow up since our conversation of 9/13 to see if you have had an opportunity to redraft the ISDA Schedule and CSA, and, whether you have reviewed the guaranty which Tana Jones delivered to you shortly thereafter.  Please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-5620.  I will be on vacation from Oct. 6 - Oct. 13.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara 
 We would like the opinion to address Section 19(i) of the Accord.  Please call. Sara    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 thanks.  Can you provide me with the appropriate signature block for ENA/ECT Investments Inc. through the agent?    Mahesh Lakhani 10/04/2000 10:01 AM

 Just so that you have a copy.   Also, Steve will prepare a blackline and cc you.  SS 
 Clem:  I gave y;our phone number to Steven Kessler who is the lawyer for Deutsche Bank ("DB") (in New York).  You may recall that you and I spoke earlier about DB's insistence of NO WAITING period to call upon the guarantor (we reduced to two days).  Please call Steve  (212-469-8202) unless he calls you first.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Stephanie:  Per Chris's email below, please send a draft master (without a CSA) for a general corporate (and cc Chris).  Make sure we use the usual disclaimers.  Thanks.  (entry in Lotus Notes also) 
 Bill:  Sorry for the malfunction! 
 Stephanie:  Harvard's outside counsel is in control of drafting this document.  If this is finalized during my absence, I have asked that you help to provide certificates, etc.  Thanks. 
 Just a reminder that I will be on vacation next week.  I am thanking everyone in advance for your help on projects I may have been handling (or should have been handling!).  Kaye will have phone numbers to reach me, if necessary. Sara 
 Jason:  She did call and wanted John, you and me.  I am available untill roughly 11 am when the lawyers depart for the Woodlands.  She indicated that this provision was necessary if we EVER decided to net physical/financial. (Jason:  we won't agree to that now and if we ever did, I am sure we would either amend all of our masters or put a separate netting agreement in place).  She did indicate that Harvard MIGHT drop the request.  I don't particularly want the provision in the agreement.   My calendar is open if you want to schedule.

 Scott:  I need the Grizzly I account information.  Thanks.  Sara 
 John:  Per my voice mail. you need to insure that the right people in London keep me updated on execution and delivery of the appropriate service agreements to permit the U.K. arranger to act for both ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.  Also, you need to advise me of new platforms you are seeking as well as CONTACT NAMES and PHONE/FAX numbers.  In that regard,  (1)  What is Autex?  You have never mentioned this one to me. (2)  I am contacting Instinet but will need the agency agreement which was requested earlier. (3)  I am reviewing ITGL/ITG Europe.

 Attached is the revised Raptor 2 hedge. 
 Bill:  To my knowledge, Enron Corp. has never provided a "true comfort letter" in these situations.  ENE has written a vague letter of ENE's relationship to its sub.  It is possible that the current ENE corporate viewpoint on providing "comfort letters" has changed.  Let me know what you would like for me to do.  SS    William S Bradford 10/10/2000 01:19 PM

 The JV between ENA (or some Enron sub) and Peoples Energy Corporation is called Enovate.  I was on a conference call this afternoon with  Greg Penman, Molly Harris, Stacy Dickson and Kay Mann.  The issues is WHO will negotiate ISDA's ffor the JV (and negotiate the basic ISDA between Peoples and the JV).  You will recall that Haedicke did not want us to negotiate on behalf fo Bridgeline.  Kay is meeting with Mark in about an hour and will raise these issues.  SS

 Do you have access to Lotus Notes?  Serge told us on Oct. 3 that he would have comments no later thatn the week of 10/16 and you would follow up with him. I'll try to call you when I have a free minute.  Sara    "JASON PETERS" <PETEJ@andrews-kurth.com> 10/17/2000 01:57 PM 
 Are you having second thoughts about this? 
 Let's redline (or accept) Ryan's changes and redistribute.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jordan:  Congratulations on your promotion!  I am forwarding to ;you one of the Raptor 2 hedges which was to be finalized earlier this month.  My most recent draft was dated October 5 and I never received comments until this morning (from Ryan Siurek) which prompted the revisions attached.  Ryan is also expecting comments from Rodney Faldon.  I don't know if you have been updated on the various Raptor swaps which have been created over the past few months.  The attached is to hedge ESA assets. I'd be glad to give you a brief overview, as would Ryan.  Thanks.  Sara 
 John:  The Duke issue has arisen once again in connection with the settlements group.  Did you ever resolve the issue? Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at 1:14 pm and the second at 1:28 pm.  Duke agrees wtih the first trade but not the second.  Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sara needs to discuss the Value of Financial Agreements" section with you before she can agree. I've attached her revised document. 
 Rod will be available at 3 pm to discuss.  SS 
 Laurel:  BNP Paribas is fine.  Repos are on my list.  Sara  p.s.  I had a great vacation!    Laurel Adams 10/18/2000 02:28 PM 
 FYI - I spoke with Thomas Fay in NY about setting up Instinet in London.  I HAVE BOTH INSTINET FILES IN MY OFFICE.  Sam, I told Thomas that we do not need copies of any agreements.  You must have been looking for them while I was on vacation.  Remember, broker'futures agreements are in RED files to make them visible.  SS 
 here it is 
 Clem:  We have gone back and forth with Serge Martin who is negotiating for Florida P&L.  I think that you need to contact him and have a conversation. If you prefer to give your negotiable comments to me, I'll be glad to move forward.  We are finished with the ISDA.  Thanks for your help.  Sara 
 Sam/Stephanie:  Do we have an executed version for Global Contracts and our files? 
 I would like to have this agreement executed during the week of Oct. 23. Please resolve with counterparty and discuss with me. 
 Please fax the ORIGINAL confirm.  Thanks.  SS    Jorge A Garcia@ENRON 10/20/2000 02:17 PM 
 Sorry to be so picky here, but do we also have CSFB's signature?    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 10/20/2000 03:30 PM 
 Please send update back to V&E.  Note room change and YOUR NAME and info. Thanks.  Sara 
 Regarding Aneela's request for execution of an "Electronic Order Execution Agreement", please send your usual message to Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, etc.  The agreement is drafted for execution by Enron Corp.  Please identify the Enron trading signatory(ies).  Thanks.  Sara 
 Sorry for the last minute (general unavailability of attendees), but I have arranged a meeting to discuss general issues on the paper & pulp desk at 2 pm in EB 38C2.  Dale Neuner, Tanya Rohauer, Rudi Zipter, Ted Murphy should be attending.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Brent:  In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements, licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie and me) have established a "process" which includes the following:  1.  sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and necessity for agreement  2.  depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get involved.  3.  the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track the process.  4.  upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global contracts.  To my knowledge, we have not established a procedure for tracking passwords (to the extent required/changed).  I understand that Jason is handling three ENA weather license agreements for you (Risk Management Solutions,Inc., Foresight Weather LLC and Air Worldwide Weather).  Jason has (or will have) access to Lotus Notes to enter his comments.  Thanks.  Sara

 Tanya:  SITA wants to know what is taking so long to finalize the ISDA! Also, I ran into Michael M. last night and he even asked!  Do you know who is handling?  Sara 
 I am still waiting for a copy of the services agreement and the form of signature.  Instinet is proceeding but will still require this information. Thanks.  Sara    Sara Shackleton 10/16/2000 03:14 PM 
 Tracy:  Netting (payment or closeout) only applies between the parties under a single master agreement. Are you asking about the right of setoff in the event of an early termination under one of the masters?    Tracy Ngo 10/24/2000 11:29 AM 
 I spoke with Steve Kessler this morning.  He told me that he agreed with Carol to net commodity transactions (which was actually more than he wanted to agree to!).  However, DB does not have the systems to net within other product groups.  Sara 
 I know it's on your list.  I'm only sending this message so that I don't forget!  ss 
 Mary:  Attached is an early draft of notice which I had prepared for the AVICI swap.  I thnk we may changed the Termination provision of the confirm shortly after this was drafted.  Hope this helps.  Sara 
 Jorge:  You are trying to be too efficient!  Just kidding, because I just had a conversation wtih the U.K  tax person and the following issues remain unresolved but are in the process of being addressed:  1.  credit.com payment, back-office and negotiation 2.  Enron Japan trading (online/offline) 3.  London online FX hedging 4.  London equity hedging  Sorry I can't give you any answers right now.  All of these issues are tax-driven and are being addressed.  Sara    Jorge A Garcia@ENRON 10/24/2000 02:11 PM 
 Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?  (2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having problems connecting with him?  Sara 
 My schedule is currently open and I will make myself available to meet with Janine.  Sara    Louise Bird 10/25/2000 02:59 AM 
 You are correct. By copy of this message,  I will ask Tana to finalize.  Sara    William S Bradford 10/25/2000 07:55 AM 
 Jason:  Which files have you left messages for Mark Elliott?  Have you emailed and phoned?  Are you up and running on Lotus Notes?  SS    "JASON PETERS" <PETEJ@andrews-kurth.com> 10/24/2000 05:57 PM 
 Mark:  Just in case you're curious, attached is a listing of items Jason is handling for the group.  I'm trying to keep track. 
 All:  Please let me know if something is missing from the attached list. Thanks.  Sara 
 I received a call from John Powell reuqesting copies of the agreements for transacting on EOL (for the legal department).  He was asking about arbitration and other items.  He didn't specifically ask for GTC's so you may want to inquire.  Thanks.  Sara phone 281/378-1114 fax        281/378-1151 
 Louise:  I received a call from Jeff Blumenthal (Houston tax) who would like to be included in the meeting.  His availability is Friday only.  Thanks. Sara    Louise Bird 10/25/2000 02:59 AM 
 FYI - We have not received anything.  Have you?  ss    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 A document entitled "Third Party Connection:  Customer Profile" showed up in my inter-office mail. What is this in relation to?  What company?  Who requested?   Why? Thanks.  Sara 
 Kaye:  can you please print for me?  what am I doing wrong?  Sara 
 Have you ever heard back from Liz Fernandez or Desiree Monroe? 
 Sam:  Please be sure to let Russell know when Cinergy goes out today.  He should have sent you the addressee.  Sara 
 Jim:  Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex. The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of specific negotiations.  Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, is also required.  I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.  You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not been customized.  Please feel free to call if you have any questions.  Sara 
 Bill and Tanya:  Clint would like to finalize Lehman and CSFB, in that order.  We are in the midst of transferrring a swap from Merrill to Lehman.  Thanks for your help. Sara

 Hi, Thomas!  I know that you're in London and I was just checking to see if I was to have received something from your NY office for me to sign.  Please let me know. Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:  (1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus  (2)  Credit Suisse First Boston International [no form of master]  (3)  Deutsche Bank [have a form of master from ENA negotiations]  (4)  Bear Stearns International Limited [no form of master] - Samantha Boyd  (5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. [may develop form from ENA negotiations]  (6)  Credit Agricole Indosuez  Tanya:  Please let me know if any of the foregoing require parent guaranties.  Clint:  Please identify the lawyer to whom I should address comments.  Also, are there any others?  ENE has an agreement with Toronto Dominion, NY Branch.  Samantha:  Please assign Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and let me know who is handling. 
 My notes reflect that we last spoke with CSFB on 9/15/00.  I do not have a revised confirm (much less a signed confirm) in my files.  Sara 
 Mark:  Can I go ahead and give to Angela?  Sara 
 Ellen:  per our earlier conversation, I have faxed comments to both companies, to the attention of their "negotiators" with whom I spoke earlier this morning.  I will call in the morning to discuss and I hope we can finalize and fax signature tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 All:  I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk. I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be providing Kim with a list of "issues" and we have been invited to add to that list.  Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.  You may ignore the message below.  Thanks.  Sara

 Steve:  I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since our conversations in mid-September.  I have only a "draft" confirmation dated May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further discussions.  Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.  FYI, I have not received comments from Mike Enerson.  Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?  Thanks.  Sara 
 fine with me - just verify final time and location.  Sara    Louise Bird 10/30/2000 07:43 AM 
 If I finish my 9 am early, I'll call you.  In any event, I'll find a way for us to hook up today or tomorrow.  Sara    Angela Davis@ENRON 10/30/2000 06:56 AM 
 Jason:  Please let me know where we stand on this and what steps we are currently taking to finalize.  On a different matter, I spoke with Mike Neves on Friday afternoon and we concluded that getting you hooked up to Lotus Notes was becoming too complicated.  Please email your updates to me and I will enter onto Lotus Notes.  Thanks.  Sara  P.S.  I have approved all of your invoices for payment.

 Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice mail?  SS 
 Jim:  I didn't know if Clint had already forwarded this to you.  Sara 
 Ryan:  Here's the redraft of Lehman.  THE CAP is something Clint and I want to discuss with you again.  Sara

 Mahesh:  I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning:  What company actually employs John Greene?  I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must sign a new confidentiality agreement for the UK terminal (for trading by ECT Investments, Inc. through its arranger Enron Investment Services Limited). Please advise by email or voice mail  Thanks  Sara    Mahesh Lakhani 10/31/2000 03:47 AM 
 Tanya:  Bill was assigned to this master which we sent out in 1997.  Per my email yesterday, we need new credit and a new person assigned.  I think Rod will handle credit when we dupe the ENA master for EnronCredit.com.  Please let me know who will handle.  There are some issues that credit and legal can determine before we resend a first draft.  Thanks.  Sara

 These are all REPOS:  Merrill Lynch Canada Inc./ENA Merrill Lylnch Govt. Securities Inc./Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith Inc/ENA UBS Warburg LLC/ENA 
 Andy:  In the spirit of "full disclosure", I thought I would let you know what ENA has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities. ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95). There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997). All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language (in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.  I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:  change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time) delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required language delete the arbitration provision in its entirety  I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that we can finalize docs by the afternoon.  Thanks for your assistance.  Sara 
 Ellen:  When you have a minute, give me a call and let's discuss, especially notice, assignability.  The BIG ENRON issue is limited liability (I have no choice here).  Setoff can be compromised with credit's approval (Paul Radous is credit).  Sara 
 OK, this is hot off the press. Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 1.1 times outstanding exposure.  The collateral was defined only as Letters of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.  As to the Threshold, well, you can read the response. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. SS 
 Andy:  I am reviewing your comments and will have an answer shortly.  I thought, however, that you should know that the limitation of liability provision is non-negotiable from Enron's viewpoint.  If this is problematic, please advise and we can halt further discussion.  Thanks.  Sara    "Waskow, Andrew (OGC)" <AWaskow@exchange.ml.com> 10/31/2000 06:33 PM 
 Julia:  Could I please have a copy of the executed swap confirm?   Thanks (especially for all of your help).  Sara

 Visit their website at: www.vintageestate.com  Monday, November 20, I have scheduled the following appointments:  Beginning at 4 pm:  Deb - facial, then massage  Sara- massage, then facial  Steve- massage, then !!!!!!!!!!!!  Villagio does not have reflexology.  I didn't know if Steve wanted a facial (but if he does, there is no one to do the facial at 5!) Seriously, check their website for other services for Steve (and you).  I was only trying to time all of our services together, but that may not be entirely necessary. I don't know what time dinner is on Monday but I'm assuming it is late enough to allow us to change clothes and shower (and wash hair if we feel like it). The spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on Sunday.  So we can make changes.  This is particularly important since all changes must be made within 24 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card.  And I really hate unnecessary charges.  On a slightly different note, I am compiling places I'd like to visit since we have no itinerary.  Then we can have a tribal meeting to vote.  Big Tiger Feather has changed his plans to stay until Tuesday so we'll have two cars.  Bye now!  Love, Sas (the future Miss America over FFFFFFFFFFFFF) 
 Paul:  Please let me know if you can be available for a conference call with Jason on Friday to discuss Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley Cap Services. Thanks.  Sara 
 Please reassign this file this morning and ask the responsible paralegal to bring the file in my office to discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Paul:  We'll meet Friday at 2 pm to call Jason.  Can you come up to my office?  Sara    Paul Radous@ENRON 11/01/2000 05:37 PM 
 Paul was too nervous using the local firm of Tindall & Foster.  Kevin Zemp was recommended by our Calgary office.  Kevin refined the prior information and will "pre-clear" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through Calgary around 8/24/99.  Do you have any comments to the new attachment?  SS

 Hey, Carol!  November 15 looks like a great day.  Any other day (except Friday) could work.  Sara    Carol St Clair 10/30/2000 10:36 AM 
 Susan:  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We have agreed to delete the CSA and will return a blackline to you shortly.  You may recall that SITA expressly requested that the Enron agreement be governed by English law which is why we prepared this document for execution by our affiliate in London with the jurisdiction language appearing in the prior draft.  There are still issues posed by your markup and we should be able to schedule a conference call next week.  Thanks.  Sara    "Susan Hopkinson" <susan.hopkinson@lovells.com> 10/09/2000 03:27 AM 
 FYI - we will be negotiating this master.  Sara 
 We may find out today so hold the Master.  We are waiting for Lehman to revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to "clean up" behind his attorney to make sure that there are really not any other changes to the Schedule!  Paul has been traveling for the last two days and should be back in the office today.  Clint Freeland (our trader) will let us know more.  SS    Stephanie Panus@ENRON 11/03/2000 08:41 AM 
 Pat:  I am a financial trading attorney with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") in the Houston office.  Christian Yoder gave me your name and suggested that we speak regarding the EWEB transaction.  I will be negotiating the ISDA Master Agreement with EWEB, probably with Jmi Deason directly.  ENA requires that governmentals provide specific evidence of authority to enter into derivative instruments (including certified resolutions specifically authorizing execution of the master agreement and all transactions thereunder, legal opinion and additional reps/warranties). I was curious as to the specific documentation you had reviewed from EWEB. It sounded from your email which Christian forwarded to me, that you were reviewing evidence of authority to enter into physical transactions.  I would like to speak with you directly, if possible.  I am in a Central time zone and my direct line is (713) 853-5620.  I look forward to speaking with you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and conditions).  Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.  Most counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached Annex A.  Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the "executed" confirmation?  Do we need to modify our language incorporating the Annex A?  Thanks.  Sara (713/853-5620) 
 Without having more detail, I do know that Gary is interested in trading from Houson (if at all possible).  ss 
 addresss correction 
 here's the political decision helper - 
 fyi 
 Russell:  I spoke briefly with Paul about your long-dated commodity deal and have a few comments.  (1)  Have you spoken with anyone on the confirmation desk about preparing a draft confirm?  Joe Hunter (X33316) is a good start.  (2)  Paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and CSFB Int'l (name change from Credit Suisse Financial Products).  In that regard, you should be sure to add the following items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty:  (a)  ENA should be the Calculation Agent for purposes of this transaction.  (b)  You should provide for "Payments on Early Termination" as:  "For the purpose of Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement,  (i)  Loss will apply, and (ii) the Second Method will apply."  Also, you should obtain evidence of the name change (usually a certificate of name change).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara 
 FYI - this is the proposed Schedule which we will review and comment; EWEB did not send a CSA. Sara 
 Surprise!  Tax does not yet have an answer.  But I'll call you anyway.  Sara    Dale Neuner 11/03/2000 04:00 PM 
 OK, you guys, I'm trying my best.  All appointments on Monday, November 20 have been moved to 3 P.M.  Deb:  facial, then massage  Steve:  80 minute wellness massage  Steve:  the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought you'd like a longer massage.  There are facial appointments available Sunday morning and afternoon.  You may want to check the website and change the service.  You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and I'll take yours.  Let me know if you'd like for me to make changes.  Otherwise, see you in wineland.  Sara 
 Did anyone work on the Destec transaction?  Sara 
 Susan:  How about any of Wednesday - Friday, Nov.8, 9 or 10?  Houston is on Central Std. Time.  Let me know.  Sara    "Susan Hopkinson" <susan.hopkinson@lovells.com> 11/03/2000 05:38 AM

 Yes, please call.  I actually commented to Edmund on this confirm last Friday and he apparently took none of my suggestions.  Sara 
 Please see the attached Schedule and look at Part 3 (Documents to be delivered) under the headings for Party B (which is EWEB): 
 Hey, guys:  I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England and Wales.  I believe that Michael drafted originally.  (1)  submission to English courts and waiver of all objections  (2)  setoff  for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger  Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?  Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal Tuesday,  Nov. 7.   Thanks.  Sara

 Please add Angela Davis of Enron to all e-mails regarding Project Tahiti. Her e-mail address is Angela.Davis@enron.com.  Thank you,  Kaye Ellis Assistant to Sara Shackleton 
 Good morning!  Thanks for your help yesterday. Would you please CALL A&K and make sure that they add Angela Davis to the distribution?   Thanks.  Sara 
 Jane:  If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).  I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John. Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara    Jane McBride@ENRON 11/07/2000 04:03 AM 
 Yes.  I thought you understood as much from our meeting.  I have asked A&K repeatedly to add you to the email list.  Also, it was my understanding from Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the "structured" equity derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).  Please let me know if I'm assuming too much.  Thanks.  Sara    Angela Davis@ENRON 11/08/2000 06:45 AM 
 Please note in Lotus Notes.  ss 
 Holly:  I'll try to get something to EWEB today.  Also, we don't prepare deemed ISDA's for muni's so I have to create a form.  Sara 
 Hey, Lawyer Daigle:  On November 17, I'll be exercising my wheelchair along the winding roads of Napa and Sonoma Valleys.  However, would you two kids be interested in the more popular seminar at Galatoires on Dec. 8, entitled "Dot.com for Seniors", 3 hours CLE credit requested?  Please let me know as soon as possible so that I can request my cheap senior fare on Southwest Airlines, a reduced rate rental car and other freebies afforded through the AARP.  Sara    "P. Keith Daigle" <pkdaigle@neosoft.com> 11/08/2000 04:09 PM Please respond to pkdaigle 
 Janine:  Thank you for scheduling the meeting last week.  Let me know if I can be of any help whatsoever.  Also, whatever flowcharts or schematics you can offer would greatly appreciated, as well as a list of services agreements.  Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on EOL.  Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal hedging FX products for London and Japan.  Am I correct in the following?  RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing services agreements. ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties. Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the situation should arise?)  Thanks.  Sara 
 Andy:  Attached are my blacklined comments to the prior draft.  Please let me know if this works.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Jane:  the ISDA jurisdiction and waiver of jury trial language is fine.  Sara 
 You lucky dog!!!!!!!!!!!!    Kaye Ellis 11/09/2000 09:25 AM 
 David:  Pursuant to our conversation, attached is my blackline.  I'll verify jurisdiction.  Thanks.  Sara 
 We're done.  I should have signed docs tomorrow.  Sara    Caroline Abramo@ENRON 11/09/2000 10:24 AM 
 Angela:  Will you be available?  I was hoping that you can handle these deals with swap group assistance.  Please feel free to call upon me at any time. Thanks.  Sara 
 Dale:  do you still want to meet?  Are you waiting to receive Janine's email tomorrow?  Can I buy you lunch one day?  Sara 
 Finalizing flight plans here.  Will you be flying to B.A. with us from Sao Paulo? If so, will you arrange for transportation from the airport?  My assistant Kaye should have our flight info and can coordinate with you. Thanks.  It looks as though Andrea B. is coordinating with the business people and outside counsel. 
 All:  At Clint's request, please find below the form of assignment for execution among Enron North America Corp., Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A..  I will have to fax the term sheet to you as I can't find it in my email.  Sara 
 Peter:  I didn't have your fax number to send you a copy of the term sheet (it's your term sheet of August 7, 2000).  I have faxed already to Leslie and Gary.  I will fax to you if you would please send me your email address. Thanks.  Sara 
 Not really.  I usually ask to be conferenced in when the swap is discussed, give my comments to Danny Sullivan only (if A&K is outside counsel) or listen to as much as I need to.  It's really your call.  SS    Angela Davis@ENRON 11/09/2000 04:18 PM 
 John:  Have you seen this?  Please call me.  Sara 
 Stephanie:  I have put you in charge of this CP (formerly S. Flynn).  We are going to have to amend the Coll. Threshold.  I need to speak with Russell and will give you details.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Never!  Where is this coming up?    Angela Davis@ENRON 11/10/2000 10:14 AM

 Clint:  Please verify cap of 4,164,300, Price Trigger Event occuring at USD 55.00 for 3 consecutive Exchange Business Days and Spread of +.60 % from 8/4/00 through 11/16/00 and +.80% from 11/17/00 through 8/4/01.  Ryan:  Check my voice mail about revising your language to add "in bankruptcy or in liquidation". 
 Marcus:  Can you please let me know what you need. Who is handling credit?  tax?  accounting? Who is booking the confirmations?  Have the confirms been drafted or negotiated?  Any changes?  How many transactions?  Sara 
 Thursday is Nov. 16.    Kaye Ellis 11/13/2000 12:00 PM 
 Leslie:  Per our conversation, you mentioned that you had comments to the form of assignment to be executed by you, Lehman and Enron North America Corp..  Would you please provide me with your comments so that I  can forward the same to Lehman?  I know that the Merrill name needs to be corrected. Thanks.  Sara 
 David:  Have you had a chance to consider our comments?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Gareth:  Per your voice mail.  Marcus thought this was closing next week.  I will be out on Monday and Tuesday and will have to find a backup.  Let me know if you have further info.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Looks fine to me.  SS

 I don't know a thing about this deal!  I am expecting Marcus to call me this morning for further explanation.  Forgive my ignorance, but what is a CACS? Thanks.  Sara    Treasa Kirby 11/14/2000 08:37 AM 
 Sharon & Susan:  We will send blackline shortly.  With respect to your fax of 11/10/00, please note the following:  1.  continuing guaranty is fine 2.  Rider A will require further discussion and is not acceptable 3.  30 days is too long and not justifiable but we are agreeable to extend time to  10 Business Days 4.  Replacement credit support is not acceptable  If you still wish to pursue unacceptable items, please advise and I will try to  arrange a call for you and the Enron Corp. lawyer, Clement Abrams, who is currently out of town.  He returns tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Joya,  Here is Sara's report. 
 Treasa:  Your diagram identifies "Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto". Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA agreement?  Did the bank change its name?  I'll wait for the term sheet and the draft TD confirms which you mentioned in your email.  Sara 
 FYI 
 Clem:  Would you please contact  Susan Hopkinson about the guaranty.  She works in Paris and her phone number is 33 1 53 67 4747.  Thanks.  Sara  ps  I have separtely emailed to you the blacklined guaranty. 
 Brent:  I wanted to inquire about SMUD.  After the legal/credit meeting, it sounded as though special deal language was going into the Schedule as opposed to the confirm for the Transaction.  Thanks.  Sara 
 I was looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and hope that we can arrange something soon.  I'm not sure about my plans during the Thanksgiving holiday but I think I'll be spending most of it in Houston.  I am taking a long weekend (this weekend) in Napa with my sister, brother-in-law and Mike to celebrate my birthday so I'm anticipating somewhat of an eating exttavaganza.  Talk to you soon.  Sara 
 Did a swap 2002-2008 term with BofA.  Please send confirm to me upon receipt.  Need to negotiate early termination.  Thanks.  SS 
 All:  PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS PREPAY  (1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by legal and credit.  (2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for upgrading to an ISDA.  Rod:  You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement now and we should discuss.  Treasa:  Will there be a rate swap?  Under which master(s)? 
 Didn't we send this out?  SS 
 Hey, Russell:  Are you handling the "Cargill-Alliant, LLC" credit?  Sara 
 There are TWO (2) Enron affiliates having master agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG"):  (1)  ECTRIC has an ISDA Master Agreement with MSCG dated 3/25/99 but effective as of 8/29/97  (2)  ECT (now ENA) has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with MSCG dated, and effective, as of 6/16/92  With respect to the TD (TEXAS) master agreement having a "RESTRICTED" status, I will need to speak with Rod Nelson.  Sara    Treasa Kirby 11/15/2000 09:50 AM 
 Rod:  You need to speak with Treasa.    Rod Nelson 11/15/2000 12:21 PM 
 Here it is 
 Bob:  I'm only sending this message so that you can see all correspondence. This doc will be useful to you. 
 this is from Jason 
 Kevin:  This is set to close tomorrow (so far!).  Please look this first draft over to see if you have any issues.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Would you please convert this doc?  SS 
 ENA and ECTRIC have masters with this counterparty. I NEED THESE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPAY ORIGINATING FROM LONDON WHICH CLOSES TOMORROW. These are both missing from the files. Does anyone have these?  Please contact me ASAP!  Thanks.  Sara 
 I guess "working it out"?  The collateral piece will take a little time and we'll have to run it by Japanese counsel.    John Suttle 11/16/2000 08:44 AM 
 Treasa:  Do you have a deal diagram?  Is there a commodity swap between ENA and Morgan? The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding "loan repayment" and the "fee".  Has Matt seen this?  Shouldn't this be in a separate document?  Also, I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the Master?). Do want TD to be the Calc. Agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap? Are you satisfied wtih the Disruption Fallback (which is the same as the Master but for the reduction in  Postponement from 5 to 3 days). I am trying to speak with Rod.  Sara    Treasa Kirby 11/16/2000 05:13 AM 
 Marcus:  The MSCG Master is NOT AN ISDA!  I am sure there will be problems "matching" terms for the swaps.  sara 
 here's the email 
 Angela:  I just received this email from Carol.  Do you know about this? It's the first I've seen (unless it's related to something that Mary is working on).  Would you please follow up?  It's coming from A&K.  Thanks. Sara  Second message to follow 
 Here's the second message. 
 Hi, Greg:  Per my voice mail, could you please email or fax the final confirms to me? Thanks.  Sara 
 Bob:  Would you please handle?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Carol and Mary:  I am not available on 12/8.  Sara    Carol St Clair 11/16/2000 11:22 AM 
 Just to update you:  1.  I think that our travel plans are fairly well set and I know that Kaye has spoken with you on several items. 2.  Mark wanted to be sure that in Sao Paulo, meetings were being scheduled with outside counsel (which I believe Andrea is handling), with Randy Young (can you attend to that please?) and ESA necessary commercials (Andrea handling?). 3.  Mark wanted to make certain that we got on Don Black's calendar while in B.A.  Could you look into that as well?  For my own edification, who are Luiz Maurer and Orlando Gonzalez?  Please let me know if there is anything elso you need form me.  I'll bring you up to date on Hickerson shortly.  Thanks,  Sara 
 Now do you see what's going on? 
 Kaye:  I need for you to redline the first attached doc.  I have the markup in my office.  I need to email it tonight. Thanks.  Sara 
 Matt Dawson in London was inquiring about this agreement.  He'll want to know when we are finished because he has a London paper trader nagging him.  SS 
 Marcus:  TD has scheduled a conference call with me at 10:30 am Houston time to discuss the crude swap (related to the prepay).  Mataly Sahoni (?) said that they wanted to discuss some "credit issues" and that it was "no big deal."  You are welcome to join me.  Sara  P.S.  Bob Bruce (Ext. 57780; EB 3880D) will back me up while I am out of the office tomorrow afternoon, Monday and Tuesday. I'll be back on Wednesday, Nov. 22. 
 Yes, because Treasa told me this morning that this could "make or break the deal"!  Of course, you are absolutely welcome to join me (and Marcus if he is available).  Sara    Robert Bruce@ENRON Sent by: Robert Bruce@ENRON 11/16/2000 04:42 PM 
 Attached is my markup of the TD crude confirm which I received this morning. Sara 
 Here we go again!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Please assign in the morning for preparation on Friday, Nov. 17.  Whoever receives needs to call Chris Foster in Portland to coordinate.  Thanks.  sara 
 Attached is a template for an ISDA swap.  I will fax a copy of a "real" financial power Transaction (which is routine as opposed to a structured deal!).  Call if you have any questions.  SS 
 Please join the conference call at 11;30 am New York time 
 THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Mary Cook 11/17/2000 08:29 AM 
 WE ARE ALSO CONFERENCING AT 10:30 am Houston time! 
 You bet!  Belated to you.  I'm off to Napa in a few hours to celebrate.  I'll call after T-giving.  Sara    "Virginia Hodge" <virginia.hodge@painewebber.com> 11/17/2000 10:49 AM 
 Have a great holiday.  I'm out of here!!!!!!!!!!    "Virginia Hodge" <virginia.hodge@painewebber.com> 11/17/2000 11:40 AM 
 I am finalizing the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement with SITA.  You will recall that this is an ECTRIC; master NOT ENA.  SITA has (1) requested evidence of EEFT's ability to sign for ECTRIC and (2) confirmation that "EEFT is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services directive".  Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows:  Susan Hopkinson and Sharon Lewis at Lovells in Paris:  susan.hopkinson@lovells.com sharon.lewis@lovells.com  If you require phone or fax:  Tel:  33 1 53 67 47 47 Fax:  33 1 47 23 96 12  Please let me know when you have satisfied this request.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Richard:  I don't know if you were copied separately on this message.  Can you send a letter after Thanksgiving?  The first payment should come due the first week in December.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Tanya:  SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).  What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.  Sara 
 Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall. We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with something to help my brain.  Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died of liver cancer.  I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.  So, Carson, what's new with you??????????????????????????? 
 FYI - comments were sent to Duke and Duke's NY lawyer today.  I doubt that there will be any issues.  SS 
 Treasa:  Bob Bruce told me that there was no "swap" activity on the prepay during my absence. Houston is closed down until Monday, Nov. 27 for the Thanksgiving holiday. Normally, I would ask Joe Hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the confirms.  I marked up the TD confirm to reflect my comments and provide an attached "schedule" of volumes since I thought it would be easier for you to match calc periods, volumes and rate payment dates.  Such a format has worked well in other prepaid structures.  If I don't go out of town tomorrow,  you can  reach me at home. My number is (713) 664-3207. 
 Tana:  Richard Sage, CFO for EnronCredit.com, would like a link to be able to access Lotus Notes.  Could you please arrange?  Thanks.  Sara 
 Richard:  It was good to meet you this afternoon.  Attached is my Q&A for the traders regarding  the U.S. concept of "Eligible Swap Participant".  Let me know if I can be of further help. Also, I asked Tana Jones to send you the link for our Financial Trading Lotus Notes database.  Sara 
 Are we meeting at noon?  Can I assume that Lawyer Burlingame will procure a table at the seminar?   Sara    "P. Keith Daigle" <pkdaigle@neosoft.com> 11/17/2000 04:57 PM Please respond to pkdaigle 
 Jeff:  If you don't have an answer yet, try to call Jeff Hodge.  Sara 
 Tanya:  This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.  We are also seeing lots of prepays.  Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?  Should we immediately involve you and Bill?  At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are juggling the deals.  Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.  Thanks.  Sara 
 Did you have your questions answered?  I have a voice mail from Philip Levy and need to respond.  Please give me a call after Thanksgiving.  Thanks. Sara 
 He is a lawyer for APEA.  Can I call him and let him know that the confirm was sent to APEA?  When was it sent?  Sara    Diane Anderson@ENRON 11/27/2000 08:16 AM 
 Please note regarding "finance deals, prepays".

 I am tied up this morning.  SS    Kathryn Thomas 11/28/2000 03:14 AM 
 Susan:  Why is the RMT/NNG on hold?  A two-year deal was booked in mid-November and we'd like to confirm under a master.  Thanks.  Sara 
 John:  I don't know if you've been in touch with Instinet but they are now holding up the documents.  Instinet could not find the ECT Investments, Inc. executed 1997 agreements (which I have resent to them) and I now have their lawyer agreed to amend that agreement to add the London terminal.  This should be a minor item.  Can you put pressure on New York?  Sara 
 Treasa:  Please add "Robert Bruce" to the distribution list (either Bob or I will be available to assist from ENA legal).  Also, please keep Cathy Moehlman (ENA Treasury - X33353) in the loop as she calls us for information that we may not have.  Thanks.  Sara     Treasa Kirby 11/28/2000 09:38 AM 
 Mark:  Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.  At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal should handle Enovate legal work.  That work currently consists of establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.  It is not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).  Bill Bradford will have the final word on Enovate credit.  Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.  Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master agreements?  Or should we just handle as any other project?  Sara 
 Laurel:  Looks like this is being handled properly.  You just need to stay on top of it.  SS 
 Please let me know who handles this one.  Our power trader is Joe Wagner (X33143) and the draft should be emailed to John Porter:  japorter@tva.gov Joe would like an update.  John Porter will direct to a TVA lawyer.  Thanks. Sara 
 Jim:  Thanks for following up.  Sara    Jim Armogida@ENRON 11/28/2000 09:49 AM 
 Joe:  Susan Bailey (X34737) will be drafting the TVA master.  I don't think it will go out today; maybe, tomorrow.  Please feel free to call Susan (or me) if you have any questions.  Negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name, phone number and email address for the counterparty's LAWYER (I know you tried!).  If the counterparty is truly anxious to trade, the commercial guys will pressure the legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball rolling.  Otherwise, things will sit around and go nowhere.  Just remember that an ISDA negotiation is USUALLY longer with a governmental entity because ENA requires more information (legal opinion, copies of statutes, authority in the form of a full Board resolution, etc.) and government lawyers may be short staffed.  Sometimes the counterparty will hire outside counsel which may go more quickly, but not always.  If a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading documents, the negotiations may end within a week (but I have never seen this happen with a governmental).  Otherwise, it simply depends on the issues.  Sara 
 Can you be more specific?  Is this for ENA?  What type of products?    Lynn Tippery 11/28/2000 01:26 PM 
 1.  Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language. 2.  A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with respect to counterp
