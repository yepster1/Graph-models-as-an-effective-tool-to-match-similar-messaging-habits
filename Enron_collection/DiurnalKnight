"That's good I guess... Remember though, if he ever ends up being an asshole, I can take care of him for you."*She is quiet*"He better keep that promise.""It ain't about strength sometimes.""Still... You're getting into dangerous things, Nightshade. Not just dangerous for you.""It's going to be dangerous for everyone you know."*She is quiet for a bit, then says* "Nightshade, have I ever told you what I do? Or rather what I'm supposed to do according to my mother.""Well, no sense sugarcoating it. I'm an assassin."*A tall figure is hunched near the middle of the deck, fiddling with what looks like a harpoon. Their long coat and wide-brimmed hat obscures most of their appearance, however*"Ya, sorry to drop that on you. More importantly though, I know things about being an assassin, not just the fighting work, but the 'business' end of it."[sorry, I meant deck of the ship not deck of the harbor.]*She sighs* "A lot of jobs aren't to kill a gang boss, or a politician, or a political figure, or even an unfaithful spouse- most jobs are to kill people who those guys care about. It's easier, faster, and sends a message."[okay!]"It will. It's not a matter of hope."*The figure turns towards him, the large hat it wears casts a shadow that obscures its face, but two gleaming red points which are likely eyes shine through*"You were literally in the middle of the streets asking for volunteers.""Well that doesn't make it less dangerous."*She sighs* "Sorry if I'm being a downer.""I'm just worried that you don't understand *how* dangerous it is.""Sorry for bringing it up."*Lilith seems too busy eating a large cooked salmon to care really, but she is nearby**Lilith looks over at her after a bit, staring silently for a few seconds before ripping off a hunk of the fish she was enjoying and holding it out, offering it to Katie**Shortly afterwords, Dolly begins to spin downwards, bringing herself in for a landing**She shrugs and keeps eating**Well, she seems to be flying towards the Millennium Institute for Powered Youth. Upon squinting, that is most certainly a girl with wings and not just somebody wearing a jetpack or a large bird or something**Lilith puts down her food and fumbles around looking for her notepad**She takes it out and scrawls one of her usual messy messages, it says YOU ARE NICE**Having just landed, She is a bit busy stretching her legs at the moment and hasn't noticed it*"Huh? Eep!" *She moves to the side* "Oh, it's just a cat. Hey there kitten."*Lilith nods, and with her mask pulled up to eat her smile can actually be seen for once**Lilith is a bit busy gorging herself on what looks like a large salmon to take note of him**Lilith then goes back to her meal*[end?]*Dolly is waiting near the entrance to the school for her dad to show up*[she's going to land near the school]*She sighs* "Why do they always do that? I like them..."[hopefully!][oh! I like bees! They're fuzzy!][though she would need a lot of flowers for that!][yep! but most whole beehives can only make a few cups of honey a day. Of course you could just make her be friends with a plant manipulator, like Thorn!][oh! will she live in a little hive with little hexagon thingies?][if she lays eggs wouldn't she be a queen bee though? They don't make honey][they can? I did not know that! I like learning things.][how odd!]*She shrugs and lets out a bit of a growling noise in response*[oh... that's a bit [lewd](http://i.imgur.com/XrZeD2q.gif)...]*The figure pulls a small notepad out of one of its coat pockets, and writes a short poorly-written message, it says I UNDERSTND YOU*"Just... try to be less obvious in the future."*Lilith is nearby, gorging herself on what looks like a large salmon**Dolly is waiting near the entrance to the campus, waiting for her father to arrive*[I dunno, it probably depends on how you present it and how much detail you go into. Just kind of hand-waiving that "it happens, that's it, no need to go into detail" would probably be fine]*She turns towards him and waves. Her mask is pulled up to let her eat, meaning her mouth can be seen for once. She is giving a friendly (if a bit macabre given the amount of dead fish in it) smile**She holds out a chunk of salmon to him, she seems to be offering it*[well, whatever happens I hope you have fun with your character!][I understand! I hope you have fun with Carissa too then!][ooc: okay! I just wanted to suggest one thing, since since Lilith has almost identical level of power (in basic stats, strength, speed, toughness, etc) other than the fact that Skybreaker is faster and Lilith is tougher it might be fun if they end having a duel thing at some point]"H-hey! Stop that!" *She begins trying to think about how to get the cat off without any hands without hurting herself or the cat. Also, she has some feathers mixed in with her hair.*"Hm?" *She looks over*"Good. And if you're ever really in trouble, call me."*She nods and goes back to eating*[most people actually don't do random rolls anymore, it's fun to see them every now and again!]"Eep! Stop that please Mr.Kitten!" *She begins trying to wave him off with her wings*"Are you alright...?"[well, to be fair a lot of the time a character is randomized it doesn't turn out that well]since nobody has done personality, I will!

He enjoys entertaining people, but often does not realize when he takes jokes too far. For example, he thinks nothing of doing pranks that can actually be incredibly dangerous to everyone involved, like leaving cartoon bombs lying around. Still, he really does intend to make people happy and will try to make up for his mistakes"Hey! Don't even think about it!" *Her tail seems to have stuck out a bit more than usual in her distress, so there's also those giant feathers now**She looks rather surprised* "H-hey! No need to freak out so much about it, it's not like I could just leave my friend in danger.""You should probably go lie down somewhere..."*She nods*"Ow!" *She swings one of her wings towards the cat in a bit of a panic**She is currently waiting near the entrance for her father* "Hm? I'm fine...""Ditto." *She says with a smile*[good point!]"What do you need to find?""Uh..." *She obviously has no response to this*"Oh! Sorry!""I'm just... Not really hyped for this whole thing."*She nods and stands up. From this angle her face is easier to see, but it seem she is wearing a mask over it. She stands a good couple inches over 6'. She pulls a bit of her coat to the side, pointing to a nametag on the shirt below it that says LILITH*[I have not actually gotten a mod in here to RP up to that point and I don't entirely know how the powers exam works, so what should I do...?]"Seriously? Did you pull an all nighter or something last night?"[really? when? also an important note is that a duel on the ship would mean Lilith would be at an advantage, since speed would be less important in such an enclosed space]*She nods a greeting*"Hm? No, just waiting for someone."*Lilith seems to be busy gorging herself on various large fish*"Okay...?"*Dolly is currently waiting near the entrance to the school, she looks like she is waiting for someone*"I just got here, I don't know how to get anywhere.""Are you sure you can get there on your own?""Alright, rest up then.""Night." *Trish goes to polish and care for her sword*"How long of a walk is it?""Do you know anything about where you're going...?""You should probably get a police officer or someone to help you."[end..?]"Okay...?""I can't exactly help you then.""You look like you need to go to a hospital.""I'm about 90% sure that's not True."*Dolly lands just in front of the school and stretches her legs a bit, flying for a while makes them tired apparently**She holds up one of her wings to show her lack of hands* "Dolly. Nice to meet you.""Are you alright cat?"[not really, she knows it's a superpower school][alright, I'll leave it up to you then! I was mostly thinking that if you ever wanted a reason for her to join a team and couldn't think of another you could fall on her fighting Lilith and being impressed that one of the other people in the crew can do at least moderately well one-on-one with her, since one of her main complaints seemed to be that none of the leaders are tough enough]*She looks at him and nods**Lilith waves back, she looks happy*"Huh?" *She turns to him* "That's a bit of a blunt question.""And...? Being through something bad one time doesn't mean you should just ignore dangerous things from then on.""What?"*She nods*"I would tell you you *really* should be going to talk to a hospital.""Ya, I guess..."*She thinks for a bit, then shakes her head*"What, you've seen harpies?""...Those are real...?"*She sighs and thinks "at least this isn't my problem..."**She nods, and holds up a large harpoon lying beside her.*"What..?"[oops, sorry! I meant to say she shakes her head no]"Thanks..." *She doesn't seem to psyched for this*"You're an alien?"*She nods happily*"You dropped something.""My deal..?"*She nods, then stands up and begins sniffing the air, holding her harpoon*[ya, but Dolly figured she was just a mutant or something]*Well, she doesn't really have hands so there's not much she can do**She looks at the water, she seems to be focusing*"Seriously...?"*She thinks for a bit, then just gives a nod. She doesn't seem to talk much**She gives her a bemused look, holding up her large bright blue wings a bit*[alright then, end]*She is still eating, she sure eats a lot**She has no hands and no desire to pick up strange packages from crazy people*[okay!]*She suddenly throws the harpoon into the water, and after just a few seconds begins pulling the chain on it back in*"Well, that's... different...""Well, that's basically it. That and my legs of course, and my tail but that doesn't do much."*She pulls up another large fish**She sighs and mumbles to herself* "Great, I get to be the weak weird kid at superschool...""So... Why are you here?""Well... It doesn't look like you're limping or anything..."*She shrugs and hangs it over the fire*"Alright...""What?"*She thinks and then shrugs*"At least he has fingernails.""Okay..? Sorry if I'm weirding you out then."hello! I have a bit of a suggestion with the morality thing!

If we *do* implement it, a binary morality system would probably not be good. we should probably at least do a 2 axis ( some combination of evil/good, chaos/order, truth/ideals, or even some of the seven deadly sins and their corresponding virtues). Basically, in really good writing it's often hard or impossible to list an action accurately as just "evil" or "good", so trying to do so would cheapen the value of a lot of events. *She thinks, and shrugs again*"Alright. What's your name anyway?""I'm Dolly, Dolly Dove."*She tilts her head inquisitively* *She shrugs*"No, I can fly, I'm not an ostrich." "You don't have to be so scared."*She shrugs as well, and goes back to eating*"For what?"[end?]*She pulls her wing back* "That wasn't really an offer."*She sighs* "Do you always act like this?"*She thinks, then shrugs*"You really need to get more courage."*A tall figure in an obscuring coat is sweeping up what looks to be some debris on the ship's deck. The figure's back is turned, and between that, the coat, and their wide-brimmed hat, seeing their appearance is nigh impossible**Lilith walks into a circle near the middle, clicking off her chains and leaving them near the sidelines. She seems to want to train with someone*[ooc question! how strong is he exactly? like, raw lifting power?]except you don't need to have a clear-cut option for every morality, I figured that the morality system would be more like "we do a thing, we decide on the morality of the action afterwords".

Also, a lot of actions get really complicated on a 'heroic' and 'villainous' axis, like the bank robbery thingy going on right now.

On one hand, we are stealing (villainous), but on the other it is from people who got the money illegally anyway (heroic), but we are only doing it to support ourselves (villainous), but it will possibly weaken the gang (heroic), but the gang will likely lash out against innocents in retaliation (villainous), it's hard to list a single action as just "Heroic" or "Villainous"*She points to a nametag on her shirt that says LILITH*"Well ya, if it wasn't everyone would do it."[I meant in monster form]"How?"[okay!]in that case, I don't like the idea of a morality bar being implemented"Oh..." *"Awk-waaaard..." She thinks*"Alright...""Ya, kind of..." *She is examining her wing to make sure it's not too ruffled**She tilts her head, she seems a bit confused at this barrage of talking. She also doesn't seem to talk much**She thinks, then shakes her head no*[end?]*Lilith waves to her happily.**She begins writing, the notes says ONE QUESTION AT TIME PLEASE**Unfortunately, nobody seems very eager to fight Lilith. Instead she sits in the middle of the circle waiting**She tilts her head inquisitively and stands up, bringing her to her impressive full height**She scribbles another message NOT SURE, ASK KATJA* "I'm new, isn't that reason enough?"*She thinks, and then shrugs. At around that time, however, a large sea breeze blows over, blowing off Lilith's hat. Underneath she has a somewhat macabre mask, and from the few rips in it and the bit of her neck that is showing it can be seen that her skin underneath is solid jet black. Her hair also seems to be long thin spikes.*"Sure." *She says sarcastically**She nods, and looks a bit excited*"Well... My dad'll probably take a while to get here, but make it fast just in case."*She nods**Lilith just stands, and crosses her arms*"Nah, just hurry up."*The result barely even makes Lilith budge, it's like hitting a brick wall.*"I dunno, you're the one who knows this place not me."*I'm pretty sure that still means crazy...**Te figure turns towards him, the shadows cast by its hat obscure its face from this distance, but two dim red points of like seem to glow where its eyes would be*[end?]*Well, it doesn't seem malicious at the moment, it's just staring at him. In fact, it gives a small wave.**It doesn't work, but Lilith does calmly reach over to grab Katie by the shoulder**Lilith picks her up and calmly walks her to the edge of the circle before lightly pushing her out**It tilts its head inquisitively, but doesn't talk**It gives an odd growl-ish noise as a response**She nods*"Woohoo." *She says sarcastically*"Hm... Kitty, how about this-" *She brings her wing up near her mouth and plucks out one of her somewhat more ruffled feathers, dropping it in front of her near the cat and backing off* "There, a nice toy for you."*It shakes its head**Lilith nods, and this time just tries to pick Katie up again**She smiles, backing away and watching the cat play**It nods, and takes out a piece of paper and a pencil in its own pocket**Lilith grumbles a bit in annoyance as she tries rather clumsily to chase her**Lilith doesn't seem to be tiring any time soon, but she is looking annoyed**It scribbles a message with incredibly poor handwriting, it says LILITH*"You are a weird cat."wait, hives of bee-people exist in this setting? Also I don't think beehives are made from honey, I think they're made from beeswax, which is a separate thing worker bees make in their wax gland*Lilith suddenly seems to lose her temper for a moment, swinging her arm at full speed**She scribbles and writes DITTO**Lilith stops, looking a bit ashamed of what she just did. She glumly back out of the circle, forfeiting the match apparently**She nods**She points to what she's sweeping up, which upon closer inspection seems to be the remains of a bonfire.**Lilith gives a bit of an upset grumble**She nods**She takes out her pad of paper and begins to write, she writes DO NOT WANT TO HURT YOU**She seems a bit less upset now**She writes on her notepad IT WAS FUN**She nods**She shrugs**She shakes her head 'no'*I think it might be more interesting to have a javert-ish kind of character, who will pursue us regardless of our morality bar because we are still technically illegal vigilantes but will be more morally conflicted about it the more good we are*She huffs and goes to wait in the middle of the circle again**She happily waves back and goes back to waiting**She nods**She shakes her head**She nods, putting down her large broom*[oh! sorry! I responded to the wrong comment entirely! ignore that thing!]..?*She begins to walk below deck*[yes, but I'm not really sure how it's connected. it is an inside joke I don't know...?]*She begins writing LOTS OF THINGS**She writes a message DIFFERENT ROOMS FOR DIFFERENT SQUADS*oh! okay!*She shrugs*[oh yay! Also, to respond to your question from earlier about why, it's just usually best to get exact stats sorted out early so nobody ends up in arguments or confusion or anything about it later]*She thinks, then begins walking in a certain direction. Also, now that she is inside, she takes her hat off, revealing her jet black skin and spike-like hair*"I'm not really supposed to give many details."*She walks to the bridge of the ship**She nods*"I could be a normal kid if I couldn't."[end?][oh! okay! I like cute things like this]*She rolls her eyes* "That sounds original.""Nah, it's just a long story."*She points to the door to the bridge and writes a message for him SOME1 IN CHARGE PROBABLY KNOWS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO*well, there's still other possibilities for where her powers could be from, for example it could be a natural mutation like Akki's Oni powers, or the result of genetic manipulation like Dolly's wings! "As far as I know I'm not allergic to anything, so that's not a problem."I really agree, plus to make matters worse if you label choices as blatantly "good" and "evil" then people will be more inclined to pick based on their perceived morality of their character rather than based on what the choice actually is. If you say "you need to make money by either selling gear or by robbing a criminal organization", it can lead to interesting internal and external moral conflicts where characters of both traditionally "evil" and "good" alignments may pic either side, but once you label "selling your stuff gives you good points, stealing from the mob gives you evil points" a lot of the time people will just go for whichever one fits their character's "alignment".

Also, if you make the different options have different risks/rewards then it can lead to problems- if a certain path (good, evil, neutral) usually has highest reward or lowest risk people may pick that path just for the risk/reward ratio, but if you move the levels of risk and reward around some characters will end up with ambiguous moralities due to trying to keep the lowest risk or highest reward path. If you keep the risk/reward relatively the same you run into another problem, because if you have two paths of equal reward and risk then taking the evil one usually feels a bit cartoonish at best, like if your options for getting a cat out of a tree are "get food to lure  the cat down", "climb the tree and get the cat", or "shoot at the cat to scare it out of the tree", taking the evil option is just being bad for the sake of being bad at that point.What I meant by my first point is that without a morality system characters would have a fairly good chance of picking one or the other choice due to their character's more complex sense of right and wrong, for example maybe someone thinks stealing from criminals is okay but killing them is not, they might take the "evil" option here and a "good" option later. Reducing everyone's morality to just "good guy" and "bad guy" makes them feel shallow and cartoonish.

I didn't realize that it was just measuring the public opinion of people, but that makes it less bad

Selling equipment actually has far more risk in the long run, robbing the bank means doing one job fighting normal humans with full equipment, selling our equipment means every job from here on out will be harder

It wasn't meant as an insult, and I'm sorry if it sounded like it was. I'm just trying to point out that when all options are of relatively the same risk, reward, and difficulty, taking the evil one is just being bad for the sake of being bad. That's just the quickest example I could think of at the moment."Nope, I'm waiting on my dad to show up before I do entrance exams and stuff."*She shrugs*"Sure."okay, sorry that I misunderstood it then! I thought it was a "morality bar", but as a "reputation bar" it isn't that bad"Alright, lead the way."*Lilith was walking about, having little to do, when she finds the book. Due to her stronger senses, she can smell Katie's scent on it*it's okay! I am sorry if I sounded mean while criticizing it too, I'm not often very good at that*Indeed Lilith does, she begins trying to sniff around for Katie*"Thanks... Sorry if I'm being a bit of a pain right now.""Wouldn't be much point to them otherwise."[end?]"Ya."*Lilith walks up to her and taps her on the shoulder*"Do those even count as powers?""Or mutations."*Lilith hold the book out to her*"I wouldn't mind hearing it.""So, real superpowers.""Ya, I get it..."*She shrugs* "Never really put much thought to that.""Trust me, I know that already.""Dad's overprotective but he's basically said he'll support me as long as I'm not doing anything illegal.""Sure..." *She sounds a bit annoyed*"Intended but not appreciated."*She takes out her pad of paper, placing the notebook down, and begins writing a response- ON FLOOR*"I guess... I just didn't expect to have to move across the country"*She shakes her head*oh! I cannot wait to see more about the squad home making thing!*She nods happily**She reads it, but looks confused. She ends up just shrugging.**She nods**She nods**She nods and dumps the entire cup of sugar in, or at least as much as will fit without making it spill**She writes a message I LIKE SUGAR*[oh! thank you!]

*Lilith nods**Lilith lifts her mask and pours the sugary slurry down her throat**In the gym, Dolly walks in. Rather than being here to try fighting, she seems to actually just be here to exercise. She picks up a few large weights with her talons and begins flying around*"This is my first time leaving my hometown.""New Cascadia""Great."*She sighs* "The weather was great, the food was great, the people were nice, everything looked fancy and new. It was great." *She looks a bit sad*"...Can we stop talking about it?""What grades learn here again?"*She is managing to fly with some fairly impressive weights, each of the dumbbells is about 75 pounds*"Huh?" *She turns her head towards her as she flies*"Oh, hi." *She sounds a bit out of breath**She lands* "What do you mean?""And what do you guess I do?""Alright...?""I'm Dolly, by the way, Dolly Dove.""So... Any particular reason you have guards?""Why not?""Wow.""What?!""Sounds kinda cool...""And you're still in school...?""ya..." *She looks obviously uncomfortable*[end?]"So long.""Do you live in the dorms?"*She nods*"Sounds fun."Thursday QOTD please!*Lilith tilts her head and writes something down WHAT'S FUNNY?**BUT IT'S SWEET**WHY NOT?*[ooc question! so people on one of the two squads count as being on the other one too?]ooc: okay! Lilith can't join though unfortunately, since she's on another squad"How so?"*THAT SOUNDS FAKE*"Like batman stuff?"*I DO THIS ALOT**It's worth noting that Lilith eats an amazing amount at every meal time*"Would that even work? Wouldn't the balance be all messed up or something?""Couldn't you just say no?"*Someone knocks on the door to Mason's garage**From an alley nearby Wallace, a scream can be heard*[question! what does Professor Delvanis teach?]"Is that common in this city?"*In the alley is a somewhat comical and unsuspected sight. The person who screamed was a skimask-wearing thug, who despite his size sounded like a little girl when he screamed. He was doing this, apparently, because at the moment he is being held upside-down by his ankle by a woman with bright red hair and silver armor.**An odd sight is there, a man in a white motorcycle helmet and a white coat, his clothes are too thick to be comfortable in this weather* "Sup, I heard you make bikes?"[oh, okay!]*Trish, in her usual civilian getup, walks by and says without looking at her* "If you don't like it go replace them, most people won't care."*She nods and writes HUNGRY**He walks in* "Ah, nice to know I got the address right. I was wondering if you could make a bike for me."*The man seems to be apologizing and begging to be put down, while the woman sounds like she's scolding him*

"Stealing is wrong, don't you know that?""Good, I was worried I would have to avoid gunfights and cardgames on motorcycles."*She shrugs*"Flashy, heroic, hopefully kind of resistant to bullets."*She turns towards him and gives a small friendly wave and a smile* "Hello there! Isn't it such a great day out?""No crap, people don't join a gang because they're strong, they join a gang because they're desperate."*She shrugs* "You never know.""Hm? Oh, him? It's okay, he's a bad person!""Skoll, it's great to meet you." *He holds out his hand for a handshake*I like the ideas of these characters, also welcome to the sub! Also, I'm not a mod but I have a few suggestions! 

firstly, it would probably be best to put some exact numbers to her powers, like how far she can flash step, the danger score of her hand seals, how long she can shapeshift, etc! For reference, it's usually best to include a few basic things about a power: How dangerous/powerful it is (danger score, length for teleports, increase for buff spells, etc), how often it can be used, and how many times it can be used! also in some cases how long it lasts or how long it takes to do it.

on a similar note, you should probably say an exact score for her chainmail's durability! 

also, you don't have to, but a trained 17 year old can easily have a 2 strength instead of a 1! And danger score normally incorporates a character's weaponry too, a person with a sword can normally hurt a durability 4 character

most of these apply to ana too, and again welcome to the sub!*She nods happily*"At home, dad's way to protective to leave me somewhere like here.""Your side?""Of course. It's easy and a good way to get rich and stay alive, otherwise it's dirty dangerous work.""Hm... Not really, I don't need anything too special."no problem! I like helping new people!"I can make it back on my own.""Oh! Of course!""I'm not too experienced with bikes so I'll leave most of the details to you, only things that it really needs are to be able to handle a good bit of weight and to be white and silver."*She shoves them all in her mouth and chews happily**She nods*"Lots of stuff, mostly carrying people  and swords and other melee weaponry."*She looks longingly at the box*"Why?""You too." *She suddenly flaps her wings, taking off at high speed and doing a small flight back towards the entrance*[indeed!]"Oh ya, that's what they normally do.""Jack shit, all it says is they're smart or charismatic enough to get stupid or scared people to do work for them and they're not skilled enough to do so with something less risky.""Cool."*She puts him down and sighs a bit sadly*"Hm... That might be a problem. ""This used to be a lot more fun.""Ya, I used to get to hit them a lot more.""Well, I don't exactly have a cellphone.""You do know you're talking to a costumed hero, right?"*She pouts a bit* "I miss the god old days sometimes.""Never said that, but I know that everyone who knows anything about me personally is a potential target for anyone who wants to get to me, I don't want to take a chance like that.""Why would I do something different?"*Lilith goes over to the couch and considers sitting on it, but luckily realizes that this would likely break it in half. She instead sits next to it to watch everyone else play*[question! do the squads that don't have an official area yet sleep here for the time being?]"Like I said, feel free to stop them, most of the city won't care, to them one crime boss is the same as any other.""Cool power. Still, it doesn't make you unbeatable."*Lilith is currently trying to tip over the soda machine to get sodas to fall out*[ooc: oh! oops! disregard that then, I thought you meant one of [these](https://www.webuypinball.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coke-and-pepsi-vending-machines-modern.jpeg) kinds of soda machines!]"Well, sorry to hear that.""Don't worry, someone else will the second you leave.""White and silver actually. Some blue highlights would look good though, in hindsight."yay!"Also, before you get started, any idea how much this will cost?""It does happen, sometimes. Problem is that anyone like that is bound to get killed eventually and replaced, and chances are better that some cowardly fuck will take over next.""Alright.""I'll give you one of a friend of mine, just call him and tell him that you want to talk to Skoll. He'll let me know." *He starts writing a number*"Sure, it was great meeting you by the way.""Word of advice, at least 90% of the people on the planet just want to stay alive, not much more."[end?]*She shrugs* "It works for them."*She smiles and begins to eat happily* *Lilith, in between mouthfuls of cookies, writes one message NO WATER**Lilith looks almost distressed as she decides which foods to eat, but eventually just starts piling on many different foods onto a plate*[I can't really join the squad, but I do know a fair bit about colors! with a name like jesters I'm guessing you want somewhat whimsical color schemes?]*While Katie seems friendly, a certain... individual who was sitting next to her looks a fair bit less so. Who or whatever that is seems to be a large vaguely feminine individual with pure black skin and spike-like hair who had previously been occupying herself with eating a massive meal. When he enters and Katie walks up to him, however, she looks over, sniffing the air and tilting her head inquisitively* *She writes NOT WHAT I MEANT**She nods**She takes out a pad of paper and begins writing with rather sloppy penmanship, she writes one word- NEW**She nods**She writes IN BASE NO WATER PLEASE NONE NEAR BASE EITHER PLEASE**She points to a nametag on her shirt- which happens to looks oddly like an old-fashioned prison uniform- which says LILITH**She writes again NO I DO NOT LIKE WATER. ONLY LITTLE WATER, BIG WATER IS BAD**She looks happy, and suddenly hugs her**She lets go and scribbles a note, it reads I LIKE FOOD, YOU ARE GETTING ME FOOD ALSO YOU ARE MY FRIEND**She huffs and writes a message. She shows the message which says LITTLE WATER, YES while pointing to a nearby tap and to a cup of water. She then stands and begins walking out, beckoning for Katie to follow**She goes on deck, writing a message along the way. Once up there, she points to the ocean and writes BIG WATER, BAD* *Lilith seems generally happy**She shrugs. However, given her appearance, the fact that she has powers is obvious. She writes a message BIG, STRONG, TOUGH, STUFF. ASK KATIE.**Though her mask hides it, Lilith's face looks somewhat suspicious of him as he goes**In an alley, a pair of screams can be heard**She nods and writes THAT IS GOOD**She nods, but writes NEED TO GET OUTFIT FIRST**WAIT ON DECK, I WILL BE RIGHT UP**She nods*[okay!]*In a few minutes, Lilith comes up. She has a large coat and wide-brimmed hat, as well as gloves and boots. Together with her mask her appearance is virtually impossible to see under all of that**Lilith nods and follows**She looks rather excited, and she begins pointing out quite a few different kinds**Lilith looks a bit confused**Lilith nods in agreement with what Katie says**Lilith catches and quickly eats it**Lilith tilts her head a bit inquisitively**She nods**Upon hearing that Katie needs help, Lilith shoots up and runs over. She seems to be volunteering**She writes a message NEED HELP?**Lilith seems to be a bit wary, but happy to be here**Lilith nods, and begins to make her way back**I CAN HANDLE PROBABLY**She thinks for a bit, then shrugs.**She shakes her head. She seems to be much more uneasy on the dock, though**I WANT TO HELP**She writes a message quickly WHERE**She nods and quickly and carefully makes her way onto the ship**As soon as Lilith is away from the water she calms down**Lilith nods*

[okay! do you want to post it or should I?][end here for now then?]*She shrugs**She writes a message- MILK*[oh! okay! I will comment there!]*Lilith wanders in shortly, looking happy to be helping**Lilith looks happy**Lilith nods**She presses down hard onto her arm, bending the blade a bit and making a small papercut-sized slice. However, the second this cut is made, her blood begins firing out at high pressure, like a cracked pipe**Lilith dips her cookies in milk and eats happily**She tilts her head inquisitively* *She shrugs. Katie might want to hurry, that blood is certainly going quickly**Lilith finishes her cookies and gulps down the last of her milk*[okay! your best bet would be going for some variant of the primary colors and their opposites (red with green, blue with orange, and purple with yellow). An important thing to remember with these though is that it is often as if not more aesthetically pleasing to shift one of the colors one color away, for example exchanging yellow with green or orange, red with orange or purple, and blue with green or purple! secondly, hot colors (red, orange, and yellow) convey varying levels of excitement and activity, such as aggression for red and happiness for yellow, while cool colors (blue, green, purple) convey more subdued feelings like contentment and calm! this can also be affected with brightness and saturation, brighter colors seem more 'active', while duller darker ones seem more passive, and less saturated colors often have a lesser effect than more saturated ones around them! So, with all that in mind, one possibility for what to use for your color scheme would be using yellow (associated with happiness and excitement) and blue (shifted from purple by one, represents calm or relaxed nature), making both colors bright and the yellow more saturated while the blue is somewhat less so, giving an overall kind of "relaxed and cheery" air to the color scheme!]*Inside is an odd scene, a man in a skimask and a woman have just started running screaming from what looks like a female oni**The oni turns to them and looks... kind of spooked actually* "Eep!" *It's worth noting that she seems to be holding the purse of the woman who ran off**She begins writing WHY NOT?**Lilith, in the meantime, has begun wandering the kitchen**She shrugs and writes I ALWAYS BLEED LIKE THAT* "W-what? What did you just do?" *She looks confused by this whole situation**She shakes her head*"What? Wait, I wasn't!" *She looks scared**Eventually Lilith seems to just wander off**She writes PROBABLY**She nods quickly, looking rather upset by now**Lilith quickly runs back to the room, tilting her head inquisitively* *She holds up the PROBABLY page again. This time, however, she decides not to bend the knife again and just bites her arm, leaving four small bleeding puncture points**She shrugs*[your welcome! sorry that the comment was so long!]*She writes a message DID YOU NEED ANYTHING?**She waits, she seems to not be very affected by the pain*"Why is being a hero so hard?" *She says, sounding rather sad*[not really, I just really like colors and I remember weird thingies like that sometimes!][oh! thank you I think!]"H-huh?" *She looks surprised and a bit embarrassed by the sudden hug* "U-um thanks...""Oh! ya, sorry..." *She hands it over* "People run a lot when I try to help them...""Who are you exactly?""Ninjas still exist...?""And you really use magic and stuff? This is just like an anime...""Eep! Sorry!" *She looks rather intimidated despite her large size**Lilith, smelling blood in the air, goes to investigate*"Sorry about that..."[as an OOC note, if this is happening at the same time as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiHeroRP/comments/3ni6bb/training_area/cvp6e2k) whole interaction then Kiro might be interested]*She still looks a bit spooked*[it's okay!]"W-well everyone calls me Oni..."*Lilith looks over and calmly waves. She doesn't seem very upset about the situation.*"I guess?""Th-thank you for not trying to stab me...""Well, lots of people have tried it."*Lilith shrugs in response*"Well, they didn't succeed at least, but I've had to get a lot of new shirts."*She doesn't have both hands free so she can't write a response, which greatly annoys her*"It is! I liked those shirts!" *She pouts*"Oh! That could be fun!" *She smiles a bit, but it quickly fades* "But... I can't really do it looking like this...""I don't think a disguise would really work with me."*She lets out a low annoyed growl**Her growl gets a bit deeper*"I-it's alright, you don't have to!""W-we're friends now?!""Alright...?" "O-oh! It was nice meeting you too!" "What kind of cool stuff?""Not really, I'm just... Big and strong I guess.""It's okay! I can't do that!" *She says reassuringly**She winces for a second or two, but then seems fine again**She shrugs and wanders off again*[end?]*She seems to be paying attention to other things in the room*@LilacLeopard

Jesus can we not go ten minutes without another big story about a criminal? We're in Totenburg, it's not really "new". Then again not like

@LilacLeopard

fucking character limits why is that a thing
[I'm not sure if I'm going to continue those simply because so many events end without any real sign and also since a lot of her internal things will end up being pretty repetitive] *Lilith sniffs at the wound a bit**Lilith taps her on the shoulder, a slightly concerned look on her face though it is hidden by her mask*[yep. I am still keeping track of the things in her head though!]@LilacLeopard

I've got nothing against you I just don't get why the media is blowing up over this. Bank robberies are basically just Tuesday for this tow

@LilacLeopard

Town. god this site is annoying. *Lilith huffs in annoyance, and then headbutts her*@LilacLeopard

Welp, good luck with all that.*Lilith is currently licking her wound, as she does so the bleeding scabs over quickly**She shrugs, but she is certainly bleeding and seems to be standing a bit less steadily**Lilith laps up some of the excess blood on her arm, then sits down, looking tired**Lilith slowly writes a message on her notepad, which seems to have gotten some blood on it. The message just says HUNGRY**She stands slowly, following rather sluggishly*@LilacLeopard

What?*She shrugs and begins eating*@LilacLeopard

well, good to know people in Totenburg have no life as usual

*Meanwhile, in real life, She begins to make her way towards the church**She sees him* "Didn't I meet you in the hospital or something?"*She tilts her head inquisitively*"Who?" *She seems to have not remembered him much**She thinks then shakes her head**Lilith seems to be a bit busy eating.**Lilith nods and goes to raid the fridge**Lilith, meanwhile, is more happy to have some food and rest*"I meant the brother, I remember Saul.""Ya, not ringing any bells."*The kitchen may not survive. Also, the training room is still covered in blood*"Then why the fuck did you bring him up?""So, do you always forget things [that happened less than a minute ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3nn03s/totenrider/cvqdnqh) or is talking to me a special case?"[I am in the squad! yay!]"Don't dodge the question, it's annoying.""No you didn't. Also, I'm busy." *She keeps walking**She rolls her eyes* Well, at least I was right about the person planning it being a fucking idiot.""No, you're just stupid. You forgot something that happened less than a minute ago then failed to answer a basic question and lied about it, saying it was some mysterious bullshit."*Lilith sits by, watching quietly. Given her general nature there's no way of telling if she understands anything she's watching*"Sure." *She says with a chuckle**Hati walks by, she doesn't seem to be bothered much by the nudity and waves as she passes* "Hello Johnny!"*Surprisingly, Trish shows up. She is known for trying to stay out of the battles of the various gangs, so if she's here she probably has a reason*"So, what's your plan oh wise one?""Let me guess, you thought that sounded cool?"[ooc, I mean like... A minute or two with a hose covered. it's pretty bad.]

*Lilith seems content to move very little in her current anemic state*"Please, it gets worse when you lie about it afterwords.""Ya, I usually try to keep it that way. Heard you guys where going to kill some gangs.""Where are all your clothes?"

[also, she knows 4, not this one, right? not that she knows the difference. Actually IIRC she doesn't even know there's more than one.]*Lilith writes a message, STRONGER BEDS. To demonstrate she puts some weight on one of the beds, causing it to creak under her.*"Why?"[oh! sorry! in the OOC one I was refering to how much blood was in the training room now, due to Lilith's high pressure blood it would be a large amount. In my IC one I was saying that Lilith wouldn't be moving much for a while due to her current lack of a lot of her blood]*She nods and plops down on the floor on some sheets she pulled off a bed**She thinks, then writes a message SOMEWHERE TO NAP**Lilith takes a large smoked ham from the fridge with her and lays on the bed happily.*[end?]"What kind of stuff? Also are you not depressed anymore now?""Why were you drinking yourself into unconsciousness about being dumped then?" *She says, sounding honestly confused*"Do you actually listen to what other people are saying to you or do you just have one-sided conversations and fill in the dialogue with whatever you like at the moment?""Huh...?"*Lilith smiles happily*"Got it. I have one request though.""I know a girl who thinks she has a gang, she's a handful but she's harmless. Her name's Nightshade. Just leave her out of this whole thing."*She looks incredibly confused now, it seems to be hurting her head**She sighs* "I won't lie about the fact that she's a fucking idiot, but I'm not going to let her die here. The rest of her gang can go burn for all I care.""My head hurts now...""And I'll get her out. I told her it was a shitty plan too.""I don't think so...?""Then I'll make sure you don't see her.""Why would I be dying?" "Hm?""Got it, you made that pretty clear." *She turns to leave*"Oh! Why?""Really? How come you never said it earlier?" *She then makes her way to Nightshade's church*

/u/mikailgirl"Why not?""Eh?" *She is back to looking confused*"But we talked and stuff a while ago."OOC:

On the sub or in general? In general my favorite hero is probably superman or captain america! My favorite villain is probably Harley Quinn but only some of the versions of her, or if we can pick a pair then Dee Dee!

I think the worst power to have would probably be self-vaporization but without de-vaporization. A unique power... The ability to make people see themselves as you see them temporarily? like a reverse empathy? "There's more of you?"[oh! forgot the IC portion!]

*Lilith takes out her paper and writes a short message to answer LESS WEIGHT*"Ooooooooh. That explains a lot. I think. Maybe. What day is it actually?""This is confusing me too much" *She actually seems to have a bit of steam coming out of her head*"Wait, but... Dead? And things?" *She looks incredibly confused, she is apparently still working things out* "So... Which Johnny is Johnny then?""Are those different?""Ya, pretty much what I thought."*She keeps walking*"Then who'se real?" "Tiger lady?" *She says, mostly to herself, as she walks*[as an OOC note, how did he know that?][okay, just a lucky guess. I thought he actually knew about her father, which to be fair isn't impossible if he knew enough about her to know who her father supposedly is. Also, I do not know that song, would the reference make more sense if I heard it?]"...Am *I* real...?""What if I'm another Hati?""But what iiiiiiif!" *She looks panicked*"Wait, I'm Fine, not Hati? What is this?!""Hm?""Oh! Right! But aren't you a different Johnny?""Oh. Where's the real Johnny?""Ya, the pervert."*Trish makes her way in* "Nightshade, we gotta hurry.""Saving your life, now grab anything important quickly.""I'll make it simple, there are people who are pissed at you and your gang, there are a lot of them. If they see you, will will die a slow and painful death.""She's wiping the place clean before she does it, and that includes you.""Best choice would be out of the city, I've got the cash to get us basically anywhere else in the country.""You sure? This is probably going to be your only chance to grab things.""Can you walk like that?""We'll get you some medicine on the way.""I can afford it, don't worry. Now follow me.""You won't be able to do that for a long time, maybe not ever.""Did you somehow miss the part about people trying to kill you?" "Plenty of people in this little lynch mob are going to be staying here. They'll still be gunning for you.""Do you want to risk it?"*She smiles a bit and jokingly says* "Ya, you can be a handful otherwise. Now quick, get on my bike." *She walks outside to her motorcycle**Lilith seems set on just walking in a straight line. She sniffs the air for anything interesting in the area as well*"Hold on, I'm going to be going pretty fast.""Alright, just... Alright, you ride in front so you won't fall off.""I'm good at it."*Trish drives off to her motel room* "Just need to grab some things."*She goes inside, quickly grabbing her guitar case which she prepared by filling it with her cash, spare clothes, and general supplies. She then goes to check on Nightshade, also bringing a jacket for her**As she walks she smells something sweet completely off the path, and wanders off for a bit. When she returns calmly to the path shortly afterwords, she is surrounded by a swarm of angry bees who thankfully cannot pierce her skin. They seem upset about her taking their entire hive and occasionally eating some honey out of it.**She seems to barely even notice them, and gives a friendly wave. Unfortunately for him the bees are still buzzing around angerly in this general area, following her and their hive**She shrugs and begins calmly walking down the path*"Shit... Put this on, quick." *She hands her the jacket and goes to grab a blanket**She comes back and wraps the blanket around her before getting on the bike and starting it up*"Hold on, I'll find somewhere." *She keeps driving, and passes a pharmacy. She screeches the bike to a halt* "One sec." *She jumps off, pulls her hat low, and runs to the store**Trish runs out shortly, holding a bottle of what looks like cold medicine. The owner is chasing her, but she tosses a handful of cash in his face. She gets on the bike, trying to sidestep the vomit, and gets moving again. She begins trying to work off the cap of the medicine with one hand* "You alright? Still awake?"*She pops the cap off and it rolls down the road* "Shit... Just take some of this, carefully.""Nightshade I will pull this bike over and force it down your throat if I have to." *She holds it closer to Nightshade's mouth* "It'll make you feel better, trust me.""Sorry about the taste. I promise I'll buy whatever meal you want to make up for it, sound fair?""Not really, sorry."*Lilith looks at the sandwich silently for a few moments. Then, she lays her head on the table. She seems to be crying.**On her way back from the kitchen, she might notice that the doors to one of the bathrooms are wide open. Inside, Lilith is sitting with her back to the door, her mask is on the ground beside her**She sighs* "I know you want to. That doesn't make it a good plan.""Nearest motel, you need somewhere to sleep."*Lilith also has a large beehive stuck on her hand, which she occasionally eats some honey from. She doesn't apparently mind the swarm of bees trying to sting her, since they can't penetrate her skin*"You feeling any better? Is the medicine working yet?" *As she drives a light can be seen in the distance**Her hands under the table write a message on her notepad. She holds it up, it says NOT ENOUGH FOOD*"Now's really not the time to be thinking about flowers."*She looks at him in confusion*"I'll go back for them but for now we need to get you somewhere safe.""Sorry if I'm being overprotective.""Well I haven't gotten to the point of chewing your food for you at least.""If it seriously comes to that point I'm just getting you to a hospital." *She says with a small smile* "Even I've got limits."*Lilith seems to barely notice her, she's holding something in her hand- it looks like a large chunk of one of the mirrors from one of the other bathrooms. She is studying her own face, revealed in full possible for the first time since she was kidnapped. Surprisingly, other than its coloration and the small scar from her fight with Oni, it looks like the face of a normal girl.**Lilith jerks to attention, putting on her mask and turning to Katie*"Alright." *Just in time, the sign of a motel can be seen.* "Perfecto."*She gives a small wave, even she can tell something is wrong*"Sure." *She gets off the bike and carefully picks Nightshade up.**She thinks for a while, then shrugs. She pulls out her notepad and writes ARE YOU OKAY?*"Trust me, you're not that bad." *She says, deciding to hold her in a fireman's carry* "That alright or do you want me to carry you differently?"[ooc: wow, his parents really overreacted, I feel bad for him!]*Lilith's shoulders sag a bit, she looks a bit upset now*"Alright, hold on, we'll be inside soon." *She walks past the register, tossing a wad of cash and grabbing a key before the confused attendant can react. She makes her way to the door to their new room and walks in, laying Nightshade on the bed**Lillith looks surprised, and then rather angry. She clenches her fists, her knuckles cracking loudly**From the growling it seems that Lilith is still rather upset with the situation**Lilith likely heard, and she seems to calm down a bit. She isn't quite sure what to do, but after a few seconds she tries to comfort Katie with a hug**From nearby, the familiar heavy stomps of Lilith can be heard, accompanied by a large amount of angry buzzing**Lilith holds her quietly**Lilith steps into view, looking surprisingly chipper given her current state. Namely, she currently has a mostly broken beartrap stuck on one leg, unable to pierce her skin, and a full beehive on one of her hands. The buzzing is the sound of a large number of bees angerly attempting and failing to sting her as she casually occasionally sips honey from the hive. She sees Katie and waves with her hive-covered hand.**Lilith shakes her head**Lilith shrugs and eats some more honey. She doesn't seem to be taking this very seriously, most likely because none of the traps really present a threat to her.**Lilith's hands are busy with hugging at the moment, so she can't write a response**Lilith begins looking at the humanpaper trap, she seems to be thinking. A few bees get stuck in the paper as well**Lilith holds her, trying to think of anything to help, and suddenly something unexpected occurs. Starting low, barely perceptible, but quickly gaining in volume, she hums. Not a growl or roar as usual, but a normal calming hummed tune.**Lilith hums a short tune, then lets Katie go to write a message- KATIE IS NOT A MONSTER. KATIE IS NICE. KATIE IS GENTLE. KATIE WAS SCARED.**She puts down her hive and begins ripping the bottom of the tree apart**Lilith seems a bit happier. She writes NO PROBLEM**She nods and carefully begins pulling the weakened tree back, snapping the last of it and gently laying it on the ground with Katie on top. She begins ripping up the bark the paper is attached to**Lilith writes another message I AM SORRY I WAS NOT THERE**Lilith gives her a thumbs-up and picks up the hive again, enjoying some more honey**She still looks a bit ashamed that she couldn't help**Lilith seems to be barely following the path, mostly investigating sweet smells and interesting things, including finding another hive of bees**She writes a message I CAN HELP KEEP YOU SAFE FROM NOW ON**The sound of a treetrunk trap being tripped by Lilith can be heard, and as it swings at her she responds by swinging a punch at it and cracking the log down the middle**Lilith thinks, and then nods in agreement. She also starts sniffing the air, and then digging at the ground. She comes up with a handful of truffles**She looks a bit disappointed**Lilith shrugs and takes them with her**Lilith writes a message STAY SAFE*[yep! that was fun!]*She pats her on the head**She looks over at it and shrugs. Still, it had to have come from one of the bathrooms, so they're probably going to need a new mirror somewhere soon**She thinks for a bit, and then shrugs**She nods**She begins sniffing the air and walking**A loud clinking can be heard coming back down the hall shortly afterwords**She puts a trashbin in front of her* "If you puke the medicine up you'll just need to take more, you know."*She sighs and takes the bottle out of her jacket**She places the large number of bottles she retrieved on the ground and then shrugs**Lilith sniffs one of the bottle and shudders, putting it back down**Lilith shrugs, then begins looking at the bottles and at the sink and thinking**Lilith begins taking the caps off of bottles and pouring them down the drain**Trish sighs* "Nightshade, you're too old to be acting like this.""I'm not worrying too much, I just want you to take your medicine."*She puts them down and writes a message SMELLS BAD, TASTES BAD, DON'T WANT IT*"It's medicine, it'll help."*She writes WHY?*"Seriously? You're always talking about how mature you are and now you don't even want to take your medicine?"*She writes THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BAD PLAN**She holds it up to her lips* "Alright, drink some. Try not to cough."*Lilith keeps pouring out bottles**She pours some in her mouth**Lilith looks at her with a somewhat worried face, and begins trying to take bottles from her**She pulls it back* "Swallow it, it won't do you any good if you just spit your medicine out."*Lilith tries to take this one**She puts it down out of reach and says THIS STUFF SMELLS BAD, I THINK IT IS BAD FOR YOU*"There. Now sleep, I'll keep watch for anyone who might have followed us." *She pulls the blankets up further over Nightshade**Lilith sniffs her and looks worried**Trish smiles and, as she promised, starts keeping watch**She writes WHY**She writes again BUT WHY**She huffs in annoyance and writes I MEAN WHY DO YOU DRINK IT*[well, Trish intends on helping her find somewhere else to live eventually, but we can do that later if you like!]*She writes WHY IS FORGETTING GOOD. It's worth remembering that Lilith is a total amnesiac of anything that happened before her kidnapping**She tilts her head a bit, but accepts the answer*[okay!]*Lilith does not know the difference between any of these and just starts pouring soup down her throat**She pts down a large bowl she was drinking from and waves at him**She takes out her pad of paper and writes GOOD. WHY ARE YOU WRITING?**She tilts her head in confusion**She shrugs*[I am from a different squad, but I helped the other squads pick some color things too! want some help?][okay! I did a color analysis rundown thingy elsewhere, but I can copy/paste it here!]

&gt;[okay! your best bet would be going for some variant of the primary colors and their opposites (red with green, blue with orange, and purple with yellow). An important thing to remember with these though is that it is often as if not more aesthetically pleasing to shift one of the colors one color away, for example exchanging yellow with green or orange, red with orange or purple, and blue with green or purple! secondly, hot colors (red, orange, and yellow) convey varying levels of excitement and activity, such as aggression for red and happiness for yellow, while cool colors (blue, green, purple) convey more subdued feelings like contentment and calm! this can also be affected with brightness and saturation, brighter colors seem more 'active', while duller darker ones seem more passive, and less saturated colors often have a lesser effect than more saturated ones around them!

[there! so that can help, or if you know what kind of theme of feeling you want the colors to convey I can try to help you make one!][okay! feel free to ask questions!][well, passion is best represented with warm colors (red, yellow, orange) so picking one of those as a background color would be best! also, make sure to have it be very saturated rather than a light or faded one, saturated colors seem more powerful. It would probably be best to have a cool color for your secondary (text) color, since those would contrast best. Now, my personal input- choosing red as your primary could get very confusing since it's already the feral flare's primary, same goes (to a much lesser extent) for orange, so I would suggest Yellow or Orange as your primary color! now, for Yellow the usual opposite color would be purple which would make it a good text choice color, but Purple/Yellow is the Jesters' color scheme and inverting it may get confusing or seem tacky. Luckily, shifting the color one way or the other is a great option, leaving you with red or blue! Red runs into the same problem with the flares, but a deep blue and yellow pattern gives a [distinct courageous appearance](http://media.merchantcircle.com/4235351/Blue%20Fleur%20de%20Lis%20Shield%20with%20Gold%20Fighting%20Lion%20Use%20this%20one_full.png). You could also go for an orange background, which would pair with Blue (or shifted to green or purple). Orange and purple would likely be too close to the jesters' colors, but Orange and [Blue](https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2014/04/02/11/11/shield-305476_640.png) or [Green](http://pre13.deviantart.net/b535/th/pre/i/2014/362/4/0/orange_and_green_shield_by_britannialoyalist-d8bfig5.png) would both be good options. You could also substitute in a bright yellow-ish green instead of a traditional warm color as your main color, the opposite of which would be red (shifted to orange or purple). Personally I think Purple and green looks good, but it's up to you!]*Lilith, surprisingly, votes for doing a favor for Mainframe*indeed! I like it too, it reminds me of a knight!*Lilith writes a message on her pad of paper THERE IS ONE OF HER AND LOTS MORE THAN ONE OF US**Lilith writes back NO, BUT WE CAN BRING HER TO POLICE. ALSO WHY ARE YOU WRITING?**Akki is stepping out of an alley, having just stopped another mugging. She is still in her oni form, luckily.*"Eep!" *Akki was not expecting that, and jumped a bit in surprise*[ooc: she was, but only because Lilith is mute.]

*Lilith writes a message back IT IS OKAY*"Fine I guess. I didn't really expect to run into you again so soon.""Huh? Where?""S-spiders?" *She sounds scared*"Huh...? Is this a recruitment..?""Killing?!""You shouldn't kill people!"[okay then! I think blue in general just goes very well with bright yellow-ish colors like yellow-green and light orange]*Lilith waves happily, putting her large bowl down*"That doesn't make it okay!"*Lilith has no way of telling this, but returns to pouring out some of the other bottles**She gives a somewhat sad huff and nods**She nods and writes SLEEP WELL*"Actually you kind of just did..."*She thinks, then shakes her head**Lilith wanders off to the kitchen**She writes IT IS OKAY**She writes VERY GOOD**She writes HOW IS YOUR SQUAD?*[indeed]*She tilts her head inquisitively**She still looks inquisitive**She shrugs**She nods**She nods excitedly at that prospect**She continues pouring large amounts of soup down her throat*[on an unrelated note, I am happy that so many people seem to like lilith so far!][i'm not sure, but it's good to see that people like her.][ooc it's okay!]

*Lilith writes IT'S OKAY*okay! not a mod, but one big thing I have to bring up is that there doesn't really seem to be a way to fight her in energy form from the sound of it. She is intangible so no kinetic attack can hit her, and any energy-based attack would just be absorbedhow does a mystery event work?oh! okay! I will sign up if there's still slots open, it sounds fun!yay!I will do the Tuesday meal if that is okay with everyone![oh yay! I can't wait to see who gets picked!]*Lilith is in the Feral Flares' home area, she smells slightly of alcohol* *Lilith looks over with a confused tilt of her head. She writes a message on a piece of paper and shows it to him, it says HOW..?* *She shakes her head, then writes a message that says I POURED A LOT OF IT OUT**She writes IT SMELLED BAD AND TASTED BAD**She lightly pushes him away, but given her powers a light push is probably rather powerful. She writes a message that says HOW DO I KNOW WHICH STUFF IS CHEAP**She shrugs, she also looks a bit sad now**Lilith quietly, or at least as quietly as a woman with the weight of a car can, walks off to go be alone somewhere*[ooc, Lilith gets sad easily when people she thinks of as her friends are mad at her] [oh yay!][okay!][he looks like he might be too powerful, but other than that looks interesting!][yay! I like gentle characters with a lot of power][I dunno, but some people seem to not for some reason]*Lilith is slowly eating some BLTs, she looks a bit sad*[ooc, Lilith is a strange case. She's probably True neutral or chaotic neutral]

*Lilith thinks for a while, the shrugs, writing a message that says I LIKE FORGIVING PEOPLE**She writes a message PEOPLE ARE MAD AT ME**She writes SOMETHING ABOUT POURING OUT ALCOHOL**She writes REALLY?* *She writes THANK YOU**She goes back to eating**Lilith seems a bit happier**She nods and writes DITTO**She writes a message that says PAYLOAD IS MAD AT ME**She shrugs**She shrugs**She looks confused, then seems to realize something. She writes I DIDN'T MEAN DITTO LIKE THE PERSON DITTO**She writes DITTO LIKE- DITTO? IS THAT A WORD?**She writes I POURED OUT A LOT OF ALCOHOL**She shrugs*[ooc, it actually is a word that basically just means "same". when Katie said "Heyy, if someone ever picks on you, just let me know." Lilith said 'ditto' as in 'same to you']

*Lilith looks confused now**She writes HE SOUNDED MAD**She writes I ALSO MIGHT HAVE BROKEN ONE OF HIS BONES AGAIN ON ACCIDENT**HE SEEMS TO BE MAD AT KATIE NOW TOO**Lilith nods happily*

[it's okay!]*She writes hurriedly I DO NOT WANT TO START FIGHTS**She tilts her head, looking confused now**She writes GERMAIN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TEACHING PAYLOAD**She shrugs, it seems she's just going to leave him to hsi own devices with that*[oh my! that sounds like it might go bad]*She waves goodbye*[yep!][indeed, it will go bad but also will be fun!][well, Carry has lost literally every single worldly possession in a single move, so I'm not quite sure what to do][I'm somehow not sure if she can win with every single power other than one that only works in water and one that knocks her out in a few seconds gone. I will try to think of something to do though]*Carry looks, above all else, thoroughly angered. Unlike her usual manner of looking like a bit of a layabout slob, she is fairly well-dressed in a plain sundress and is in her most mature form. Both of these facts bring a great deal of attention to the bandaged stump that was once her arm. She is currently sitting and tapping her foot, mumbling curses in various languages under her breath*"It's not locked." *She says, her accent and anger making it sound almost more like a growl*"Eep!" *She is rather surprised by the demon* "Please I have been in terrible places and am missing an arm I am not good for eating!"*She tilts her head inquisitively**Carry's cursing grows louder for a moment, but then she takes a deep breath and seems to compose herself a bit. She ceases her foot tapping and and her cursing, crossing her legs and looking at him with eyes that still look like they're shooting daggers. Her whole pose seems a bit off due to her unfamiliarity with her new weight distribution* "It's... Alright. We signed up for danger."*She nods but writes PLEASE DO NOT HURT HIM**She nods, and reaches out to hug Katie**Lilith then nods and gets back to her meal**She writes YOU TOO**Lilith seems rather unwilling or incapable of eating her own meal, and instead is feasting herself on bread and butter. Lots of butter.*"Oh, so you are not her for eating me? That is better then." *She seems to calm down a fair bit*"It is not technically you who should be sorry. I would have liked to know about the dinosaurs ahead of time though.""All that happened after I passed out? People really should tell me these things.""Do you know why they were there? They were rather pretty when they weren't trying to be eating me. Or Succeeding in eating me.""So... Will the dinosaurs still be there with the artifact gone then?""Shoot, I was hoping to make a park..." *She says with a small pout*"Ice caps? I have a question, do you have any sewing machines?""Peter is dead?! Wait, which one was Peter again..?""Oh! I didn't really speak to him much, I was mostly bleeding on the floor when that happened.""Well, I am not dead."*She thinks, then says* "I am mad at a lot of people at the moment, but you are not too high on the list.""Stop with the apologizing, there's nothing you could have done to change it and I am not dead yet.""Really? I didn't look that much different. I think.""Oh, that wasn't my dragon onesie."*She pouts a bit* "Well, in my current state I can't exactly do it by hand. Do you think you could get one here quickly?""Good. Could you also get me large amounts of fabric?"[oh! and I sent something in modmail!]"To me?""I fell into the water, it wasn't really much of a fight.""I won't need too much, I just need to make a couple adjustments. Do you have any idea how long until the next flight?""And how long will the flight be?""Huh? Why?""I can work with this probably, I will decide whether to go later, in the meantime I have sowing to do."*She goes to bother people, the cogs in her little surprisingly cruel head already turning.*"I still have two of them!" *She says indignantly* "And what other option do I have?""And what if you don't win?"[question! would you be alright with an interaction with Carry once he leaves this little meeting with Derek?]"You can't guarantee that!""And what if you don't succeed? Then I'll be a girl with one arm and nothing else""Hide behind someone obviously, or use the dragon if I have to!""I always make it a point to let other people do work for me!" *She says with a happy smile*"Alright!"*She accepts it, though seems mildly annoyed at being reminded of her current predicament* "I think I can find my own solution to that.""I'm not just an ordinary adorable beautiful genius little girl you know, magic is something else I am amazing at." *She says with a cocky smile*"Probably! It is a complicated thing to do that kind of stuff though!""Most things are being handled already, I just wish I had more time available.""Water would be nice, and sweets.""Hm?" *She looks over at him, her mild interest softening the anger in her features slightly**Lilith, who had been wearing her coat and hat to hide her identity, lets out an annoyed growl. She walks into a nearby store, cleanly folding and placing down her disguise, then walks outside and rips a stopsign out of the ground, holding it like a club*"My limb? That is an inconvenience. The real problem is my bag." *She says in her usual obscure accent*"Yes. The one with everything I owned in it.""I am still deciding, I do wish we had more time until the next expedition.""I don't really smoke."I can't really think of a voice actress for Carry, partially due to her accent and partially due to her constantly shifting age!

Hati's voice also changes depending on mood and such

---

Trish sounds kind of like [Kimberly Brooks as Bat-girl](https://youtu.be/ls8GLxcqoMM?t=1m35s), but higher pitched since she is still going through puberty

---

Skoll sounds kind of like the comparatively lighter and higher voices done by [Patrick Seitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJyKMBW5ajc) (like Lucian), without his mask his voice is less impossing.

---

Bernard sounds like Santa Claus!

---

Akki sounds [kind of like tsubaki](https://youtu.be/vK3SApJHNFM?t=2m20s) despite her imposing figure. 

---

Dolly sounds kind of like [velma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q76evm7Qtws), sass included given her current mood after moving. "Thank you."ic: *Lilith writes on her notepad KATJA*

ooc: I'm not entirely sure, I guess a mix of various "gentle giant" characters!*Luckily, the figure, who is now quickly recovering, was apparently Lilith. She has a stop sign in one hand, holding it like a club, and seems to not be too phased by the nearby explosion. She gives a friendly wave**She covers her ears, she seems to not like loud noises. She looks over at him and tilts her head, suddenly tossing the sign like a javelin at a sand golem behind Payload**She nods, pulling up a new street sign and slamming a charging boar in the side of the head hard enough to practically disintegrate it**She tilts her head inquisitively as she slams the head entirely off of a sand golem**Lilith walks past, gnawing on what looks like a ham bone. She stops and turns to look at him, she tends to like meeting new people**She looks a bit upset at that and grumbles a bit, casually splatting another boar to her side**She tilts her head and waves, pulling her mask back down over her mouth**She shakes her head as she grabs a boar by the back leg and swings it into a golem, destroying both of them**She seems happy with the mallet, and quickly uses it to smack a boar hard enough to send it careening into one of its allies**Just before she leaves, she turns back and says* "Oh! One last question, what do we do if someone different brings back the next artifact? Who gets the reward?"*She looks around for somewhere to put her bone, before settling on holding the chewed remains of it in her mouth. She takes out a pad of paper and a chunky pencil and writes HI on it**One of the boars charges behind her, ramming into her leg. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to have done much other than alert Lilith to its presence, leading to another splattered boar**She shrugs as she brings one of her fists right through a golem's face**In the meantime, she continues her scheming* *She points to a nametag on her prison-style shirt which says LILITH*"What if Alex doesn't make it back, will the person who gets the next one get the reward?"*She seems happy to hear this, and gives him a thumbs up. Behind her a sand golem is charging, rearing back to punch*[indeed! she is schemeing on her own for the moment]*She tilts her head inquisitively as she crushes a struggling golem's skull in a headlock**She goes to accept the handshake, her grip feels remarkably strong, but it is obvious she is restraining herself enough to not harm him* *She jumps a bit in surprise and turns around, seeing the pile of sand*"Frankly this death and gloom is getting very tiring. I just want a nice cup of cocoa and a warm bed. Also an arm, but that's on a different priority list." *Right below 'terrible wonderful painful revenging' she thinks to herself**She looks a bit intrigued as she slams two boars together**She looks surprised and sprints over**She returns the thumbs up as she grabs a golem into a headlock and crushes it**She takes some time to take out her notepad and write YOU TOO**She nods, happily obliging**Carry looks rather different from how she usually does, she is fairly well-dressed in a plain sundress and is in her most mature form. Both of these facts bring a great deal of attention to the bandaged stump that was once her arm. She is working on a sewing machine, she seems to be modifying one of her two remaining suits**She jumps in surprise after that explosion, and covers her ears**She nods*"Hm? Oh, Of course you don't recognize me. I would change but I think my bandages would fall off." *She says, her accent still being a dead givaway.*"The thing in the water, I think you were there for that actually.""Goodbye!"

[question ooc, would you be alright with her using the time between then and now to modify one of her two suits into something not completely useless?]*She puts her hand up to her ear, trying to hear him better, that seems to have messed with her hearing a bit**She shakes her head**She puts down the club, and begins unwinding the coiled weighted chains on her wrists*"Fair point.""How do you mean so?" *She says, cocking an eyebrow with interest*"You want to stay as a tenant in the luxurious Cambell family castle?"hail to aberion, the hammer of dawn! yay!"You will have to be careful not to touch my things if you do!"*She begins spinning the chains, the hefty weights at the ends of them becoming terrifying weapons*I've only played a bit on my brother's account, but it is fun!"I mean my room.""I think that might have been in the bag actually.""Yes, I lost almost all of them..."[well, I had two potential ideas. One is modifying the orca one to let her move normally on land, the downside being that destabilizing it like that will remove its ability to let her command orcas and also make it break down completely in a couple days, the other is permenantly modifying the dragon one to limit its stats but let her stay in it without passing out, that process would be effectively irreversible since fixing it or making a new dragon suit from scratch would take years]"I don't need pelts, I can work on them on my own when I have free time. Please get a sewing machine for impaired peoples though."IC: *Lilith shrugs*

OOC: I would think Black Paladin, simply because he literally works for the devil[it is an acronym that stands for Son Of a B-word I do not want to say!][oh! I probably should have explained that in context. a "Hardcore SOB" doesn't necessarily mean someone mean or cruel, it means someone tough and scary and often rather extreme in their actions.]*Lilith, wearing her full disguise of coat, hat, and gloves, steps into the deck to get some fresh air**Each weight is now spinning with enough force tor am right through the head of a golem without slowing**She eventually seems to grow bored after clearing out a majority of the golems in the immediate area**With most of the golems in the area dealt with, she begins shaping the sand into a little hill**A fairly loud thumping noise can be heard coming closer**Lilith is walking towards the room, sniffing the air a bit*"Yes, I apologize if I looks a bit different." *She seems surprisingly composed for someone who recently lost her arm**Lilith tilts her head, squatting down to get a closer look at the kitty**She takes out her notepad and writes MAKING A SAND CASTLE**With her mask in the way it likely just licks the mask, but she seems happy with it. She gingerly reaches out towards it**Lilith jumps and falls back in surprise, scrambling back a bit herself**Lilith stares back, and then waves**She lightly pokes the cat**She does her best to pet the kitty's belly gently.**She waves to him again with her other hand**She is unwilling to move the kitten from its current resting place, so she can't really move much**She takes out a pad of paper from her pocket and begins writing, she writes HI**She writes WHO ARE YOU?**She points to a nametag on her shirt that says LILITH**She waves again**She writes back HE IS FUZZY**She nods**She nods**She just keeps piling sand up**She continues to play with the cat gently**Again, she's still wearing a mask, but she moves forward a bit to boop his nose with her mask**She seems content to lay on the floor with a kitten on her*[end here?][I think you may have dropped this]*She notices, and turns so that her arm is less visible, looking a bit embarrassed.* "So, I heard that Peter did not make it back, and that he tried to leave me down there.""Indeed. I do wish I had a chance to give Peter a piece of my mind though... If he hadn't done that Mason might have been able to get my bag back.""You do shit like this often?" "Sounds like a shitty job." *She waves happily, she is practically bouncing with joy* *She shrugs* "If you say so. I don't think I've seen you around here before." "Right, I'm sure hanging out on rooftops in the middle of the day carrying an arsenal is very inconspicuous." "Except you just did." "So, how many vamps are in this city then?""So, good chance of getting mauled?" *She writes YOU'RE UP!*"I meant if I'm walking down the street at night or something, there's a good chance someone's going to try to maul me?" *She writes HUG?*"In other words, probably. Great." *She says sarcastically* "You just told me I'm probably going to have some undead asshole trying to rip my throat out, I've got my reasons." "Nope, but I haven't died thusfar and that's still got a pretty good chance of happening too." "Sure." *She says a bit incredulously* "You're sure you can kill all these, right?" *Lilith picks her up in a large happy hug* "Great. And if you don't?" "Oh. Interesting magic. Thank you." "So there's no backup plan." *Lilith eventually puts her down and writes OH! I SHOULD PROBABLY BE MORE GENTLE* *She still looks a bit worried, she writes YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WALK AROUND, RIGHT?**She writes OKAY... OH! AND I HAD A QUESTION**IS IT ALRIGHT IF I GUARD YOU?*"Wow, edgy." *She writes STAY AROUND TO KEEP YOU SAFE**She looks a bit worried, and writes CAN I AT LEAST GUARD YOU SOMETIMES...?*"Edgy.""Kind of?"*She looks happy about that* *She writes YES, BUT I ALSO WANT TO KEEP YOU SAFE!*"Wow." *Trish was walking down the street being generally grumbly when she sees the drunk fairy* *She nods, but writes BUT I WILL TOTALLY DO IT A LOT, WARNING YOU AHEAD OF TIME*"Ya, I bet that happens to you a lot" "Uh... Hi?" *She looks a bit surprised to see a fairy, and might be wondering if someone slipped her something* "... Am I on drugs?" "You're so stereotypical it's not even funny." "You know, the whole 'silent protector who's lost touch with the people they're protecting' shtick. You're out of touch with society." "Okay? And you're... You know, real?" "Ya, I just... Didn't realize fairies were real I guess." "Well, that's new then." *She writes BECAUSE WE ARE BESTIES*[ya, he feels bad now] [i meant more the 'everybody dislikes me' kind of feels bad] "Why apologize?" "Then why are you running around getting hammered?" "I'm unlikely to do that. Plus, what about everyone else who probably saw you already?" "Sure." *She says incredulously* #DAYNATS

A type of tiny animal-like plant, each one looks like a small humanoid form made of leaves about an inch or two tall with a 2-3 inch puffball (like that of a dandelion) for a head. During the day they use the winds caused by the sun to float around, absorbing moisture from the air. At night they 'nest' together in a tree. They may look humanoid, but they don't seem to have any serious intelligence. They do know enough to stick around with water sources and avoid danger. They 'see' through a kind of sonar, letting them see even right through solid ash and sand to predators or water sources underneath. When they collect enough nutrients in their current tree, one daynat will drift off and plant itself somewhere suitable, the rest of the 'hive' will bring it a thick syrup with water and nutrients, and it will grow into a new tree. Daynat syrup is a good source of water and nutrients, but can be toxic in high amounts. In low amounts it instead acts as a painkiller and mild natural high. Some people get them to stick around for short periods of time by giving them water, granting the person an early warning system for predatory attacks, and some Thinkers can trick daynats into thinking they are a tree, getting the daynat to stick around and gather water for them. "You have a reason for me to not tell anyone?" "M-hm." *She seems to be a bit bored now, and starts checking her phone* They also filter water they drink, and can detect water that is too toxic for them to filter and avoid it. "Ya. Say cheese by the way." *Her phone's camera flashes* "Give me a reason to." *She smirks a bit* "Ya, don't try that." *She puts her phone back in her shorts pocket* "What the...? What the fuck is this thing?" suggestion! could mutants also have just one or two powers, but be more powerful with them than normal? for example, maybe a human mover/scry would be weaker at moving than a human mover, but a mutant mover/scry might be just as good at (or even better than, depending on their mutation) a human pure mover."Let me out of this fucking bubble." "Fuck that!" *She tries to kick the bubble* okay!*Does it move?* *She sees that, and with a small grin starts punching it closer* "If you don't want to let me out, I'll just pop this bubble on your head!" *She punctuates the end of her sentence with a much more powerful punch as her eyes and hair turn white*[wouldn't that require popping the bubble?] [oh! okay!]

*Well, Trish still has forward momentum from her punches, with which she's sent flying a bit away* *Trish gets up, her hair and eyes going back to normal* "Ouch.." "Because I didn't like being stuck in a bubble?" "Relax, I'm mostly keeping this so later I can make sure I wasn't just drugged or something." "*But* if you piss me off I make no promises." "You better be. And don't do that again please. It was a cool trick though." "Don't give a shit if you do it to most other people." "Hm... This does give me an idea I would like to try at some point though." *She smiles* "It would be  bit embarrassing to say. By the way, can you sense graveyards? as in if a new one is made can you sense that it just happened?""So? Stereotypes are boring." "And you can teleport to them?" "Also usually made to be annoying." "Okay." *She gets a small smile* "So... Do you seriously not have a plan for if you lose?" "Sounds like a shitty backup plan." "No reason." "Great." *She says sarcastically* "Just try not to let them all run loose. I have enough problems with that 'miss massacre' bitch after me." *She holds up a sign saying YAY!*"Indeed. One last question- do they need to be human bodies?" [okay! one moment!]

"Seriously? Sweet. She's got some kind of vendetta against me because she thinks I killed her dad." "Am I? I am sorry to hear that.""Well, sucks that my fire isn't holy then." "I like to learn about spirits." "Seriously, you hand out business cards?" "Well... Thanks." *She thinks, then writes I DUNNO, JUST STICKING AROUND TO KEEP YOU SAFE. IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE TO GUARDING?*"Don't tell anyone I said this but I wasn't really sure I could handle her." "Well, I had a way of dealing with that, but I doubt it will work twice." "Not my style, plus she would probably dodge it. I just fought her on a wall, speed doesn't mean shit when gravity's not on your side." "Rather not take the chance. She seriously fucking wants me dead." "Honestly... That would probably be best." *She seems a bit uncomfortable asking for help* *She writes GOOD!*"What do you mean 'how'?" "Dunno, killing her? Stopping her from killing me and my friends? The basics." *She sounds a bit sarcastic* "I don't know enough about her to make one." "So.... Do the bodies need to be human?" "What, investigate her? I tried. She's got no history and no contacts." "What creatures have souls?" "Right, because they love giving that up to random passersby." "So, would, for example, a dog or mouse have a soul?" "If you seriously think robbing a police headquarters is a viable option and not a terrible idea you really are out of touch." "But still a soul?" "Okay. It was nice talking with you." "I... Don't really have many allies like that. Or at all really." *She sadly writes OKAY...*"Not necessarily at the moment." *She shrugs, but writes I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE*[she doesn't know that, she doesn't know liv well enough to be comfortable asking her to rob a police station either]

"Do I look like the persuasive type?" "I wouldn't mind walking and talking a bit longer." [okay!]

"What's that supposed to mean?" *She pouts a bit under her mask and writes BUT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN*"Why?" "I notice you haven't really asked me much." "Indeed, I just feel a bit bad about how little I have told you thus far." "And?" "If I can't handle something on my own then that means I need to train harder and get good enough *to* deal with it on my own." "Then I'll run, get stronger, and deal with it later." *She sighs and writes I JUST WANNA KEEP YOU SAFE...*"Ya, and I can't afford to not push them." "Don't be. I'd rather be ready for whatever comes." "What?" *She seems to be pouting, judging by her body language* "Haven't watched those ones yet. Why'd you say it though?" "That's a bit sad." *Now she looks guilty, she holds up a sign saying SORRY...*"Fair point." *She nods*"You too, vampire hunter." *She nods glumly* "Indeed. It really does sound lonely." "Do you enjoy company?" *She nods* "Good luck." "So long." *She does a small salute back* *She stays outside, listening for when the shooting stops* "That is good, I would feel terrible if I was annoying you." "Woo, you lived.""So, do they all turn into ashes now or is that just a movie thing?" "Great. Rats and shit can't get infected, right?" *She hugs back, then writes OH! WANT TO MEET OTTO BY THE WAY?*"Good, otherwise leaving those bodies in there would be a shitty idea." *She writes OKAY, BE RIGHT BACK! and goes to find otto*

/u/ottofowl"Good. I would rather know than continue doing it." "What you've got a cleanup crew?" "So you've got an army?" "Sounds like you do." "Armies have medics and stuff too." "I was pointing out that not all people in the army have combat roles." "Would you like to get some tea?" "So, mind telling me about vampires?" "Anything important." "And do you turn if you get bit?" "That's got to be a disappointment to red cross." *She says jokingly* "I know a shop nearby, it should still be open." "So, is there a cure? other than bullets of course." *She nods and leads her to a small shop, easily overlooked by most people. It has a somewhat dark atmosphere about it, and there's an almost visible cloud of incense* "You tried?" "What, so they get more powerful by being more evil or something?""What about drinking from a blood bank or something? or animals?" "But they still get powers from that?" "What kind of powers?" "What's the hunger like?""So, they basically have to do it?" "Got it." *She is obviously spooked of John, so she tries to wave Otto over from the doorframe instead of entering the room* "I like knowing about things that might try to maul me"

[she's semi-considering becoming a vampire]"That the only way to kill them?" "And they just heal from anything else?" "Any scars?" "What, you have healing magic or something?" *Well, they get a table then. Other than the somewhat gothic atmosphere it seems pretty comfy* "Don't need it. Thanks for the offer." "Indeed." *She sits at one of the tables. It should be noted that a few paper charms similar to the one she made earlier can be seen around the shop*"For what?""What, you think I've got scars?" "Indeed. I find it quite calming." "They were a bit of a gift""If I get a scar, I need to keep it. I need to remember that."*She shrugs* "I felt like it.""Thanks... But I'll keep my scars." "I'll accept help taking down Ms.Massacre once we can find her." "Oh no, they do." "Ward away angry spirits." "A few.""Sure."*She picks the kitten up and begins looking around for small objects* "They are no longer a problem, thanks to the charms." "Indeed, the owner offered to give me some free tea for it." "Indeed. One moment-" *She says something in Japanese to a passing waitress* "Really?" *She looks a bit surprised at that comment, probably due to her appearance* "Also, what kind of tea would you like?" "Alright." *She says something else in Japanese to the waitress, who then walks off* "It will just be a moment." *Lilith is too busy being horrified, and is frozen in abject terror* *The place seems to not get much business at this hour, but the few people who are their are more preoccupied with reading and writing*"Indeed. It's more active during the day." *In her panic, she picks up the pencil and tosses it in their general direction* *She waves at Otto, then ducks away to avoid John seeing her* *She still doesn't know sign language and she is currently hiding behind the doorframe.* *She writes CAN WE PLEASE NOT STAY NEAR THE SPOOKY SKELETON..? and slides it back**She writes HE IS A SKELETON! I'M TERRIFIED OF HIM! back* *She writes DON'T YOU CARE THAT I'M SCARED...?**She waits a bit, then writes I WILL LISTEN FROM HERE**Lilith looks rather surprised and touched by this. She writes a message saying OTTO, COULD YOU COME OVER HERE FOR A BIT?**She immediately hugs him* *She keeps hugging him for a while, and can't exactly write anything* [end?] *She turns around fairly nonchalantly* *She eventually takes her mask off, writing THAT WAS SWEET! THANK YOU OTTO.*"Just having a friendly chat." *She smiles* "That's not what you just said!"*She instead stands on her own* "Sure. You too." oh! welcome to the sub! it is nice to see new people! Also, like Ms.Rin said, please try to link your powers to the wiki, like so!  [artificial heart](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Artificial_Heart) and [invisibility]( http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Invisibility)! 

also, i am not a mod, but as a side note using his invisibility to dodge attacks would boost reflex probably, not durability. durability is (usually) for tanking an attack that *has* hit you, not preventing it from hitting anything in the first place."You just sad you thought it was okay to hit me!""That's a lie!" "Not if you just TOLD THEM like you said you would!" "All I asked you to do was TELL THEM WHAT THE RINGS DID and TELL THEM I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN!"*She growls and turns away, then starts walking* "Well, it looks like I have to since you don't want to!""Sparky if you aren't going to do it then I am, it's that simple. And when I'm done we're going to have a talk about some of the things you've been saying!"#The Pariahs

**Leader:** No one single leader

**General Description:** A loose organization of mutants outcast from their respective societies, they are many small groups who keep in touch rather than being a single large group. They attempt to keep new mutants safe and give them a place in the wasteland, sometimes resorting to some rather cutthroat tactics to do so. They accept non-mutants to help them only on very rare occasions, such as if the person has proven themselves by defending mutants several times.

**Groups:** they make several different kinds of groups, suited for different tasks.

&gt; **Hearts:** A group of mutants whose job is to provide a place for weak, young, sick, old, isolated, or recently abandoned mutants to stay. They have two main jobs- provide home and safety for those mutants to weak to protect themselves and raise and teach mutants who are either young or went a long time without any form of education. 

&gt; **Bodies:** These groups have the job of searching for new mutants. They are normally small, efficient units rather than any large group, consisting of often less than 5 people. They scour the wastes, often following humans at a distance, and take unwanted mutants (sometimes by force, if the humans are uncooperative) to a heart. They also Do other general dangerous work, like exterminating monsters that begin to nest too close to a heart.

&gt; **Minds:** These groups have the job of scouting the wastelands for anything of importance, and more importantly of keeping tabs on large human groups and interacting with them when needs be. 

**Tasks:** Mutants are often assigned a "role" or "title" based on the nature of their powers and what they are suited to doing. A mutant is capable of having more than one title, but are unlikely to have too many.

&gt; **Shield:** A shield is, to put it lightly, a powerhouse. A powerful brute or mover usually who is capable of fantastic combat prowess. They act as guards for groups usually. 

&gt; **Cloak:** A Cloak is a mutant whose powers help keep the groups safe indirectly, usually a scry or thinker who can make people or monsters less likely to enter the area, or let the group move around them unnoticed. 

&gt; **Mask:** A Mask is a mutant with few identifying mutant traits, or with ones they can hide with relative ease. These people often have the job of interacting with humans when it is needed. Any human who is accepted into the Pariahs is automatically assigned this role, in addition to whatever else they may earn.

&gt; **Hammer:** A Hammer is a mutant whose powers are suited to building up infrastructure or otherwise providing shelter and safety in the physical sense. It also includes people who can make farms, wells, and similar structures for sustaining life. 

&gt; **Bow:** A Bow is a mutant suited to scouting in some way, usually a scry or thinker, whose job is to find useful items and places (fields of plants, small water reserves, monster dens, etc)

&gt; **Belt:** One of the most important types, a belt is a mutant whose powers allow them to keep track of other members of the pariahs more easily. They are usually scrys or thinkers with long ranges whose primary job is to keep the groups in touch. 

&gt; **Bead:** A bead is, to put it simply, a mutant who is pretty useless. As mean as that may sound, a bead refers to a mutant who is too young, old, or just weak to be of much use to the group. 

&gt; **Thread:** The closest thing to a leader that the pariahs have, a thread's job is just to act as a unifying force, a local leader of sorts. Rather than being based on powers this is based purely on who out of a group the group members find to be most worthy of the title. 

"Will you answer me?" oh! you are asking for villains for an event thing? sure! any idea what general power level will be desired also will they need to be outright evil or are moral-less people who happen to be doing bad things at the moment (like mercenaries) okay too? okay! any idea what kind of rolls would be useful or useless? okaaay! i mostly meant, for example, will it be something big and flashy that a stealthy character would be useless for, or something quiet and subtle that "gratuitous explosion man" or something would be bad atokay!"Good. Now why did you assume I didn't trust you and that I was doing things 'just because you didn't want me to'?" [okay, here I'm going to skip to a couple days later with Skoll finally getting Hati the letter, one moment!]

*Eventually, after a while of searching, Skoll sat down in an alley, tired from walking so much for so many days straight* 

"Jesus, how hard can a girl be to find?" 

"Who're we looking for?" *Hati says, jumping down to sit beside him*

"Some girl named-" *He looks at her, falling silent. She stares at her own reflection in his helmet and waves* "Well, you know what they say it's always in the last place you look."

"Oh! Did we find somethign! Also who are you?"

"Skoll, I'm-"

"SKOOOOLL!" *She tacklehugs him and begins repeating his name while cuddling uncomfortably tight* 

"WHOA! Hati, could you back off a bit...? I was kind of looking forward to winning the 'most intact lungs' award today."

"Okay!" *She pops off, she now has a tail which is wagging happily*

"Thanks, I'll be sure to mention you in my acceptance speech. Now, if you don't mind think you could take something off my hands for me?" *He takes a letter out of his jacket*

"Sure! Is it edible?"

"I mean, probably, but Thor would be upset if you didn't read it first"

"THOOOOOR!" *She grabs it in a flash* "I need to read this in private, see you later best brother ever!" *She hugs him again and zips off*

"Hey, wait! Shit... Well, at least I can fuck off and go do work now."

---

*Meanwhile, Hati runs off to open and read the letter* 

/u/Sir_Willis_CMS *Hati, in an abandoned building, is looking at the letter in shock. Her perspective on it is likely... Different from what Thor intended. She sees it as "you messed up I don't like you anymore it was a mistake to start going out with you good luck with life so long PS kill my sister so I can go date someone else". Hati grits her teeth as she begins to increase in temperature, rapidly heating until she combusts into nearly white flames.* "All this... After all the things I DID?" *She puts her fist right through the wall, punching molten bricks away* "When I was THERE FOR HER?" *She kicks a metal support, the metal rapidly heating and bending* "*This* Is what I get?" *She ignites the paper, burning it to ash in seconds.* "She told me I was special! That I was her only FRIEND!" *Her silver armor disappears, and her hair is let loose again, turning her back to her old appearance.* "You don't just LIE about things like that!" *Her teeth grow and sharpen to razor-point daggers.* "I got fucking LIED TO AGAIN!" *She grows small horns from her forehead, and a burning chain collar appears around her neck again* "I HATE LIARS AND CHEATS AND PHONIES AND-" *She stops her small rampage for a few moments as a large grin spreads on her face* "Tricksters... No, I don't hate those ones. I *like* tricks." *Her voice sounds maliciously amused. Her fires die down a bit, reverting to an immense body temperature. Her horns are hidden behind her hair, and she wraps her scarf around her mouth. A pair of headphones appear on her head, blaring music into her ears.*  "I have plenty of people to go see.""Well, nice to know."[that's all for here, but it will certainly continue later.]"What? Of course not. You're fucking gorgeous, and don't say anything like 'but my eyes' that stuff looks awesome. Plus it's probably someone's kink.""Lots of guys like that stuff, and girls too. Plus your hair is great.""And?""Want help with that?" *She has a small grin*"What, I can figure out how hair dye works! Probably.""Oh, pretty!" *She begins crawling closer*"What..?"*She props herself up and attempts to take the gloves, they look pretty and comfy*"No, I'm your friend and you promised to let me help you.""If you say so..." *She looks a bit upset*"Really? What would I wear?""When's the party gonna be?""I said when, 'Shade.""Oh shit, I need to go get ready."IC: *Lilith writes SPOOKY GHOST OR SKELETON*

OOC: uuuuum... Does The Nightmare Before Christmas count?"Well, we could go costume shopping together!""Sweet, let's go!"*She begins leading the way to the nearest store selling costumes, probably a party store*"I'm sure you'd do great, but I don't know if we've got the time. Think you could do it that fast?""Well, I could get one while you go make one if you like."*Skoll has, surprisingly, shown up. His costume seems to be that of the [Red Hood](http://img03.deviantart.net/a568/i/2011/301/a/1/red_hood_colored_by_tengukarasu-d4e7sp3.jpg) from batman, but all white and grey and with the usual mask swapped out for a normal white motorcycle helmet* "Sorry, best I could come up with on short notice.""Alright, see you at the party!" 


[end?]*Someone shows up in an obviously store-bought but still rather elegant and well-fitting [vampire outfit](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8/221790308/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8.jpg), complete with pale makeup and a bit of fake blood near the edge of their mouth. They look... Familiar, but with the makeup the person (probably a guy? hard to tell with those features) is difficult to identify. Whoever he is, his most striking feature is probably the long flowing white hair that goes nearly halfway down his back.*"Skoll, nice to meet you. I've heard a bit about you but not much, I'm the guy Jack asked to deliver the letter." *He holds out his hand for a handshake**Hati shows up, though it seems to have been on accident, she just wandered on. Small horns poke out from her messy hair, and her appearance seems far closer to its original one. She has her scarf pulled up over her mouth**They smile at her, and a- rather familiar- voice responds* "Oh, what's up 'Shade? The party's going great!" *That... Is not a guy. In fact it seems to be Trish.*"No problem. Finally got it to her recently by the way, but she ran off before I could say anything to her.""Nah, plenty of people will come, don't worry.""Seriously? Sorry about that...""Ya, you're pretty well liked around here. And don't frown so much, your smile looks great.""Well, that's good. Plus your apartment seems to have gotten cleaned up fairly fast, so at least you weren't on the street or anything.""Nice, powers rock. So, any particular reason Hati is being such a nuisance?" "Why'd she go after *you* then?"*Skoll, in what looks like a white biker outfit, shows up to the party. He's still in his helmet*"I'm going to assume from the number of y's in that that you're either really drunk or really like bikers. I'm kind of guessing the first one. Also, sup?""Got it, jealous ex. Psychopathic jealous ex. Is there any reason that she basically tackled me when she heard my name?""Well, first time ever having a superheroine and also kind of god compliment me, that's pretty flattering.""No I mean Hati. I said I was "Skoll" and she tackled me and hugged tight enough that I probably won't be winning any intact-ribcage contests for a while.""Oh. Sorry, I couldn't find a girl costume that fit and also didn't look like a stripper outfit." *She doesn't seem to realize what was so upsetting about the mixup*"So are you two together then?""Fair point. And don't take this the wrong way, but I probably wouldn't go after you at the moment either, you're hotter than a napalm bombshell but between the breakup and the alcohol there's no way that taking advantage of the situation wouldn't be a dick move."*She turns to look at him, and it's obvious from her eyes and cheeks that she's smiling even if her mouth can't be seen* "Hiiiiiiii Johnny!""That's what people tell me. How much have you had to drink anyway?""You alright? I don't know how much asgardians can drink but I'm taking a wild guess at saying it probably isn't literally infinite.""I guess..." *He sounds a bit unsure.*"I don't know. She's unpredictable, but I don't think everything's really *random*. It might not make sense but I think there's a plan in this whole thing somewhere.""How's it goin?" *She walks over, her gait a bit odd and... slippery? The way she weaves back and forth as she walks looks almost serpentine* "Don't worry, I got this-" *He pulls a straw out of his jacket and slides the visor on his helmet up just enough to slip one end in, it looks odd but it works. He takes a drink then says* "And I don't know for sure, I don't know her well enough."*She looks over at him, and smiles under her scarf* "Hiiiiii Sparky!""What do you mean by off?" *She tilts her head... a bit too far. Not supernaturally, but it looks uncomfortable.*"I've been fine! How about youuuu?" *She doesn't comment on it*"I don't think so! Probably.""Hey, if it's that bad I can just swap into my usual clothes." *She seems a bit sad about Nightshade's reaction to her outfit*"Oh! Why'd you break your nose?""I move how I want to!""I've only met her a single time now. She sure acts otherwise, though.""Exactly. That's why I want to figure her out.""Oh! Why did it do that?""Soooooo how've you been?""Huh...? Oh. Oooooh." *She blushes as well, but it's mostly hidden by her makeup* "So... I look good then..?"*She pouts*"I take it you don't like my odds?""Hm? I'm handsome? Also you didn't answer my question before!""That's... pretty flattering actually.""Well, at least I've got three people cheering me on in this.""Don't worry about it, you didn't know so it doesn't count or something, right?""I forget!" *She smiles again under her scarf*"Nice costume by the way, it's awesome that you made one so fast."*She pouts at him* "Stop being so grumpy, Sparky!""It would help if those three weren't me, myself, and I though.""Didn't you just say I didn't have a chance?" *He grins under his mask, and his voice shows it*"Thanks. So, what kind of drinks have you got here?""You sure it's okay to be wearing it? I don't want you getting sick from a dirty mask or anything.""Good! Did you get over your bad breakup?""Oh! Nevermind then, you seemed kind of grumpy." *She goes back to her cheery self*"Good, the desert community of liv-er will be thankful for your generosity." *He continues with his drink*"Yay! Who was it anyway?""Oh! Who?""I can hold my alcohol.""Alright, I'm just a bit worried about you sometimes. You were a nightmare of a patient last time." *She says with a bit of a laugh, remembering her refusing to take medicine* "I am?""First one to vomit and pass out then wake up in a stranger's bed loses?" *He says jokingly before taking another sip* "Though I suppose that last part has a chance of counting as a win.""It's nice to plan ahead. Mind if the creepy motorcycle guy knows? Don't want to hit on anyone who's off-limits after all.""Which one?""I'm way too young to be your mom, Nightshade.""Alright, just making sure."*She stops, freezing in place for a few seconds, then her head slowly turns to lock eyes with him* "...Really?" "Oh! I don't think I'm touchy. Am I?""Well... I didn't mind taking care of you. Even if I'm not your mom or whatever.""No prob." *She smiles, revealing the fake fangs she's wearing with the costume*"Well, I can't tell you that, it's my secret identity." *He says playfully*"How so?""Say no more, I'll keep my distance. Need a wingman by any chance?" *Someone shows up in an obviously store-bought but still rather elegant and well-fitting [vampire outfit](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8/221790308/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8.jpg), complete with pale makeup and a bit of fake blood near the edge of their mouth. They look... Familiar, but with the makeup the person (probably a guy? hard to tell with those features) is difficult to identify. Whoever he is, his most striking feature is probably the long flowing white hair that goes nearly halfway down his back.**She pouts at him again*"What can I say, it's a gift and a curse this razor wit of mine.""Alright, I'll cheer you on from the side, waving pom-poms then."*The person looks over and waves back, then speaks in a familiar- and more than moderately feminine- voice* "So, you showed up too?" *It seems that that is actually Trish*"Aw, don't feel bad. I use humor to conceal my 'deep and traumatic character backstory'" *He says jokingly**He laughs* "Alright, you're flying solo then."*That makes her happy*"Still, I could give a snap-preview, you're drunk enough that it'll probably be a shoddy memory at best." *He looks both ways to check if anyone is paying attention, then quickly flips up his reflective visor, revealing [his eyes and a very small bit of his face](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9y26Qv4s1ql5h4t.jpg).*"What, did you expect somebody else?""So, mind if I ask you a question?" *His voice seems to have gotten more serious, and a bit quieter to signal her to get a bit closer so they won't be as easily overheard*"But I like being cute!""Oh ya almost forgot those! I had to do a lot of this costume, you would not believe how long it took to get my hair this straight"*He jokingly puts a finger over where his mouth would be and shushes her as he flips the visor back down*"Oh. Ya, lots of people aren't recognizing me like this.""Yay!""Hm?""Like what? Unless you aren't supposed to tell them, in which case I don't want to be the reason you feel guilty in the morning. Well, guilty for other reasons maybe but I'd feel guilty too in those situations.""Thanks, ditto. It was a bit weird to have Nightshade hit on me though.""Thanks.." *She sounds a bit flattered and embarrassed* "Yaaaaay!""Yep, my biggest secret, given away. Whatever will I do?" *He says jokingly as he grabs a drink, sticks a straw under his visor, and begins to drink while they chat*"She doesn't, she thought I was a guy.""Need any help getting to a bed or something?""It was... Flattering, but strange.""Alright." *He offers her a hand to help her over there.*"What do you mean?""Ya, me too... Wanna get some fresh air or something?"*He helps walk her over to the couch, also making sure there's not too much of a mess on it*"Not at the moment. Also, lie on your side in case you pass out. It would suck if a goddess choked to death on her own vomit."*She freezes, stops her revelry, and slowly turns her head to look him in the eyes**She seems a bit annoyed and embarrassed at the implication, even as a joke.*"God dammit why does everyone assume I'm a lesbian?""I thought only kids under three could choke on small parts?" *He says in a bit of self-deprecative humor* "In all seriousness though I'm flattered, and definitely think of calling me when you're not too drunk to stand right.""How's Thor doing?""It's getting old, everyone's like that."*She walks out of the church a bit so they can get away from the party for a minute or two.* "I love nights like this, autumn air feels great.""Thanks. So, you staying conscious or no?""Do not talk about that, Sparky.""It seems to be to everyone else.""Good, I actually had a couple questions.""Really? It's always way too hot out in summer.""Because it happens all the time! I'm tired of that being the first thing people think about me.""Because I said not to!" *She smiles, but it looks a bit too manic**He sighs* "I'm probably gonna ruin the mood. I need to know about Hati.""Not me. Last summer it was so hot I spent most of the day in my room in my boxers.""Just... A lot of things. Like why she tackled me and seemed overjoyed when she heard my name even though we've never met.""You'd be surprised."*She pokes his nose twice* "Touchy touchy!""Alright... I'm worried about her. She seems like she's pretty messed up after what happened.""And? Does she buy into all that or something?"*She sighs* "Still, not your fault, sorry I snapped at you.""Anyway, nice costume.""None taken. So she follows along with all the old earth myths?"*She seems confused by his reaction, having completely forgotten that that would hurt*"You here with anybody?""Sad, but maybe useful."*She steps out of the way fairly easily* "Hey! What was that for?""Cool, I got to meet her recently. She thought I was challenging her to a race for some reason.""I'm trying to figure her out. The things she does seem unpredictable, but I don't think they're random. I want to figure her out so maybe I can stop her from hurting anyone else." "I hope so. It's kinda strange, a heroine and goddess and it turns out she's just as fragile as the rest of us.""We did? When?""I would have won if it was.""Anything else you can tell me that might help that? Weird things she does?""Got it. Rest up, I'd rather you be feeling fine and I have to wait a bit longer to figure this out than the other way around."*She pouts* "Hati is not  bad!""Why did you break up...?"*She grins* "I'll try.""Want me to get you some water or something?"*She growls at him*"Well, nice to see everyone smiling, this is a party after all.""One sec." *He goes to get a glass of water for her**He comes back with the glass* "Drink slow, and try not to puke unless you really have to.""Anyway, I'm gonna go make sure Nightshade isn't eating or drinking strange things, see you around."*She lets her scarf fall a bit, revealing that her mouth seems to have turned into a monstrous jagged maw of knife-like teeth* "Fair point, but I'm a sucker for damsels in distress.""I'm not so sure about that. We all have our emotional weakpoints, they just vary from person to person."[end?]"That guy?" "Well, let's just hope for the best."*She seems to grow larger as she growls, beginning to tower over him*"Didn't realize that was a archetype.""Well, at least it doesn't sound like too bad of a one too be. Could be worse, like "hits on drunk girls" guy or "cries himself to sleep" guy."*She is still growling*"Thankfully you have no proof that I fit either of those criteria."*She zips out of the way, ending up behind him in a flash. She's at least a head taller than him by now, and she suddenly tackled him from behind*"Not right now though. For now you need to rest up.""Is that a threat or a promise?""Well, I'll count it as a little of both. Threatened, complimented, and hit on by a goddess in one night, pretty interesting watercooler story."*He smiles under his mask* "Alright, you should get some rest. I'll make sure nobody tries anything while you're out cold."*She tries to hold his arms down*"Trust me, it's tempting." *he says with a sigh**He looks over her, then groans and mumbles to himself* "I am getting way too chivalrous for this... Thor, I am amazingly flattered and *very much* would like to take up the offer, but you're in no state to be making choices like that right now.""Stop it. Now." *there's no playfullness in her voice this time**He sighs* "I'm really sorry, and hope you'll thank me for this when you're sober.""Alright, want me to get you a blanket?""One sec." *He goes to look for a blanket, coming back with one off of one of the beds*"Alright, sleep tight and try not to call a thunderstorm on us or anything. I'll take guard duty."[want to skip to when she wakes up?]"I know. But sometimes someone needs to figure themselves out, it's alright to be there for her but she needs to be able to stand on her own eventually.""Is that all?""Yay..." *She seems content to sit and rest for a while, happy that things aren't terrible for once*"I get it.""And she didn't tell you anything else about it?"*Skoll is sitting in front of the couch, sipping a beer and flipping through channels on the TV*"Ya, she needs help. Unless there was a double-entendre in there that I missed.""What if I *knew* why she did it?""Which half? The help or the entendres?""The saaaame reason she lied to me."*Ya, he's keeping himself entertained while on guard duty. He also has his back to her and against the front of the couch*"Got it. Just... Remember what's happened.""So, woke up already sleeping beauty?""And the reason everything went wrong." *She seems fairly engry about this topic*"Alright. Remember, even if she's hotter than the sun in the middle of July, with how Thor is right now it might be a smarter idea to just say no until she gets more stable, even if you end up single before that.""Gonna take a wild guess and say you're still drunk off your ass?""I would show you the letter about it but I kind of burnt it."[oh! sorry for the confusion!]

"Alright, just making sure.""Alright, feel like you need to puke? I promised Alice I wouldn't do it on the furniture but if you do I'll take the blame.""Oh ya! Her sister put a curse on her that made it so she can't have a good relationship so she had to dump me on one of the most important days of her life and take some other bitch to the ceremony thingy instead and then get mad at me for being upset and say it was a mistake to start dating me in the first place and tell me to go kill her sister on Niflheimr so she can go date someone else!" *The entire time she says this she is smiling, but obviously upset from her shaking*"Good because I think she can and would kick my ass.""Think begging would help?""Alright, I'll write my will then.""You can have it now if you like." "You want the authentic bloodstains?"*He chuckles* "Didn't figure you'd be a hematolagniac" "Like what?""I'm not that shy, but if you are then feel free." *He says teasingly*"Then by all means, whisper. Mind if I join you on the couch by the way? This carpet is great but I lost feeling in my ass five minutes ago""I know, but this isn't the kind of thing I like taking any chances on."*He stands up, stretches, and takes the seat next to her**He nods along, looking a bit impressed under his mask* "Well, the Asgardians really do know how to party.""Kinky girl. If you sober up and decide white leather biker guys aren't your thing you mind giving me her number?""Really?""And leave such a great conversation partner?" "I take it you're talking from experience?""Noted. Still, you sure you want to just send me off? I'm fine just chilling out here for a while. I can talk to her any time- probably. What's her name anyway?""Thanks for the heads up. For the time being I'll admit I'm waiting to see what you think when you're not drunk though.""Ah. She told me she was dating a girl named Freya, that could get... Messy. Or not, depending on you guys's personalities, some groups can pull that off.""I get it. You're in a fucked-up situation in general, sexual tension isn't making it any easier.""Yep. This kind of reminds me of a story a friend of mine told me.""I forget some of the details, but he started getting a crush on a friend of his, she was cute and they where good friends. He started wondering if he really wanted to date her, but when he finally worked up the courage to ask her he realized something on their date.""That's really as far as it went between them. They liked being around each other and he thought she was cute, but they didn't really like each other any more than normal friends. Just goes to show sometimes friends with sexual tension are just that, and given the kind of situation you came out of you might want to be careful about relationships in general."*He shrugs* "Alright, just a piece of advice from a creepy guy in a helmet.""Still though even if you like her for real, it's common courtesy to not mess with a relationship that's already going. Unless she and Freya are cool with it of course."*He shrugs* "She needs help, I'm a hero. Bullets and cackling fashion designers aren't the only things I try to save people from.""If it gets to be too much you can just stay in your room for a bit and put on some nice loud music. Your room's got a lock, right?""You sure?""Alright, feel free to call me whenever you feel like it, preferably if you're sober and don't think I'm a creep still." *He stands, stretching* "It was nice talking to you again, Thor."*He wanders into the party a bit, looking for Vallir while also trying to keep an eye on Thor*"Ya, there was a fashion designer terrorist one time. Had to cut off his hand with a boomerang when he tried to press a detonator that would blow up the building and all the models, then I walked on stage in a suit and said to the model "looks like you could use a hand". That was pretty corny in retrospect."*RPing him meeting Vallir or no?**Alright! Where does he see her in the party? Also, we don't have to if you don't want to**He saunters nearby, sipping his drink through a straw as usual, and comments* "Asgard gets superheroes, magic, *and* girls like you? Not fair.""What? I make bad puns sometimes.""Skoll, no relation to the myth- probably. I'm guessing you're Vallir, but I wouldn't mind meeting your friends either.""Well, nice to hear that. Most people groan at that one.""What can I say, I'm a friendly guy.""Chatted with Thor for a while, interesting topics came up, she suggested I go talk to you while she sobers up and thinks about life.""Really? It's that easy to pique your interest?" *He says a bit teasingly*"You might be pleasantly surprised. The stupid outfit, name, and helmet aren't just a halloween gag, after all.""[okay...]" *She says, switching back to speaking Japanese*"The helmet doesn't, but the rest might depending on how tonight goes."*He shrugs and says* "I'm giving the odds a 50/50.""Yep. So, what do you like? I don't really know much about you except your name and Thor's 'experiences' with you.""I'm glad you like it, I'm free for standup on Tuesdays and Saturdays." *He says jokingly*"Nice to hear. Now, let's get wasted and forget our problems."[end here, or want to skip to some later point in time?][okay! Skoll talked to Thor for a while then she kind of set him up with her old girlfriend. Not Hati, like her first girlfriend ever.][your welcome!]"Gack! Why is nothing ever good here?" *She tries rubbing her hands together to neutralize it somewhat* [twi I just realized we have to rewind. I forgot she only has one hand]*She makes her way towards him, tossing things haphazardly as she goes. She stumbles a bit, but it doesn't seem to bother her much**She looks at them, and does eeny-meeny-miny-moe. She ends up with the blue one, she still stores the red one in her shorts in case she decides she likes red more later**Yes**She tries rubbing it on herself to warm her hand up**She does so, breathing on her hand to try to warm it up*"Blech.""Ever thought of putting glass on the ceiling, making it a greenhouse kind of?"*Lilith is gorging herself as usual, she seems to prefer the mashed potatoes and cranberries* "Would that work or am I being an idiot?"*I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE**She is smiling a bit less and shaking a bit more*"Sweet. Plus it would probably be great for tanning.""Cozy!" *She begins to look around, being wise enough to try not walking under the chandelier directly*"Fashion designer? Cool, I just saved a fashion show on earth from some crazy guy a week or two back."*She is getting annoyed with all this running, but the terrifying part is that she doesn't seem tired in the slightest. As she nears the body, her foot comes down right on top of, and subsequently right through its chest with a sickening crunch and squish*"I'm fine!"*She most certainly does not look or sound fine*"Ya, he was planning on blowing the place and all the models sky high if they didn't give him some prize. Also all the money in the building of course.""Ab-so-lutely!""So?!""Why not?""Think I need it?"*She pouts at him, but her scarf covers it*"Nah, I just like helping people.""Maybe..."*Her veneer of stability kind of collapses as she hugs back and cries a fair bit*"Thank god someone thinks so, I was almost to the point of putting a wig on a pink motorcycle helmet." *He says jokingly* *He does as well, under his helmet.*"Sure."*He takes it with a bit of flourish* "Where to?""That's a bit of a complicated situation. How about yours?""That works.""If you say so."*She seems intent on crying and incoherently babbling for a bit*"[insert hotel name here!]"[want to just fade/skip to next morning?][well, I kind of figured that was where it was going with the hotel and everything, but if they are just going to talk I would like to do that]"You'd look even better."*She eventually seems to calm down slightly*[oh... I don't think I know it then..?][okaaaay. Sorry for the misunderstanding!]*Skoll is, inexplicably, brushing his teeth in the bathroom after a shower. He's somehow still wearing the helmet*"Mhm." *It seems to have changed style a bit, allowing him to slide the visor up enough to brush his teeth.*"No way. That's a style in Japan, you know. Girls with light hair and tan skin."*He finishes brushing and fairly jokingly says says* "Thanks, it takes some getting used to but at least I don't need to worry about random slips trips and falls."*She shrugs* "It depends. Some of them can't pull it off but I think you could if you wanted to.""Hopefully the owner won't mind replacing the headboard. And the boxspring. And the bed frame in general.""I'll chip in too, I'd feel like an asshole otherwise.""Oh come on, don't be like that. Don't I look good with dark skin and bright hair?""Oh come on, don't make me beg." *He says teasingly*"Ya, you see what I mean? You can totally pull it off then.""Ack! I am not for the shooting!" *She begins fleeing around frantically while looking for where the bolt came from*"Is that a promise?"*She frowns a bit at the nevermind* "Were you going to say something else just then?"[skip again?]*She looks at her, seeming obviously unbelieving of the answer*[like what?]"I kind of feel like you're changing the subject.""A fair bit less horrible than everyone else. And rejected by who?""So what? He was probably an asshole anyway if he rejected you." "Nah, you are. Even I can tell that and I'm totally inept at this kind of thing.""Why not?""Why?""That's a poor reason."*Now might be a good time to say something*"What makes you think anyone else has a happier life?"[alright. I was kind of hoping some time in the morning they could get to know each other better, but we can have that happen after their... romp.]"Then change your situation, not who you are.""Not really."[okay! skipping to a fair bit of time later]

*Skoll is now lying on the mostly trashed bed, somehow smoking a cigarette with his helmet still on*"Yes it is.""I recall some begging on both sides.""I'd rather thank you than blame you.""What's a word better than great? Because I think great's not good enough for you. Asgard must be awesome.""Hey! Go away robot man! I am not for shooting!" *She waves her fist angerly at him as she tries, unsuccessfully, to find a place to hide*"What's it like?" "Oh! Magic, good!" *She swings again, this time actually aiming instead of kind of flailing*"Do all the girls look like you?""Is it?""I don't know what to do...""I can buy that. So does that mean no hot sisters?""Why did you swing at me?""Why?"*He grins under his helmet*"Who, me? Please, I would never." *He says half-jokingly* "And?""Thank you~""But I don't want to do nothing!""And so you tried to hurt me?""So, wanna get some breakfast?""Sweet." *He gets out of bed, his clothes appearing back on his body. He's out of his halloween costume and wearing his usual white jacket now*"So, when people hurt you you're supposed to hurt them?" *She is quiet for a bit**She suddenly pops off of him, standing up straight and smiling with her wicked jagged teeth*may I do Tuesday and Thursday meals and the pvp? "Same to you, like the outfit." *He jokes*"Thank you sparky! Things make a lot more sense now!""Alright, any preference?" thank you!"So... Do something..?""Things! When somebody hurts you, you hurt them! It's simple!""Baked goods, fruits, sweets, bacon, sausage- you can probably cross that last one off the checklist in your case you've probably had enough for now.""Alright, if you're good then later." *He says teasingly*"We're going to run out of beds eventually.""But why not?""That'll come in handy if I ever visit. Which reminds me, think you'd like to do this again and if so with or without a date beforehand? I'm really fine whichever way you pick.""Alright, we can talk about it after breakfast. I'm pretty sure this place has a restaurant on the first floor.""This way then." *He puts an arm around her waist and leads the way to the restaurant.*"That doesn't make sense!""So?"*He gets them a table, though the waiter seems a bit offput by Skoll's strange appearance*"I want to hurt somebody who hurt me! Hurting bad people is okay!""That depends on how a lot of things go.""Mostly relationship things.""Why is that important?""That's good to hear, I was a bit worried you just wanted me for my helmet and my anatomy that shares its name with a breakfast food.""Why should it matter to you if Thor hurt me?""A big one too."*She seems a bit confused by him suddenly leaving* "Hey! Tell me!"*He seems proud under his mask*"So, what're you thinking of for breakfast? I'm going to get a smoothie." "Real? Why wouldn't I be real?" *She sounds offended*"Waffles. Tasty and memetic." "Good choice."*She looks offended by the accusation* "I am Hati!"*When the waiter arrives he orders their meals* "From what I hear, ya.""That's a bit of a complicated story. Probably goes further back than me to be honest."*She pouts at him*"Yep. Like I said, not relation to the myth *probably*.""I don't really know enough about Asgardian history to say.""Mind doing a study date some time?" *He says jokingly* "Sounds like it'll still work fine for me.""Sparky! Why are you so grumpy?""What though!""Tell me them!""Why not?"*She pouts, but with her current mouth it looks a bit terrifying*"What? Also why?"*Their meals arrive, he uses a straw to sip his smoothie* "Try putting syrup on it. And butter."*She pouts a bit under her scarf**Trish is a freelance back-alley doctor, doing medical work for people who don't want to be found.*

*Hati is barely classifiable as medical personnel, more like equipment. She searches the cities for the wounded and the sick and delivers them to doctors.*

*Skoll is a surgeon, using his powers to summon surgical equipment seemingly out of thin air. Nobody knows why he wears a helmet.*

*Bernard is a veterinarian for both pets and farm animals and even exotic beasts, though he also treats humans once in a long while*

*Akki is an orderly and a nurse, depending on her mood.*

*Dolly can't really do anything because she has no hands*

*Carnelia is probably worse, and likely steals then sells medical supplies. She is bad.**He continues drinking, waiting for her reaction*"Then tell me!""Ack!" *She runs to the edge while trying to fire a small roof to cover her*"I'm no good at planning.""Yes!"*He chuckles**Okay! doing what..?*"I didn't realize earth food would be so impressive compared to asgardian food.""Why?"*Oh... He probably wouldn't be very conversational*"Sounds great."*Okay!*"Most humans do.""Both!"*Alright! Skoll is standing outside of the operating room, his outfit a pristine white again despite having had blood splatters on it not five minutes ago. He looks relieved, even with his mask that's obvious* "I am...?""Is it spit roasted?" "Damn, I was about to make a fantastic pun.""Am I... Your only friend...?""Hm? Nah, that's just our job. You feeling alright?""Am I...?""Well, I wouldn't have guessed that you're a fan of spit roasts.""Ha! I didn't realize you liked me *that* much.""You can do the job and you do it well, that's enough in my eyes.""But I am not your only one?""It's good to know though. I'll get back to you on that when I figure out cloning.""Sure, if you've got an appetite right now.""Oh, that's okay...""Well, someone's sounding a bit greedy.""Thanks. I'm really liking you so far too." *He sounds more sincere than usual*"Alright, some people don't after surgery.""Sure!""Yessir!""Ha! Let's just go get fast food or something.""What?""Sure thing.""Yay!" *She does so**He just waits, apparently already clean**She hugs tightly, but not enough to hurt*"Ack!" *She tries doing so, and in a panic fires more ice at the wave of shards**His clothes suddenly turn into a normal white jacket and pants*"No problem Sparky!""What do you think?""Oh, that's nice." *She comments to herself before firing another blast at the metal man*"So... What were you talking about planning?"*He grins under his mask*"How?""Well, we could just get fast food.""Well, I think you can do it! I don't support it, but I think you can do it!""Well, got any better ideas?""IHOP?" *The moment is a bit ruined by him slurping the smoothie*"Why's that?""Why?""Hm?"*She pouts at that answer*"Well, that's too bad."*He finishes the remains of his smoothie fairly quickly* "Mind if I have some?""Close enough, Red Hood from batman. Just not red.""Megaman zero, unless I'm too drunk to remember my retro characters. Which would be weird since I've had like, two beers.""But I don't think it's True."*He begins snacking on the waffles*"Wait until you try muffins.""Character's still retro. ish."*He laughs a bit*"Don't worry, you'd still look pretty cute. And we can probably order one here.""Nice sword. Also at this point basically anything pre-2008 is being called 'retro', it's a little weird.""I meant what I said and I said what I meant.""Because then I would have gotten hurt and lied to and betrayed and then just left! Those things still happened!"*He laughs* "Try not to make yourself sick.""Never said it made sense, people are weird.""Sure. You want me to describe what some of these things are or you just want to go in blind?" *He says as he opens the menu*"As you wish." *He says, grinning under his mask as he orders a laundry list of different foods.**He tells her what each one is and occasionally picks bits off. He actually looks pretty impressed.**He laughs* "You joke, but some people are really like that.""You're pretty determined about this.""The allure of the baked goods is stronger?""Most of them are online."*She growls a bit in annoyance*"So. Wanna see something cool?""So. Wanna see something cool?""Well, as long as you aren't getting to the point where I need to wheel you around" *He says teasingly*"I'll be here as the voice of lax and occasional reason then.""Can the hero have a kiss?" *He asks semi-jokingy*"Watch closely." *He holds his hands about a foot apart, and a bright shifting light appears and begins to shape itself between them*"And when did I say I wanted Thor back?""Is this close enough?" *He says, his helmet shifting to a model that leaves most of his face below the bridge of his nose uncovered* "Tease.""It's a complicated issue. Want to go back to eating your pancakes and discuss it later?""Ah-ah-ah, one sec-" *The shape begins to solidify, and then he reaches a hand in an pulls out a glowing freshly-forged imitation of the z-saber*"Good." *His helmet goes back to normal as he stabs a piece of pancake with his fork and holds it up to her mouth*"I just... I don't know! I wanna do something right now!""Thank you, thank you, I also do standup and card tricks." *He says jokingly*"You sure you'll be able to finish all this?""Ya but other things! Big things!""That might work for now...""Sorry, they don't last very long once I put them down." *To demonstrate, he holds the handle out towards her so she can take it*"Wow, Asgardian feasts must be impressive."*It is remarkably well balanced, and beautifully crafted. It would likely work as an actual sword. After a few seconds, however, it suddenly 'poofs' out of existence in a puff of twinkling lights* "If so... How many chubby people are there in Asgard? Or do you all do workouts and stuff to deal with it?""Huh. Didn't really expect that.""Yep. I'm working on making them last longer.""Eep!" *She is a bit surprised by the portal but, with some trepidation, walks through it*"No deal, sorry.""Well, the choice is up to you!"*She pats him on the head*"Ya, but the mask doesn't come off.""Hm?""Alright. So, to the IHOP?"*She decides to follow him in the party for the time being*"Uh...?""I've got a motorcycle.""Oh! Sparky?" *She picks him up and shakes him a bit**She shrugs and decides to carry him to a hospital**He makes his way to the parking lot and to a beautifully designed and fancy-looking white and silver motorcycle*"Yep. Friend of mine made it for me."[you spelled it wrong.]

*The dog lounges but takes the mallet right to the face, going off course and slamming into one of the purrifiers coming back from the beach. Meanwhile, in the bushes, Lilith finally manages to get a good grip on the dog and crush some of the vital parts of its skull. One of the last people in the cars comes out, it appears to be one of the Chile soldiers, laser gun and all.*

/u/Trevosutto 

[as a serious note, we need to think of what to do. this is *the last day* to get this done and we don't even have the whole team in the base.]*She doesn't notice, heat doesn't really effect her* *He does so* "You have a helmet, or do you wanna use my spare?""Hello Sparky!""No worries." *He holds his hands together and a helmet seemingly appears.* "Here you go. Just don't go too far, if you do it'll disappear.""Okay, I'll be quiet!""I'll drive slow so you can stay on more easily."*She happily rushes to the hospital*"I know. You ever think of getting a prosthetic?""Yep!""I just think it might come in handy once in a while. No pun intended."*She shrugs*"Well, it's your choice.""Got it." *He starts the engine and begins driving slowly and carefully to IHOP*"Hm?""No it's not?"*He doesn't mind*"Just be careful not to fall off."*She doesn't let go, and shakes him a bit* "Bad Sparky!""Sparky don't make me bite you!" *She says with a pout while passing him off to the people with the stretcher**They arrive at the IHOP fairly quickly*"Yay! He calmed down!"*He laughs a bit* "First time riding a motorcycle?"*She waits patiently in the waiting room, eventually taking a nap*"Well, you can ride it again after lunch. or dinner. I don't keep track sometimes.""Ya, can't wait to get a long night's rest.""Ack! Emergency evasive maneuvers!" *She begins fleeing around wildly and firing blasts randomly as she panics* "Oh! What's up with Sparky?""So, getting anything special or just pancakes?""Oh! Why'd he do that?""Ditto, I'm not in the mood for anything complicated."IC: *Lilith writes PEOPLE WHO FIGHT FROM FAR FAR AWAY*

OOC: uuuuum... In that case probably French because I speak some French or Germany because I am proud of my heritage! *Lilith seems intent on eating her whole day's worth of food in smoothies alone, but keeps getting brain freezes* [I really don't think that will help. Given our current speed, there's no way we'll get done fast enough.]*They get a seat and he orders pancakes*"Is he awake?"*She looks confused at all the storm troopers*"Which one of you?""Ha! That is the power of the esteemed Cambel family!""This one? Just a few months.""Yay! Can I see him?""Ya, I guess my expectations where effected by myths and such. Which is weird since I know the myths aren't right."*She waves back, then clutches her head again as she gets another smoothie.*"Oh! That's useful!" *She goes forth, deciding to take off the cold glove. Her victory was making her feel more adventurous, red is better for an adventure.*"Got it, kind of expected as much but I'll try to not bring them up then.""Cool. Sorry about that.""Yes ma'am!" *She skips down the hall to his room*"Didn't. I'm just starting.""Hello!""What can I say, I'm good at making friends.""How are you feeling, Sparky?""Well, it's nice to know that.""Something wrong?""Oh! A nurse can go get you some water then.""What do you mean?"*He shrugs* "We can just talk about normal stuff. What do you like to do? Outside of work I mean.""Hey! Off! Bad glove!" *She tries to pull it off with her teeth as she keep going forth*"Why are there so many clone troopers?""If you're good with your spare time.""Ya, because you wouldn't calm down when I told you too! I just wanted to bite you to calm you down but they used medicine instead.""Think a croissant would help make up for it?" *He asks, holding one up to her*"Any particular reason why?""Yep!" *She suddenly grows wolf ears instead of normal ones*"Like stage magic or real magic?""Alright, just don't touch anything in it." *He takes out a white flip phone*"I think I know which one it'll be from that answer.""Probably not?""I like old tech, tech used to have style. Also, neat trick."*He heard it quite well* "No worries, it wasn't that bad.""Why would you hurt me?"*She eventually pouts at it* "Fine, if you will not cooperate, I will still not be deprived of my red." *She attempts to slip the other glove on over the first one*"Sure.""So?""But *why* would you hurt me? I am a good Hati!"*Soon enough their food arrives*"It's a funny hammer!""Hey, my mic works just fine." *He says, holding the phone up closer to make it easier to hear him**He sighs* "And this is what I get for trying to be nice." *He suddenly flips the phone closed**He chuckles a bit and opens it up again* "So, would you mind putting my stuff back? Sorry for the sudden blackout.""Why are you all in the same costume?""Nice.""Oh! Why are you in that costume too then?""Mostly. How long do you intend to stay in there?""Sweet trick, and fitting costume.""But didn't you just say they suck for having that costume?""I feel like this was the better choice.""Skoll, yours?"*She looks confused now*"Nice to meet you. Alex." *Her offers her a handshake*"So, you liking the party?""Don't worry, drunk people are weird but give them their space and they're pretty harmless. Some of them can be funny too."*She pouts a bit*"Oh! Purple, perfect for a regal lady like myself!"*Still pouting*"Sure."[I'm not sure, ask for more time maybe..?]"I still don't get it.""Oooooh! But doesn't this kind of make it better?"*She began searching for the nearest person to fight, since her current opponent seems to have run off*

/u/Zorrekky and /u/Acciosun you may want to show up now. Lilith is blinded but Ditto ran off, she accidentally killed one of his duplicates while blinded."But aren't the clones supposed to be in an army?""Well, that's good to hear. I was about to have to resort to Italian wedding cookies.""So it's good that there's an army of you here!""You should lead the army!""Why?""Why?"*Even in her currently blinded state, Lilith manages to navigate the forest moderately well in an attempt to find Katja by following her voice*

/u/Zorrekky "And?"[don't forget to tag!]*He grins and holds one of the small cookies up to her*[if you have not had those before, they are wonderful.]

"Like it?""Why?"*Lilith makes her way to Katja, she's covered in a large amount of blood but no cuts. She seems to be stumbling around a bit, like she can't see where she's going.*

/u/Zorrekky[what order will we all go in now?]

/u/Acciosun
/u/Zorrekky [well, there's not really any way parts of that will work or that we'll finish this in time, but I guess I'll just go along with it so we can get as much done as we can...] 

*While he can't really pull Lilith in any way whatsoever, she does start to come along on her own. She also swings a punch at the Chile soldier as she is taking aim, knocking her out. The other one begins to work her radio, it might be a good idea to stop that.*

/u/Trevosutto"Great, because there's more." [want to skip to when she's done?]"I have a hammer?""Hm?"[okay!]

"Wow, that was downright impressive."*He claps his hands*"You eat like that often?"*She pouts a bit at this answer**She seems confused now*"Oh! Skoll!""I don't get it!""Just remember to take it easy once in a while."*More pouting*"So, where to now? Unless you need to get back to Asgard.""Alright, any idea when we can see each other again? I kind of doubt they've got Skype in Asgard. Though if they do that's fucking amazing.""Does it work with earth skype?"*This pouting probably isn't possible by normal humans at this point**Not stopping* "Stop it!""Being so mean to yourself!""Then stop! You're my friend and I hit people who are mean to my friends!"*Lilith seems intent on finishing off the few remaining soldiers here, motioning for him to go ahead. She then, in a move likely surprising to most of the people who know her, picks up two of the rifles from dead purifiers, opening fire. It seems to have surprised them too, because the Chile soldier and the one coming back from the beach both get gunned down. The other dog is getting back up from its earlier tumble, and she prepares to fight it. Psycho should probably go in, she can handle this.*

/u/Trevosutto [you know we're not here for prisoners, right..? He's just supposed to plug the USB into the main computer.]*She raises her hand threateningly while pouting*[order will be Lilith, Katja, Ditto, Ichor then?]

*Lilith has no means to communicate, which seems to be distressing her. She suddenly stops her general distress and begins looking around though, apparently sniffing the air. The blood on her made this difficult, but she could definitely smell a hint of someone nearby.*

/u/AccioSun "Only if I felt like hitting myself!"[please link correctly next time, and also see https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiHeroRP/comments/3qcu6r/the_coastal_infiltration/cwmaexo ][yes, but my point is that there *isn't* a prison as far as we know and as far as the mods have told us, I would rather not complicate and prolong the mission any further with a rescuing prisoners subplot]"The rules are made to be broken!"*Lilith, outside, has begun wrestling the damaged dog into submission as another patrol begins to approach from the distance, she notices and tries to end the fight quickly before grabbing another two guns and heading into the base*

Not that I don't like your company, in fact it's pretty awesome, but we might not always have the time for a rendezvous. Or the spare beds.""Alright, good to know. I try not to be a pest unless someone asks me to.""Oh? Who to?" *He asks with a grin**Lilith makes her way through the halls, making more noise than is probably a good idea but also taking out several soldiers with powerful strikes as they round corners. She takes their weapons with her as she goes, and by the time she bursts into the main computer room about a minute later she has a nice collection of at least five rifles and one of the laser rifles. She nods a greeting to the other two. Meanwhile, near the entrance, the trashed patrol has been found, and Purifiers are starting to search the base. Lilith puts down two of her guns to write on a piece of paper WHAT NOW?*

/u/Trevosutto"Now now, not in public~" *He teases*"Ya, but you told me to be a pest." *He grins under his mask*"Is that a threat or a promise?""Now, don't be mean to yourself or I'll hit you!""Now who's being a pest?""Fair point, but one that might need punishing later.""I thought you said you needed to get back. Although, if you don't, we don't need to be out of the room until noon.""We could test the limits of that statement.""Yay! How about this idea, any time you want to be mean to yourself just be mean to me instead!""I'll lead the way." *He smiles and leaves a fairly large amount of cash on the table to pay for the meal, then begins to walk back to their room*[want to skip to afterwords, or perhaps when she goes back to Asgard?][sorry...][okaaay...]

Be sure to asgard-skype me once you get the chance." *His helmet shifts to the model that doesn't cover his mouth* "A kiss before you you, or would the helmet make it weird?""Why not?""Aww.""But I don't know anyone named Ralph!"*She pouts at him again*"What other me?"*She raises her hand again*"Sparky you aren't making sense.

* After Nightshade went back to sleep Liv and cutout showed up and offered to help get supplies and such

* after they left Victor the immortal showed up and tried to kidnap Nightshade, leading to a fight with Trish, leading to his death. Nightshade berated Trish for it and Liv tried, and failed, to comfort her.

* Trish went to mope in the desert and talked to Johnny for a bit, they had a brotherly/sisterly moment and she felt a bit better about the whole ordeal. [just write your character's reaction to it and possibly go to talk to their friends/family.

Why is Mr.Spooky lounging about? He was supposed to be helping me!" *She angerly shakes her one fist at the waterfall with Boogeyman*"Yech. Mr.Spooky you will have to find me a nice beach after this." *She snuggles on the ground by the water again for a few seconds, then gets up to walk into the Boogeyman waterfall*"oh ya!

Of course from here we need to kind of think of what Hati and Skoll are. Speaking of, what's the common knowledge in Asgard about those two?][oh. alright, I will try to think some thingies up then][well, unless he wakes up again soon Hati would have probably wandered off][the first battle event will be up in a day or two, he doesn't have the names and such yet]"So, desert?""I'll get a milkshake, you?"*Lilith writes AREN'T THERE WAY MORE OF THEM THEN THERE ARE OF US?*

What flavor did you get anyway?"[oh... that is probably bad.

*Eventually, after a while of searching, Skoll sat down in an alley, tired from walking so much for so many days straight* 

"Jesus, how hard can a girl be to find?" 

"Who're we looking for?" *Hati says, jumping down to sit beside him*

"Some girl named-" *He looks at her, falling silent. She stares at her own reflection in his helmet and waves* "Well, you know what they say it's always in the last place you look."

"Oh! Did we find somethign! Also who are you?"

"Skoll, I'm-"

"SKOOOOLL!" *She tacklehugs him and begins repeating his name while cuddling uncomfortably tight* 

"WHOA! Hati, could you back off a bit...? I was kind of looking forward to winning the 'most intact lungs' award today."

"Okay!" *She pops off, she now has a tail which is wagging happily*

"Thanks, I'll be sure to mention you in my acceptance speech. Now, if you don't mind think you could take something off my hands for me?" *He takes a letter out of his jacket*

"Sure! Is it edible?"

"I mean, probably, but Thor would be upset if you didn't read it first"

"THOOOOOR!" *She grabs it in a flash* "I need to read this in private, see you later best brother ever!" *She hugs him again and zips off*

"Hey, wait! Shit... Well, at least I can fuck off and go do work now."

*Meanwhile, Hati runs off to open and read the letter* 

/u/Sir_Willis_CMS *Hati, in an abandoned building, is looking at the letter in shock. Her perspective on it is likely... Different from what Thor intended. She sees it as "you messed up I don't like you anymore it was a mistake to start going out with you good luck with life so long PS kill my sister so I can go date someone else". Hati grits her teeth as she begins to increase in temperature, rapidly heating until she combusts into nearly white flames.* "All this... After all the things I DID?" *She puts her fist right through the wall, punching molten bricks away* "When I was THERE FOR HER?" *She kicks a metal support, the metal rapidly heating and bending* "*This* Is what I get?" *She ignites the paper, burning it to ash in seconds.* "She told me I was special! That I was her only FRIEND!" *Her silver armor disappears, and her hair is let loose again, turning her back to her old appearance.* "You don't just LIE about things like that!" *Her teeth grow and sharpen to razor-point daggers.* "I got fucking LIED TO AGAIN!" *She grows small horns from her forehead, and a burning chain collar appears around her neck again* "I HATE LIARS AND CHEATS AND PHONIES AND-" *She stops her small rampage for a few moments as a large grin spreads on her face* "Tricksters... No, I don't hate those ones. I *like* tricks." *Her voice sounds maliciously amused. Her fires die down a bit, reverting to an immense body temperature. Her horns are hidden behind her hair, and she wraps her scarf around her mouth. A pair of headphones appear on her head, blaring music into her ears.*  "I have plenty of people to go see.""Well, nice to know."[that's all for here, but it will certainly continue later.]"What? Of course not. You're fucking gorgeous, and don't say anything like 'but my eyes' that stuff looks awesome. Plus it's probably someone's kink.""Lots of guys like that stuff, and girls too. Plus your hair is great.""And?""Want help with that?" *She has a small grin*"What, I can figure out how hair dye works! Probably.""Oh, pretty!" *She begins crawling closer*"What..?"*She props herself up and attempts to take the gloves, they look pretty and comfy*"No, I'm your friend and you promised to let me help you.""If you say so..." *She looks a bit upset*"Really? What would I wear?""When's the party gonna be?""I said when, 'Shade.""Oh shit, I need to go get ready."IC: *Lilith writes SPOOKY GHOST OR SKELETON*

OOC: uuuuum... Does The Nightmare Before Christmas count?"Well, we could go costume shopping together!""Sweet, let's go!"*She begins leading the way to the nearest store selling costumes, probably a party store*"I'm sure you'd do great, but I don't know if we've got the time. Think you could do it that fast?""Well, I could get one while you go make one if you like."*Skoll has, surprisingly, shown up. His costume seems to be that of the [Red Hood](http://img03.deviantart.net/a568/i/2011/301/a/1/red_hood_colored_by_tengukarasu-d4e7sp3.jpg) from batman, but all white and grey and with the usual mask swapped out for a normal white motorcycle helmet* "Sorry, best I could come up with on short notice.""Alright, see you at the party!" 


[end?]*Someone shows up in an obviously store-bought but still rather elegant and well-fitting [vampire outfit](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8/221790308/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8.jpg), complete with pale makeup and a bit of fake blood near the edge of their mouth. They look... Familiar, but with the makeup the person (probably a guy? hard to tell with those features) is difficult to identify. Whoever he is, his most striking feature is probably the long flowing white hair that goes nearly halfway down his back.*"Skoll, nice to meet you. I've heard a bit about you but not much, I'm the guy Jack asked to deliver the letter." *He holds out his hand for a handshake**Hati shows up, though it seems to have been on accident, she just wandered on. Small horns poke out from her messy hair, and her appearance seems far closer to its original one. She has her scarf pulled up over her mouth**They smile at her, and a- rather familiar- voice responds* "Oh, what's up 'Shade? The party's going great!" *That... Is not a guy. In fact it seems to be Trish.*"No problem. Finally got it to her recently by the way, but she ran off before I could say anything to her.""Nah, plenty of people will come, don't worry.""Seriously? Sorry about that...""Ya, you're pretty well liked around here. And don't frown so much, your smile looks great.""Well, that's good. Plus your apartment seems to have gotten cleaned up fairly fast, so at least you weren't on the street or anything.""Nice, powers rock. So, any particular reason Hati is being such a nuisance?" "Why'd she go after *you* then?"*Skoll, in what looks like a white biker outfit, shows up to the party. He's still in his helmet*"I'm going to assume from the number of y's in that that you're either really drunk or really like bikers. I'm kind of guessing the first one. Also, sup?""Got it, jealous ex. Psychopathic jealous ex. Is there any reason that she basically tackled me when she heard my name?""Well, first time ever having a superheroine and also kind of god compliment me, that's pretty flattering.""No I mean Hati. I said I was "Skoll" and she tackled me and hugged tight enough that I probably won't be winning any intact-ribcage contests for a while.""Oh. Sorry, I couldn't find a girl costume that fit and also didn't look like a stripper outfit." *She doesn't seem to realize what was so upsetting about the mixup*"So are you two together then?""Fair point. And don't take this the wrong way, but I probably wouldn't go after you at the moment either, you're hotter than a napalm bombshell but between the breakup and the alcohol there's no way that taking advantage of the situation wouldn't be a dick move."*She turns to look at him, and it's obvious from her eyes and cheeks that she's smiling even if her mouth can't be seen* "Hiiiiiiii Johnny!""That's what people tell me. How much have you had to drink anyway?""You alright? I don't know how much asgardians can drink but I'm taking a wild guess at saying it probably isn't literally infinite.""I guess..." *He sounds a bit unsure.*"I don't know. She's unpredictable, but I don't think everything's really *random*. It might not make sense but I think there's a plan in this whole thing somewhere.""How's it goin?" *She walks over, her gait a bit odd and... slippery? The way she weaves back and forth as she walks looks almost serpentine* "Don't worry, I got this-" *He pulls a straw out of his jacket and slides the visor on his helmet up just enough to slip one end in, it looks odd but it works. He takes a drink then says* "And I don't know for sure, I don't know her well enough."*She looks over at him, and smiles under her scarf* "Hiiiiii Sparky!""What do you mean by off?" *She tilts her head... a bit too far. Not supernaturally, but it looks uncomfortable.*"I've been fine! How about youuuu?" *She doesn't comment on it*"I don't think so! Probably.""Hey, if it's that bad I can just swap into my usual clothes." *She seems a bit sad about Nightshade's reaction to her outfit*"Oh! Why'd you break your nose?""I move how I want to!""I've only met her a single time now. She sure acts otherwise, though.""Exactly. That's why I want to figure her out.""Oh! Why did it do that?""Soooooo how've you been?""Huh...? Oh. Oooooh." *She blushes as well, but it's mostly hidden by her makeup* "So... I look good then..?"*She pouts*"I take it you don't like my odds?""Hm? I'm handsome? Also you didn't answer my question before!""That's... pretty flattering actually.""Well, at least I've got three people cheering me on in this.""Don't worry about it, you didn't know so it doesn't count or something, right?""I forget!" *She smiles again under her scarf*"Nice costume by the way, it's awesome that you made one so fast."*She pouts at him* "Stop being so grumpy, Sparky!""It would help if those three weren't me, myself, and I though.""Didn't you just say I didn't have a chance?" *He grins under his mask, and his voice shows it*"Thanks. So, what kind of drinks have you got here?""You sure it's okay to be wearing it? I don't want you getting sick from a dirty mask or anything.""Good! Did you get over your bad breakup?""Oh! Nevermind then, you seemed kind of grumpy." *She goes back to her cheery self*"Good, the desert community of liv-er will be thankful for your generosity." *He continues with his drink*"Yay! Who was it anyway?""Oh! Who?""I can hold my alcohol.""Alright, I'm just a bit worried about you sometimes. You were a nightmare of a patient last time." *She says with a bit of a laugh, remembering her refusing to take medicine* "I am?""First one to vomit and pass out then wake up in a stranger's bed loses?" *He says jokingly before taking another sip* "Though I suppose that last part has a chance of counting as a win.""It's nice to plan ahead. Mind if the creepy motorcycle guy knows? Don't want to hit on anyone who's off-limits after all.""Which one?""I'm way too young to be your mom, Nightshade.""Alright, just making sure."*She stops, freezing in place for a few seconds, then her head slowly turns to lock eyes with him* "...Really?" "Oh! I don't think I'm touchy. Am I?""Well... I didn't mind taking care of you. Even if I'm not your mom or whatever.""No prob." *She smiles, revealing the fake fangs she's wearing with the costume*"Well, I can't tell you that, it's my secret identity." *He says playfully*"How so?""Say no more, I'll keep my distance. Need a wingman by any chance?" *Someone shows up in an obviously store-bought but still rather elegant and well-fitting [vampire outfit](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8/221790308/HTB11vZjGXXXXXcdXFXXq6xXFXXX8.jpg), complete with pale makeup and a bit of fake blood near the edge of their mouth. They look... Familiar, but with the makeup the person (probably a guy? hard to tell with those features) is difficult to identify. Whoever he is, his most striking feature is probably the long flowing white hair that goes nearly halfway down his back.**She pouts at him again*"What can I say, it's a gift and a curse this razor wit of mine.""Alright, I'll cheer you on from the side, waving pom-poms then."*The person looks over and waves back, then speaks in a familiar- and more than moderately feminine- voice* "So, you showed up too?" *It seems that that is actually Trish*"Aw, don't feel bad. I use humor to conceal my 'deep and traumatic character backstory'" *He says jokingly**He laughs* "Alright, you're flying solo then."*That makes her happy*"Still, I could give a snap-preview, you're drunk enough that it'll probably be a shoddy memory at best." *He looks both ways to check if anyone is paying attention, then quickly flips up his reflective visor, revealing [his eyes and a very small bit of his face](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9y26Qv4s1ql5h4t.jpg).*"What, did you expect somebody else?""So, mind if I ask you a question?" *His voice seems to have gotten more serious, and a bit quieter to signal her to get a bit closer so they won't be as easily overheard*"But I like being cute!""Oh ya almost forgot those! I had to do a lot of this costume, you would not believe how long it took to get my hair this straight"*He jokingly puts a finger over where his mouth would be and shushes her as he flips the visor back down*"Oh. Ya, lots of people aren't recognizing me like this.""Yay!""Hm?""Like what? Unless you aren't supposed to tell them, in which case I don't want to be the reason you feel guilty in the morning. Well, guilty for other reasons maybe but I'd feel guilty too in those situations.""Thanks, ditto. It was a bit weird to have Nightshade hit on me though.""Thanks.." *She sounds a bit flattered and embarrassed* "Yaaaaay!""Yep, my biggest secret, given away. Whatever will I do?" *He says jokingly as he grabs a drink, sticks a straw under his visor, and begins to drink while they chat*"She doesn't, she thought I was a guy.""Need any help getting to a bed or something?""It was... Flattering, but strange.""Alright." *He offers her a hand to help her over there.*"What do you mean?""Ya, me too... Wanna get some fresh air or something?"*He helps walk her over to the couch, also making sure there's not too much of a mess on it*"Not at the moment. Also, lie on your side in case you pass out. It would suck if a goddess choked to death on her own vomit."*She freezes, stops her revelry, and slowly turns her head to look him in the eyes**She seems a bit annoyed and embarrassed at the implication, even as a joke.*"God dammit why does everyone assume I'm a lesbian?""I thought only kids under three could choke on small parts?" *He says in a bit of self-deprecative humor* "In all seriousness though I'm flattered, and definitely think of calling me when you're not too drunk to stand right.""How's Thor doing?""It's getting old, everyone's like that."*She walks out of the church a bit so they can get away from the party for a minute or two.* "I love nights like this, autumn air feels great.""Thanks. So, you staying conscious or no?""Do not talk about that, Sparky.""It seems to be to everyone else.""Good, I actually had a couple questions.""Really? It's always way too hot out in summer.""Because it happens all the time! I'm tired of that being the first thing people think about me.""Because I said not to!" *She smiles, but it looks a bit too manic**He sighs* "I'm probably gonna ruin the mood. I need to know about Hati.""Not me. Last summer it was so hot I spent most of the day in my room in my boxers.""Just... A lot of things. Like why she tackled me and seemed overjoyed when she heard my name even though we've never met.""You'd be surprised."*She pokes his nose twice* "Touchy touchy!""Alright... I'm worried about her. She seems like she's pretty messed up after what happened.""And? Does she buy into all that or something?"*She sighs* "Still, not your fault, sorry I snapped at you.""Anyway, nice costume.""None taken. So she follows along with all the old earth myths?"*She seems confused by his reaction, having completely forgotten that that would hurt*"You here with anybody?""Sad, but maybe useful."*She steps out of the way fairly easily* "Hey! What was that for?""Cool, I got to meet her recently. She thought I was challenging her to a race for some reason.""I'm trying to figure her out. The things she does seem unpredictable, but I don't think they're random. I want to figure her out so maybe I can stop her from hurting anyone else." "I hope so. It's kinda strange, a heroine and goddess and it turns out she's just as fragile as the rest of us.""We did? When?""I would have won if it was.""Anything else you can tell me that might help that? Weird things she does?""Got it. Rest up, I'd rather you be feeling fine and I have to wait a bit longer to figure this out than the other way around."*She pouts* "Hati is not  bad!""Why did you break up...?"*She grins* "I'll try.""Want me to get you some water or something?"*She growls at him*"Well, nice to see everyone smiling, this is a party after all.""One sec." *He goes to get a glass of water for her**He comes back with the glass* "Drink slow, and try not to puke unless you really have to.""Anyway, I'm gonna go make sure Nightshade isn't eating or drinking strange things, see you around."*She lets her scarf fall a bit, revealing that her mouth seems to have turned into a monstrous jagged maw of knife-like teeth* "Fair point, but I'm a sucker for damsels in distress.""I'm not so sure about that. We all have our emotional weakpoints, they just vary from person to person."[end?]"That guy?" "Well, let's just hope for the best."*She seems to grow larger as she growls, beginning to tower over him*"Didn't realize that was a archetype.""Well, at least it doesn't sound like too bad of a one too be. Could be worse, like "hits on drunk girls" guy or "cries himself to sleep" guy."*She is still growling*"Thankfully you have no proof that I fit either of those criteria."*She zips out of the way, ending up behind him in a flash. She's at least a head taller than him by now, and she suddenly tackled him from behind*"Not right now though. For now you need to rest up.""Is that a threat or a promise?""Well, I'll count it as a little of both. Threatened, complimented, and hit on by a goddess in one night, pretty interesting watercooler story."*He smiles under his mask* "Alright, you should get some rest. I'll make sure nobody tries anything while you're out cold."*She tries to hold his arms down*"Trust me, it's tempting." *he says with a sigh**He looks over her, then groans and mumbles to himself* "I am getting way too chivalrous for this... Thor, I am amazingly flattered and *very much* would like to take up the offer, but you're in no state to be making choices like that right now.""Stop it. Now." *there's no playfullness in her voice this time**He sighs* "I'm really sorry, and hope you'll thank me for this when you're sober.""Alright, want me to get you a blanket?""One sec." *He goes to look for a blanket, coming back with one off of one of the beds*"Alright, sleep tight and try not to call a thunderstorm on us or anything. I'll take guard duty."[want to skip to when she wakes up?]"I know. But sometimes someone needs to figure themselves out, it's alright to be there for her but she needs to be able to stand on her own eventually.""Is that all?""Yay..." *She seems content to sit and rest for a while, happy that things aren't terrible for once*"I get it.""And she didn't tell you anything else about it?"*Skoll is sitting in front of the couch, sipping a beer and flipping through channels on the TV*"Ya, she needs help. Unless there was a double-entendre in there that I missed.""What if I *knew* why she did it?""Which half? The help or the entendres?""The saaaame reason she lied to me."*Ya, he's keeping himself entertained while on guard duty. He also has his back to her and against the front of the couch*"Got it. Just... Remember what's happened.""So, woke up already sleeping beauty?""And the reason everything went wrong." *She seems fairly engry about this topic*"Alright. Remember, even if she's hotter than the sun in the middle of July, with how Thor is right now it might be a smarter idea to just say no until she gets more stable, even if you end up single before that.""Gonna take a wild guess and say you're still drunk off your ass?""I would show you the letter about it but I kind of burnt it."[oh! sorry for the confusion!]

"Alright, just making sure.""Alright, feel like you need to puke? I promised Alice I wouldn't do it on the furniture but if you do I'll take the blame.""Oh ya! Her sister put a curse on her that made it so she can't have a good relationship so she had to dump me on one of the most important days of her life and take some other bitch to the ceremony thingy instead and then get mad at me for being upset and say it was a mistake to start dating me in the first place and tell me to go kill her sister on Niflheimr so she can go date someone else!" *The entire time she says this she is smiling, but obviously upset from her shaking*"Good because I think she can and would kick my ass.""Think begging would help?""Alright, I'll write my will then.""You can have it now if you like." "You want the authentic bloodstains?"*He chuckles* "Didn't figure you'd be a hematolagniac" "Like what?""I'm not that shy, but if you are then feel free." *He says teasingly*"Then by all means, whisper. Mind if I join you on the couch by the way? This carpet is great but I lost feeling in my ass five minutes ago""I know, but this isn't the kind of thing I like taking any chances on."*He stands up, stretches, and takes the seat next to her**He nods along, looking a bit impressed under his mask* "Well, the Asgardians really do know how to party.""Kinky girl. If you sober up and decide white leather biker guys aren't your thing you mind giving me her number?""Really?""And leave such a great conversation partner?" "I take it you're talking from experience?""Noted. Still, you sure you want to just send me off? I'm fine just chilling out here for a while. I can talk to her any time- probably. What's her name anyway?""Thanks for the heads up. For the time being I'll admit I'm waiting to see what you think when you're not drunk though.""Ah. She told me she was dating a girl named Freya, that could get... Messy. Or not, depending on you guys's personalities, some groups can pull that off.""I get it. You're in a fucked-up situation in general, sexual tension isn't making it any easier.""Yep. This kind of reminds me of a story a friend of mine told me.""I forget some of the details, but he started getting a crush on a friend of his, she was cute and they where good friends. He started wondering if he really wanted to date her, but when he finally worked up the courage to ask her he realized something on their date.""That's really as far as it went between them. They liked being around each other and he thought she was cute, but they didn't really like each other any more than normal friends. Just goes to show sometimes friends with sexual tension are just that, and given the kind of situation you came out of you might want to be careful about relationships in general."*He shrugs* "Alright, just a piece of advice from a creepy guy in a helmet.""Still though even if you like her for real, it's common courtesy to not mess with a relationship that's already going. Unless she and Freya are cool with it of course."*He shrugs* "She needs help, I'm a hero. Bullets and cackling fashion designers aren't the only things I try to save people from.""If it gets to be too much you can just stay in your room for a bit and put on some nice loud music. Your room's got a lock, right?""You sure?""Alright, feel free to call me whenever you feel like it, preferably if you're sober and don't think I'm a creep still." *He stands, stretching* "It was nice talking to you again, Thor."*He wanders into the party a bit, looking for Vallir while also trying to keep an eye on Thor*"Ya, there was a fashion designer terrorist one time. Had to cut off his hand with a boomerang when he tried to press a detonator that would blow up the building and all the models, then I walked on stage in a suit and said to the model "looks like you could use a hand". That was pretty corny in retrospect."*RPing him meeting Vallir or no?**Alright! Where does he see her in the party? Also, we don't have to if you don't want to**He saunters nearby, sipping his drink through a straw as usual, and comments* "Asgard gets superheroes, magic, *and* girls like you? Not fair.""What? I make bad puns sometimes.""Skoll, no relation to the myth- probably. I'm guessing you're Vallir, but I wouldn't mind meeting your friends either.""Well, nice to hear that. Most people groan at that one.""What can I say, I'm a friendly guy.""Chatted with Thor for a while, interesting topics came up, she suggested I go talk to you while she sobers up and thinks about life.""Really? It's that easy to pique your interest?" *He says a bit teasingly*"You might be pleasantly surprised. The stupid outfit, name, and helmet aren't just a halloween gag, after all.""[okay...]" *She says, switching back to speaking Japanese*"The helmet doesn't, but the rest might depending on how tonight goes."*He shrugs and says* "I'm giving the odds a 50/50.""Yep. So, what do you like? I don't really know much about you except your name and Thor's 'experiences' with you.""I'm glad you like it, I'm free for standup on Tuesdays and Saturdays." *He says jokingly*"Nice to hear. Now, let's get wasted and forget our problems."[end here, or want to skip to some later point in time?][okay! Skoll talked to Thor for a while then she kind of set him up with her old girlfriend. Not Hati, like her first girlfriend ever.][your welcome!]"Gack! Why is nothing ever good here?" *She tries rubbing her hands together to neutralize it somewhat* [twi I just realized we have to rewind. I forgot she only has one hand]*She makes her way towards him, tossing things haphazardly as she goes. She stumbles a bit, but it doesn't seem to bother her much**She looks at them, and does eeny-meeny-miny-moe. She ends up with the blue one, she still stores the red one in her shorts in case she decides she likes red more later**Yes**She tries rubbing it on herself to warm her hand up**She does so, breathing on her hand to try to warm it up*"Blech.""Ever thought of putting glass on the ceiling, making it a greenhouse kind of?"*Lilith is gorging herself as usual, she seems to prefer the mashed potatoes and cranberries* "Would that work or am I being an idiot?"*I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE**She is smiling a bit less and shaking a bit more*"Sweet. Plus it would probably be great for tanning.""Cozy!" *She begins to look around, being wise enough to try not walking under the chandelier directly*"Fashion designer? Cool, I just saved a fashion show on earth from some crazy guy a week or two back."*She is getting annoyed with all this running, but the terrifying part is that she doesn't seem tired in the slightest. As she nears the body, her foot comes down right on top of, and subsequently right through its chest with a sickening crunch and squish*"I'm fine!"*She most certainly does not look or sound fine*"Ya, he was planning on blowing the place and all the models sky high if they didn't give him some prize. Also all the money in the building of course.""Ab-so-lutely!""So?!""Why not?""Think I need it?"*She pouts at him, but her scarf covers it*"Nah, I just like helping people.""Maybe..."*Her veneer of stability kind of collapses as she hugs back and cries a fair bit*"Thank god someone thinks so, I was almost to the point of putting a wig on a pink motorcycle helmet." *He says jokingly* *He does as well, under his helmet.*"Sure."*He takes it with a bit of flourish* "Where to?""That's a bit of a complicated situation. How about yours?""That works.""If you say so."*She seems intent on crying and incoherently babbling for a bit*"[insert hotel name here!]"[want to just fade/skip to next morning?][well, I kind of figured that was where it was going with the hotel and everything, but if they are just going to talk I would like to do that]"You'd look even better."*She eventually seems to calm down slightly*[oh... I don't think I know it then..?][okaaaay. Sorry for the misunderstanding!]*Skoll is, inexplicably, brushing his teeth in the bathroom after a shower. He's somehow still wearing the helmet*"Mhm." *It seems to have changed style a bit, allowing him to slide the visor up enough to brush his teeth.*"No way. That's a style in Japan, you know. Girls with light hair and tan skin."*He finishes brushing and fairly jokingly says says* "Thanks, it takes some getting used to but at least I don't need to worry about random slips trips and falls."*She shrugs* "It depends. Some of them can't pull it off but I think you could if you wanted to.""Hopefully the owner won't mind replacing the headboard. And the boxspring. And the bed frame in general.""I'll chip in too, I'd feel like an asshole otherwise.""Oh come on, don't be like that. Don't I look good with dark skin and bright hair?""Oh come on, don't make me beg." *He says teasingly*"Ya, you see what I mean? You can totally pull it off then.""Ack! I am not for the shooting!" *She begins fleeing around frantically while looking for where the bolt came from*"Is that a promise?"*She frowns a bit at the nevermind* "Were you going to say something else just then?"[skip again?]*She looks at her, seeming obviously unbelieving of the answer*[like what?]"I kind of feel like you're changing the subject.""A fair bit less horrible than everyone else. And rejected by who?""So what? He was probably an asshole anyway if he rejected you." "Nah, you are. Even I can tell that and I'm totally inept at this kind of thing.""Why not?""Why?""That's a poor reason."*Now might be a good time to say something*"What makes you think anyone else has a happier life?"[alright. I was kind of hoping some time in the morning they could get to know each other better, but we can have that happen after their... romp.]"Then change your situation, not who you are.""Not really."[okay! skipping to a fair bit of time later]

*Skoll is now lying on the mostly trashed bed, somehow smoking a cigarette with his helmet still on*"Yes it is.""I recall some begging on both sides.""I'd rather thank you than blame you.""What's a word better than great? Because I think great's not good enough for you. Asgard must be awesome.""Hey! Go away robot man! I am not for shooting!" *She waves her fist angerly at him as she tries, unsuccessfully, to find a place to hide*"What's it like?" "Oh! Magic, good!" *She swings again, this time actually aiming instead of kind of flailing*"Do all the girls look like you?""Is it?""I don't know what to do...""I can buy that. So does that mean no hot sisters?""Why did you swing at me?""Why?"*He grins under his helmet*"Who, me? Please, I would never." *He says half-jokingly* "And?""Thank you~""But I don't want to do nothing!""And so you tried to hurt me?""So, wanna get some breakfast?""Sweet." *He gets out of bed, his clothes appearing back on his body. He's out of his halloween costume and wearing his usual white jacket now*"So, when people hurt you you're supposed to hurt them?" *She is quiet for a bit**She suddenly pops off of him, standing up straight and smiling with her wicked jagged teeth*may I do Tuesday and Thursday meals and the pvp? "Same to you, like the outfit." *He jokes*"Thank you sparky! Things make a lot more sense now!""Alright, any preference?" thank you!"So... Do something..?""Things! When somebody hurts you, you hurt them! It's simple!""Baked goods, fruits, sweets, bacon, sausage- you can probably cross that last one off the checklist in your case you've probably had enough for now.""Alright, if you're good then later." *He says teasingly*"We're going to run out of beds eventually.""But why not?""That'll come in handy if I ever visit. Which reminds me, think you'd like to do this again and if so with or without a date beforehand? I'm really fine whichever way you pick.""Alright, we can talk about it after breakfast. I'm pretty sure this place has a restaurant on the first floor.""This way then." *He puts an arm around her waist and leads the way to the restaurant.*"That doesn't make sense!""So?"*He gets them a table, though the waiter seems a bit offput by Skoll's strange appearance*"I want to hurt somebody who hurt me! Hurting bad people is okay!""That depends on how a lot of things go.""Mostly relationship things.""Why is that important?""That's good to hear, I was a bit worried you just wanted me for my helmet and my anatomy that shares its name with a breakfast food.""Why should it matter to you if Thor hurt me?""A big one too."*She seems a bit confused by him suddenly leaving* "Hey! Tell me!"*He seems proud under his mask*"So, what're you thinking of for breakfast? I'm going to get a smoothie." "Real? Why wouldn't I be real?" *She sounds offended*"Waffles. Tasty and memetic." "Good choice."*She looks offended by the accusation* "I am Hati!"*When the waiter arrives he orders their meals* "From what I hear, ya.""That's a bit of a complicated story. Probably goes further back than me to be honest."*She pouts at him*"Yep. Like I said, not relation to the myth *probably*.""I don't really know enough about Asgardian history to say.""Mind doing a study date some time?" *He says jokingly* "Sounds like it'll still work fine for me.""Sparky! Why are you so grumpy?""What though!""Tell me them!""Why not?"*She pouts, but with her current mouth it looks a bit terrifying*"What? Also why?"*Their meals arrive, he uses a straw to sip his smoothie* "Try putting syrup on it. And butter."*She pouts a bit under her scarf**Trish is a freelance back-alley doctor, doing medical work for people who don't want to be found.*

*Hati is barely classifiable as medical personnel, more like equipment. She searches the cities for the wounded and the sick and delivers them to doctors.*

*Skoll is a surgeon, using his powers to summon surgical equipment seemingly out of thin air. Nobody knows why he wears a helmet.*

*Carnelia is probably worse, and likely steals then sells medical supplies. She is bad.**He continues drinking, waiting for her reaction*"Then tell me!""Ack!" *She runs to the edge while trying to fire a small roof to cover her*"I'm no good at planning.""Yes!"*He chuckles**Okay! doing what..?*"I didn't realize earth food would be so impressive compared to asgardian food.""Why?"*Oh... He probably wouldn't be very conversational*"Sounds great."*Okay!*"Most humans do.""Both!"*Alright! Skoll is standing outside of the operating room, his outfit a pristine white again despite having had blood splatters on it not five minutes ago. He looks relieved, even with his mask that's obvious* "I am...?""Is it spit roasted?" "Damn, I was about to make a fantastic pun.""Am I... Your only friend...?""Hm? Nah, that's just our job. You feeling alright?""Am I...?""Well, I wouldn't have guessed that you're a fan of spit roasts.""Ha! I didn't realize you liked me *that* much.""You can do the job and you do it well, that's enough in my eyes.""But I am not your only one?""It's good to know though. I'll get back to you on that when I figure out cloning.""Sure, if you've got an appetite right now.""Oh, that's okay...""Well, someone's sounding a bit greedy.""Thanks. I'm really liking you so far too." *He sounds more sincere than usual*"Alright, some people don't after surgery.""Sure!""Yessir!""Ha! Let's just go get fast food or something.""What?""Sure thing.""Yay!" *She does so**He just waits, apparently already clean**She hugs tightly, but not enough to hurt*"Ack!" *She tries doing so, and in a panic fires more ice at the wave of shards**His clothes suddenly turn into a normal white jacket and pants*"No problem Sparky!""What do you think?""Oh, that's nice." *She comments to herself before firing another blast at the metal man*"So... What were you talking about planning?"*He grins under his mask*"How?""Well, we could just get fast food.""Well, I think you can do it! I don't support it, but I think you can do it!""Well, got any better ideas?""IHOP?" *The moment is a bit ruined by him slurping the smoothie*"Why's that?""Why?""Hm?"*She pouts at that answer*"Well, that's too bad."*He finishes the remains of his smoothie fairly quickly* "Mind if I have some?""Close enough, Red Hood from batman. Just not red.""Megaman zero, unless I'm too drunk to remember my retro characters. Which would be weird since I've had like, two beers.""But I don't think it's True."*He begins snacking on the waffles*"Wait until you try muffins.""Character's still retro. ish."*He laughs a bit*"Don't worry, you'd still look pretty cute. And we can probably order one here.""Nice sword. Also at this point basically anything pre-2008 is being called 'retro', it's a little weird.""I meant what I said and I said what I meant.""Because then I would have gotten hurt and lied to and betrayed and then just left! Those things still happened!"*He laughs* "Try not to make yourself sick.""Never said it made sense, people are weird.""Sure. You want me to describe what some of these things are or you just want to go in blind?" *He says as he opens the menu*"As you wish." *He says, grinning under his mask as he orders a laundry list of different foods.**He tells her what each one is and occasionally picks bits off. He actually looks pretty impressed.**He laughs* "You joke, but some people are really like that.""You're pretty determined about this.""The allure of the baked goods is stronger?""Most of them are online."*She growls a bit in annoyance*"So. Wanna see something cool?""So. Wanna see something cool?""Well, as long as you aren't getting to the point where I need to wheel you around" *He says teasingly*"I'll be here as the voice of lax and occasional reason then.""Can the hero have a kiss?" *He asks semi-jokingy*"Watch closely." *He holds his hands about a foot apart, and a bright shifting light appears and begins to shape itself between them*"And when did I say I wanted Thor back?""Is this close enough?" *He says, his helmet shifting to a model that leaves most of his face below the bridge of his nose uncovered* "Tease.""It's a complicated issue. Want to go back to eating your pancakes and discuss it later?""Ah-ah-ah, one sec-" *The shape begins to solidify, and then he reaches a hand in an pulls out a glowing freshly-forged imitation of the z-saber*"Good." *His helmet goes back to normal as he stabs a piece of pancake with his fork and holds it up to her mouth*"I just... I don't know! I wanna do something right now!""Thank you, thank you, I also do standup and card tricks." *He says jokingly*"You sure you'll be able to finish all this?""Ya but other things! Big things!""That might work for now...""Sorry, they don't last very long once I put them down." *To demonstrate, he holds the handle out towards her so she can take it*"Wow, Asgardian feasts must be impressive."*It is remarkably well balanced, and beautifully crafted. It would likely work as an actual sword. After a few seconds, however, it suddenly 'poofs' out of existence in a puff of twinkling lights* "If so... How many chubby people are there in Asgard? Or do you all do workouts and stuff to deal with it?""Huh. Didn't really expect that.""Yep. I'm working on making them last longer.""Eep!" *She is a bit surprised by the portal but, with some trepidation, walks through it*"No deal, sorry.""Well, the choice is up to you!"*She pats him on the head*"Ya, but the mask doesn't come off.""Hm?""Alright. So, to the IHOP?"*She decides to follow him in the party for the time being*"Uh...?""I've got a motorcycle.""Oh! Sparky?" *She picks him up and shakes him a bit**She shrugs and decides to carry him to a hospital**He makes his way to the parking lot and to a beautifully designed and fancy-looking white and silver motorcycle*"Yep. Friend of mine made it for me."[you spelled it wrong.]

*The dog lounges but takes the mallet right to the face, going off course and slamming into one of the purrifiers coming back from the beach. Meanwhile, in the bushes, Lilith finally manages to get a good grip on the dog and crush some of the vital parts of its skull. One of the last people in the cars comes out, it appears to be one of the Chile soldiers, laser gun and all.*

/u/Trevosutto 

[as a serious note, we need to think of what to do. this is *the last day* to get this done and we don't even have the whole team in the base.]*She doesn't notice, heat doesn't really effect her* *He does so* "You have a helmet, or do you wanna use my spare?""Hello Sparky!""No worries." *He holds his hands together and a helmet seemingly appears.* "Here you go. Just don't go too far, if you do it'll disappear.""Okay, I'll be quiet!""I'll drive slow so you can stay on more easily."*She happily rushes to the hospital*"I know. You ever think of getting a prosthetic?""Yep!""I just think it might come in handy once in a while. No pun intended."*She shrugs*"Well, it's your choice.""Got it." *He starts the engine and begins driving slowly and carefully to IHOP*"Hm?""No it's not?"*He doesn't mind*"Just be careful not to fall off."*She doesn't let go, and shakes him a bit* "Bad Sparky!""Sparky don't make me bite you!" *She says with a pout while passing him off to the people with the stretcher**They arrive at the IHOP fairly quickly*"Yay! He calmed down!"*He laughs a bit* "First time riding a motorcycle?"*She waits patiently in the waiting room, eventually taking a nap*"Well, you can ride it again after lunch. or dinner. I don't keep track sometimes.""Ya, can't wait to get a long night's rest.""Ack! Emergency evasive maneuvers!" *She begins fleeing around wildly and firing blasts randomly as she panics* "Oh! What's up with Sparky?""So, getting anything special or just pancakes?""Oh! Why'd he do that?""Ditto, I'm not in the mood for anything complicated."IC: *Lilith writes PEOPLE WHO FIGHT FROM FAR FAR AWAY*

OOC: uuuuum... In that case probably French because I speak some French or Germany because I am proud of my heritage! *Lilith seems intent on eating her whole day's worth of food in smoothies alone, but keeps getting brain freezes* [I really don't think that will help. Given our current speed, there's no way we'll get done fast enough.]*They get a seat and he orders pancakes*"Is he awake?"*She looks confused at all the storm troopers*"Which one of you?""Ha! That is the power of the esteemed Cambel family!""This one? Just a few months.""Yay! Can I see him?""Ya, I guess my expectations where effected by myths and such. Which is weird since I know the myths aren't right."*She waves back, then clutches her head again as she gets another smoothie.*"Oh! That's useful!" *She goes forth, deciding to take off the cold glove. Her victory was making her feel more adventurous, red is better for an adventure.*"Got it, kind of expected as much but I'll try to not bring them up then.""Cool. Sorry about that.""Yes ma'am!" *She skips down the hall to his room*"Didn't. I'm just starting.""Hello!""What can I say, I'm good at making friends.""How are you feeling, Sparky?""Well, it's nice to know that.""Something wrong?""Oh! A nurse can go get you some water then.""What do you mean?"*He shrugs* "We can just talk about normal stuff. What do you like to do? Outside of work I mean.""Hey! Off! Bad glove!" *She tries to pull it off with her teeth as she keep going forth*"Why are there so many clone troopers?""If you're good with your spare time.""Ya, because you wouldn't calm down when I told you too! I just wanted to bite you to calm you down but they used medicine instead.""Think a croissant would help make up for it?" *He asks, holding one up to her*"Any particular reason why?""Yep!" *She suddenly grows wolf ears instead of normal ones*"Like stage magic or real magic?""Alright, just don't touch anything in it." *He takes out a white flip phone*"I think I know which one it'll be from that answer.""Probably not?""I like old tech, tech used to have style. Also, neat trick."*He heard it quite well* "No worries, it wasn't that bad.""Why would you hurt me?"*She eventually pouts at it* "Fine, if you will not cooperate, I will still not be deprived of my red." *She attempts to slip the other glove on over the first one*"Sure.""So?""But *why* would you hurt me? I am a good Hati!"*Soon enough their food arrives*"It's a funny hammer!""Hey, my mic works just fine." *He says, holding the phone up closer to make it easier to hear him**He sighs* "And this is what I get for trying to be nice." *He suddenly flips the phone closed**He chuckles a bit and opens it up again* "So, would you mind putting my stuff back? Sorry for the sudden blackout.""Why are you all in the same costume?""Nice.""Oh! Why are you in that costume too then?""Mostly. How long do you intend to stay in there?""Sweet trick, and fitting costume.""But didn't you just say they suck for having that costume?""I feel like this was the better choice.""Skoll, yours?"*She looks confused now*"Nice to meet you. Alex." *Her offers her a handshake*"So, you liking the party?""Don't worry, drunk people are weird but give them their space and they're pretty harmless. Some of them can be funny too."*She pouts a bit*"Oh! Purple, perfect for a regal lady like myself!"*Still pouting*"Sure."[I'm not sure, ask for more time maybe..?]"I still don't get it.""Oooooh! But doesn't this kind of make it better?"*She began searching for the nearest person to fight, since her current opponent seems to have run off*

/u/Zorrekky and /u/Acciosun you may want to show up now. Lilith is blinded but Ditto ran off, she accidentally killed one of his duplicates while blinded."But aren't the clones supposed to be in an army?""Well, that's good to hear. I was about to have to resort to Italian wedding cookies.""So it's good that there's an army of you here!""You should lead the army!""Why?""Why?"*Even in her currently blinded state, Lilith manages to navigate the forest moderately well in an attempt to find Katja by following her voice*

/u/Zorrekky "And?"[don't forget to tag!]*He grins and holds one of the small cookies up to her*[if you have not had those before, they are wonderful.]

"Like it?""Why?"*Lilith makes her way to Katja, she's covered in a large amount of blood but no cuts. She seems to be stumbling around a bit, like she can't see where she's going.*

/u/Zorrekky[what order will we all go in now?]

/u/Acciosun
/u/Zorrekky [well, there's not really any way parts of that will work or that we'll finish this in time, but I guess I'll just go along with it so we can get as much done as we can...] 

*While he can't really pull Lilith in any way whatsoever, she does start to come along on her own. She also swings a punch at the Chile soldier as she is taking aim, knocking her out. The other one begins to work her radio, it might be a good idea to stop that.*

/u/Trevosutto"Great, because there's more." [want to skip to when she's done?]"I have a hammer?""Hm?"[okay!]

"Wow, that was downright impressive."*He claps his hands*"You eat like that often?"*She pouts a bit at this answer**She seems confused now*"Oh! Skoll!""I don't get it!""Just remember to take it easy once in a while."*More pouting*"So, where to now? Unless you need to get back to Asgard.""Alright, any idea when we can see each other again? I kind of doubt they've got Skype in Asgard. Though if they do that's fucking amazing.""Does it work with earth skype?"*This pouting probably isn't possible by normal humans at this point**Not stopping* "Stop it!""Being so mean to yourself!""Then stop! You're my friend and I hit people who are mean to my friends!"*Lilith seems intent on finishing off the few remaining soldiers here, motioning for him to go ahead. She then, in a move likely surprising to most of the people who know her, picks up two of the rifles from dead purifiers, opening fire. It seems to have surprised them too, because the Chile soldier and the one coming back from the beach both get gunned down. The other dog is getting back up from its earlier tumble, and she prepares to fight it. Psycho should probably go in, she can handle this.*

/u/Trevosutto [you know we're not here for prisoners, right..? He's just supposed to plug the USB into the main computer.]*She raises her hand threateningly while pouting*[order will be Lilith, Katja, Ditto, Ichor then?]

*Lilith has no means to communicate, which seems to be distressing her. She suddenly stops her general distress and begins looking around though, apparently sniffing the air. The blood on her made this difficult, but she could definitely smell a hint of someone nearby.*

Not that I don't like your company, in fact it's pretty awesome, but we might not always have the time for a rendezvous. Or the spare beds.""Alright, good to know. I try not to be a pest unless someone asks me to.""Oh? Who to?" *He asks with a grin**Lilith makes her way through the halls, making more noise than is probably a good idea but also taking out several soldiers with powerful strikes as they round corners. She takes their weapons with her as she goes, and by the time she bursts into the main computer room about a minute later she has a nice collection of at least five rifles and one of the laser rifles. She nods a greeting to the other two. Meanwhile, near the entrance, the trashed patrol has been found, and Purifiers are starting to search the base. Lilith puts down two of her guns to write on a piece of paper WHAT NOW?*

/u/Trevosutto"Now now, not in public~" *He teases*"Ya, but you told me to be a pest." *He grins under his mask*"Is that a threat or a promise?""Now, don't be mean to yourself or I'll hit you!""Now who's being a pest?""Fair point, but one that might need punishing later.""I thought you said you needed to get back. Although, if you don't, we don't need to be out of the room until noon.""We could test the limits of that statement.""Yay! How about this idea, any time you want to be mean to yourself just be mean to me instead!""I'll lead the way." *He smiles and leaves a fairly large amount of cash on the table to pay for the meal, then begins to walk back to their room*[want to skip to afterwords, or perhaps when she goes back to Asgard?][sorry...][okaaay...]

Of course from here we need to kind of think of what Hati and Skoll are. Speaking of, what's the common knowledge in Asgard about those two?][oh. alright, I will try to think some thingies up then][well, unless he wakes up again soon Hati would have probably wandered off][the first battle event will be up in a day or two, he doesn't have the names and such yet]"So, desert?""I'll get a milkshake, you?"*Lilith writes AREN'T THERE WAY MORE OF THEM THEN THERE ARE OF US?*

*Dolly's mindscape is actually a pretty standard teenage girl's room, just expanded into millions of them. However, all the doors are impossible for her to open due to her wings.*

*Carnelia's mindscape is literally the comfiest thing imaginable, but things often come in and ruins the comfort totally, such as random water splashes.*"Ewwww. Why am I learning pokemon moves?"*What color is it?*yay! now to work on Brokkr who is most definitely not sensitive about his height or his skin tone or how pointy his ears are or being unable to grow a beard or anything!"Purple and green..." *She thinks for a bit, considering the color* "Meh, I have seen worse.""Hey, what is it doing now?"[tag please]"Ech! I never asked to be a *purple* dragon!"*She is also sickened by her poor fashion. She walks forward while pouting*[it's okay, i will try to remind you when you do!]"No worries."IC: *Lilith writes A BUNNY RABBIT*

OOC: i am not really sure! sorry!*Lilith looks rather annoyed. She looks generally in Katja's direction, then points to herself and covers her eyes. It seems she is trying to tell Katja of her current disability*

so, have you decided yet? will she keep the rifle or no? I need to get started on making the fights soon
*Lilith is gorging on Burgers. She is happy.*okaaaaay! keep in mind the stats and such!*She shakes her head and writes THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DUMB PLAN I JUST WANT TO GET THE USB THINGY AND GET BACK HOME*

/u/Trevosutto*Lilith, meanwhile, has dragged the nearest knocked out bodies inside and closed the doors. She is keeping lookout. Suddenly, one of the guards' radios begins crackling, and speech comes from it* "*Lieutenant, where are you? we have intruders in the base!*" *Lilith has no idea what to do, someone else should probably handle that.*

/u/Trevosutto okay! i was more wondering about it since he can make tasers and the like. is it approved other than that bit then?[didn't they do that in a skip though..? or is that noncanon/she's lying to Johnny?][no, not really. battles will probably happen on the weekend due to some minor complications. you have plenty of time to write!] [okay!][okay! will he be helping in matches at all?][alright, just checking!][spooky]yay! thank you!
[ooooh okay. also, Brokkr event is up!]*He does, but doesn't seem interested in 'the plebian works of the monkeys' as he would say*[and, for the record, the pun needs you to pronounce 'au' like 'aw']"Not all keys? But I don't have *any* keys! Damn riddles..." *She walks over and looks down the ladder**He walks past Sasha, not caring much.**As He walks down the sidewalk he looks at the hoverboard with mild interest*"Hm?" *He looks over at her, small screens inside his visor showing pieces of information for a few moments* "Wonderful, it's Thor." *He says slightly sarcastically*[link to his page please?]

"That's all a mater of opinions. Also of getting actually *good* magic."[last time i saw he was, he got a serious fever.]"What a gaudy piece of junk." *He comments as he walks*[he's only 6'1", tall but not gigantic]

"Uh... May I help you, insect?""I am bright because of my armor, though I see no way you could mistake me for a *flower*""Yes, shiny things do that." *He says in a mildly annoyed tone*"What exactly are you? I don't have records referring to overgrown humanoid insects on earth.""Not according to my knowledge. Bees look more like this." *He holds one of his massive gauntlets palm-up and a small drop of metal floats off from it, forming into a colored statue of a bumblebee a few inches above his hand**He narrows his eyes a bit as the metal is reabsorbed and his gauntlet solidifies again* "I will need to investigate this further.""Eugh. Puns. Also, eggs? There are more of you?""Hm?" *He looks over a bit disinterestedly**Hati knocks on the window, smiling*"No, I called human magic disappointing, please pay attention.""Hiiiiiiiii" *Her scarf slips in and undoes the lock from inside, slipping the window open for her*"Worse in what way?" *He doesn't seem to be paying much attention, he's looking more at some moving shapes on his visor. Wait... Is he playing pong? Ya, that looks like pong.**She crawls in, sitting at the foot of his bed* "You feelin better?"*He rolls his eyes* "Why do you all have to be so violent?""Maaaaybe. Do you still have that ring thingy?""Wow, impressive." *He says sarcastically*"Odd. Why are you not there?"*The suit seems to shift a bit, seeming more... watery. The oversized gauntlets suddenly extend and shift, turning into two large swords which he swings at the water creatures* "Really? Do you normally attack people in the street?""Could I borrow it?""Strange system. I will investigate it further at some point."*She pouts* "Why not?""Hm. Insteresting spell, and rather familiar. Had you made these on Nidavellir I would consider suing for patent infringement." *The swords reform into spinning blades which he rather casually holds to the water beings*"But you said the rings were for me!""Firstly, I have no reason to kill giant bees, and secondly don't threaten me."*He lifts one of his arms in the way, some of the mass redistributing into a shield-like shape.* "Don't you monkeys have laws or something against random assault?""No! I want it!" *She is pouting more heavily now*"Flaming ogre? Do you even look at who you talk to or do you just close your eyes and make assumptions?" *Some of the mass of his suit rises up over his face, sealing around the visor and making a solid helmet*"You said they were mine now you won't let me have it, you lied to me too!" *She seems pretty upset*"What, insecure about your height?" *He says with a cocky grin as the shield arm goes back to normal*"Personal business, mostly to see what these monkeys claim to be 'technology' and laugh at the attempts."*She turns her back to him, crossing her arms and pouting**He rolls his eyes* "Is that really grounds for attacking me? Look if you're that insecure you should speak to a psychiatrist of some kind.""That's what I asked!" *She says, fairly angerly*"No, I insulted human magic. I will admit many of you do rather well with what you have, *almost* as good as some dwarven magic, but you simply cannot make a- "mona lisa", I believe would be the appropriate allusion- with fingerpaints.""Why would you think I would do that?""I was referring to the humans.""Oh, what a wonderous comeback, I am so terribly scarred by it that I shan't be able to continue another day." *He says with thick sarcasm. Also, it looks like he's still playing pong**She pouts**His feet expand, sucking in air to become flotation devices*"Close enough to them.""I am a good Hati!" *She reaches over to grab it, smiling now**He narrows his eyes, looking bemused* "I do not have time to explain evolution."*He is silent for a second, under his helmet his face contorts with rage* "Did you just call me an elf?""I promise I will not try to hurt people!""Yay!" *She takes the ring happily**He grits his teeth and practically growls* "Damned monkeys, having no idea what thy're talking about.""Not extremely so.""No, I also wanted to make sure you are not dead! I am glad to find out you aren't!""No, I just don't want to explain it.""I will not blame you for your own ignorance, but if you would bother to pay attention-" *His helmet slides off and he points to his face* "I am *obviously* a Dwarf!""What?""Why is sharpie on your face?""What does that have to do with anything?"*She does so, it's his acceptance letter isn't it?*"A baby?! I am Brokkr, greatest smith of the Dwarves!""Adorable?" *He walks over, actually growing taller as he walks closer.**She pouts at it for a bit, then smiles* "You can do it, Sparky!""Yay!""You have an exceedingly odd and disturbing definition of cute.""It is, but you can look it up on your own. I am not a science teacher.""Nah, you can do it on your own! I believe in you!""Do I look like a library to you?""I am still not a history teacher, I am a smith.""Don't worry Sparky! You don't need help!""What, I do not rampage!"*He rolls his eyes* "Would it help if I gave you an abridged version?""Try a library.""A building with a large number of books.""Some do.""Listen better next time, I do not like repeating myself.""Ask a librarian.""Hm?" *He looks over, his visor searching the internet for any relevant information regarding this person**Lilith is currently still in the kitchen, baking another cake while listening to some childish song on the radio and dancing a bit to it*"Close enough.""Nidavellir, home of the Dwarves and Svartalfheimr, home of the Dark elves, are twin worlds. We are two completely different beings who have been at odds for quite a while due to the Dark Elves' incredible laziness. To compensate for both our planets' poor magnetic fields, Dwarves did the sensible thing and lived underground while Dark Elves decided to blot out their skies."*She pouts*"Do I look like a map to you?""Well, who knew, the monkeys *do* have civilized craftsmen.""A thing that tells you where to go." *He says, slightly annoyed**He looks rather annoyed* "I will just find you some directions there." *His visor begins to flash various images*"Firstly, it's not biased if it is True. Secondly, with *stolen* Dwarven technology.""Yay!" *She smiles and hugs him**It ends on a map, which would be backwards from her perspective.* "Down this street, left on 4th avenue, then two blocks further. Now why are you staring at me?""I thought you where asking how they managed it, not what I meant by it.""For now!""They obviously didn't turn out the sun. We were on twin planets, if they had then the Dwarves would be able to live on the surface too. They used stolen dwarven technology to cover their planet in a field of radioactively powered microsatelites, a "black cloud" of sorts.""The one with a sign that says 4th avenue.""Want me to deal with those sharpie thingies by the way?""That is not what I meant!" *He sounds annoyed**He groans in annoyance* "Follow me." *He begins walking**He seems highly offended, but does return a bow* "Brokkr, and I am a dwarf. I would recommend catching up with your knowledge of my kind, it is a *great* offense to insinuate what you have."*He reaches the sign for 4th ave and points to it* "Read this.""You are even incapable of reading? How are you alive?""My my, how mature.""Well, sorry if I am hurting your feelings but I have been feeling rather poorly lately. Why is this planet so uncultured?""I am surprised you have not tried to eat insecticide yet.""Someone called me a 'dick' earlier for not liking a skeleton welded together from scrap metal."*He is silent for a bit, then very sarcastically says* "Nooooo. It probably tastes like candy too."*She steps over and tries to lick some of the sharpie off of him*"Maybe?""I didn't, someone made it for another purpose most likely.""As I could tell.""At a hardware store.""I will not apologize for honesty.""Blech. It tastes bad.""Go work for it, or just ask and someone might give you some.""I've been here all day.""We will never know since the Dark Elves killed the original creator and took it.""You do homework?""It has been a less than pleasant experience. Someone attacked me in the street because I didn't like their magic enough and then proceeded to call me an elf.""Why?""The difference is that Svartalvs and Dwarves look *nothing alike*""It's junk metal made to look like it's a fantastic work.""You're not the problem, the sharpie tastes bad!""Indeed."*His eyes narrow a bit* "I am unsure if I really wish to have your help.""What? It's a plain fact.""That would take far more effort than I would bother to use.""Oh yes, steal en entire artificial metal atmosphere, why didn't I think of that?" *He says sarcastically*"Yes just taste kind of bland. A bit salty from your sweat but other than that bland.""Why not live in a human home?""Sure." *He says sarcastically*"It's not racist if the statement is accurate.""Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you are an expert in archaic Nivadellirian technology. Obviously you're more qualified in this than the planet's greatest craftsman." *His sarcasm is thick enough to cut with a knife*"Well, when your hive is taken down by inclement weather you may reconsider.""Why not?""What does, then?""On Nidavellir magic *is* technology and vice versa.""Oh. Want me to tell you how other people taste instead?""They aren't totally inferior, but this planet's technology is leagues behind that of Nidavellir.""I don't have time to do a demolition job.""I'm just being honest, it's not my fault if people are violent about it.""Why are you red Sparky?""Then you are a fool to keep two forces separate that are stronger together. To give a midgardian example, think of-" *His visor flashes through a few screens as he looks for a good comparison* "Peanut butter and Chocolate. Different things entirely, but work fantastically as one.""There's a difference between how much one can do and how much they bother to use. There's nothing I would gain from destroying this city, so why would I bother? Even if I could do it at the press of a button there's no reason to do it."*She pouts at him*"I accept that. At least I didn't attack someone in the street for not liking my suit."*He rolls his eyes* "Why are humans such pests sometimes?" *He turns and walks back*"My god you really are delusional.""Sure." *He says disbelievingly*"Why?"*She waves back happily*[he looks like someone who is 6'1", he's not out of his armor]
"Still, you should probably find other shelter. Just in case.""I feel a mix of disappointment, sadness, and mild nausea." "If you don't I will bite you!""How is sarcasm making me a 'caustic douchnozzle'? Maybe I just don't like people and perhaps I have good reason not to." "I heard that. Now what do you want?""Why would I step out of my armor?""No. I don't see any reason to-" *He is interrupted by a small blinking light on his visor* "Damn."[oh! she's back? I thought she was still pretending to be dead!]"Did you call me back to look at your creation for a reason or did you just want to insult me childishly?""This doesn't run out of power. I would not mind having somewhere to preform maintenance though.""You have a mate?""If by that you mean literally less than thirty seconds ago, yes."[oops... I accidentally missed that...]*He doesn't really seem to care as he keeps walking*"That would do adequately. I will have to remember to keep my moonlight key use a bit lower.""Your point?""Is she another giant bee?""... Humans truly are an odd race."*He follows, still looking generally imposing along the way.**Once they get there he says* "You live here?""So much degenerate behavior.""Is that all?"[oh, I thought they were in Millenium...]

"A good idea.""I know that much."*She grins, her teeth turning into dagger-like spikes*"I don't care.""Girlfriends? Odd. I thought such relationships were still disapproved of on this planet, nice to see they are being more progressive"

[aw, i was hoping Alice and/or Freya would make fun of his cuteness too]"They are strange about many topics.""That statement made no sense. If you believed I was someone who lacked the will to cause chaos then you would have no reason to warn me against taking such an action.""And you're sure nobody will call you a 'caustic douchnozzle' for that attitude?" *He says with a small grin*"Indeed, the moonlight key is a bit needlessly flashy.""No, easy to understand, but that doesn't make it less annoying.""No, the suit handles that on its own, but being in it at the time would be incredibly uncomfortable." *As he speaks, the suit seems to become more... Liquid. It 'melts' off of him and forms into a small ball behind him, leaving the diminutive dwarf standing at his real height in somewhat baggy black robes*"I am Brokkr, greatest smith of the Dwarves of Nidavellir.""That way." *He points the right direction* "Two blocks."*He looks at her, looking very annoyed. Unfortunately this looks unbelievably cute.*"Put me down! I am Brokkr, greatest craftsman of the dwarves!" *He tries, and fails, to wriggle free*[it's okay, he'll get better!]"A human one?""I think you may need to consider what is to blame on magic and what is to blame on personal issues.""A block is a measurement of distance."*She creeps closer, opening her mouth*"Not particularly. Many people I respect far more than you dislike me far more than you do.""I AM NOT CUTE!" *He tries to swing at her, failing due to his small size*"What, Gullhamr?" *He says with a grin, lifting his large gauntlet palm-up as three droplets of golden metal float up from it and circle above his palm* "You could not even begin to understand it."*He examines the arm* "Hm. Basic work, but not absolutely terrible."*He sighs in annoyance* "How fast do you fly?""THOR PUT ME DOWN THIS INSTANT BEFORE I MAKE A BETTER VERSION OF MJOLNIR FOR LOKI!""Why not learn to do it yourself?""Tell me, how would you explain a Tesla coil to a caveman?"*He growls at her in anger*"Personal, mostly. I wanted to see what the Midgardians were doing and take a break from home.""Thor, do not pick me up. I am a Dwarf, not a stuffed animal.""What will you do if you lose contact with him then?"*He narrows his eyes at her in annoyance*"And if it requires repairs?""No, right now. Explain to me how you would explain something that advanced to him. You may even change it to explaining to a king in the dark ages if you like, an entire few thousand years of advancement.""Fair enough.""Do you have a curse then?"*She closes in to bite his cheek* "Do I look like a hack? I do not make something so simple."*Lilith comes out of the kitchen with another cake*"Well, that sounds terrible for you."*She bites, not too hard but enough to draw blood*"I do not enjoy being treated like this.""Have you not noticed the massive golden armor suit?""They are certainly fine works, I was worried before coming here that all midgardian magic would be poor and savage.""Will you tell me now?""What does my attitude have to do with being treated like a toy?""It's not gold, I'm not an idiot.""Then either fix it or stop complaining.""Huh..?" *She seems confused* "I do not believe in Karma.""If you managed to make this I would be amazed." *He says as he holds up his arm. The metal on it seems to "melt" and begin to shift like fluid, changing into a sword*"No, what just happened was harassment and assault."*Lilith places it down and grabs a cookie and massive glass of milk, coming to sit near her*"And is randomly attacking people in the street helping with that?""I don't understand...?""Nidavellir, and it's only made by a single person."*Lilith comes out of the kitchen and looks rather sad that someone is burning one of the cookies**She puts it down and writes on her notepad BUT IT TASTES GOOD*"I am acting like what you would expect from someone in my situation." *He says with a bit of a pout**Lilith looks very sad*"You don't have to patronize me about it..." *He seems mildly upset. He looks for somewhere to sit down**"Oh wonderful, this one is going to go on a rant about their half-cocked magical theories no doubt"* *He thinks to himself*"Puzzles? Do I look like a child?" *She looks annoyed*"Exactly.""Explain it! Or you get another bite!"*"Oh great, they're going to start into Norse mythology now. This will get weird"* *Still thinking to himself*"Sparky! I'll get mad at you!""What?""Hm? Not quite.""Speed. Fly in a circle for a bit.""We are all wrong at some point. It's natural.""So... You don't care how I feel...?" *Now she looks sad**He sits on it, his feet don't touch the ground* "I will, but give me some time to."*He quickly does some calculations* "Two minutes that way, big building with books and two lion statues out front""Are you going somewhere with this?"*He is still walking past her, she will probably have to say something first*"Hm. It seems some human technology isn't *completely* savage" *He muses to himself*"That was kind of the obvious implication.""Just go and try not to choke yourself on a plastic bag on the way there."*He rolls his eyes*"Just go. You'll be fine. Probably.""Alright. Mind if I ask how you made those two?""Everything alright?""Do you have any idea how much this is worth?""Then don't put it on your head and you will be fine.""Not particularly."*Lilith throws a few handfuls of confetti* "Are you really that scared of going alone?"*Lilith looks a bit upset at the news broadcast suddenly cutting away*"If I wanted to make more.""From the monkeys?""I don't think you understand what I am saying. The problem is not "*can* I make more", it is "*do I want to* make more", understand?""Interesting, and theoretically repeatable." "Close enough.""I doubt there is much to learn for me here.""Can't really say that I care much.""It is good to see humans straying from their older stagnant barbaric practices. A majority of humans have been using the same few magics for centuries."[he probably couldn't. it's not a matter of how well he understands it, it's that the person he's explaining it to doesn't even know the basics you would need to understand the most simple facts of it.]"Your welcome, bee.""All of it can do nearly anything."[exactly, but that is the point that Brokkr is trying to make. He can't explain the armor in a way that he will understand without years of teaching.][end?]"We will see about that.""It wouldn't make very good armor if it couldn't."[i don't see how that changes Brokkr's point..?]"Do you have anything to eat?"*She looks very sad*"Nor as badly as you could have, but badly."*She stays away when he tries*"Just don't do it again."[sorry... it wasn't a fight...]"Try to keep that in check""You don't care how I feel so you don't get to hug me!"[sorry...]"Then why did you say you don't care if you make me mad?""Now, if you don't mind, I have a busy day ahead of me."[i didn't intend for it to be a contest...]"Still deciding.""I can make my own choices!""Well, what would *you* suggest?""Is there anything wrong with that?"[so, back to where we left off..?]"And?"*She is still pouting at him*[so, his response...?]"Why?"*"Well, someone's a bit insecure."* *He thinks to himself.*

[also, he is still in his armor.]*More pouting*[okay][ah, I thought she was referring to him being short even by Dwarf standards]"Why are you crying?""And..?"[well, her assumption was this time correct]"No, I'm mad at you. There's a difference.""Do you like fashion?"[so, end now basically..?]"Sparky! Stop crying!""Well, guide me through the basics of earth fashion then." *He sounds a bit resigned to this**She pouts and begins examining it, trying to figure it out*[hello! want something terrible and fun to happen?][oh, that's not my intent. What if on her way out she ran into Hati who was going back in to visit Joseph again, or even if we "rewound" a bit so they run into each other just as she's leaving the room?]*Hati, seemingly back to her usual cheery not-crazy self is happily walking into the hospital*"Hm?" *Hati looks towards her, actually looking somewhat worried**Hati backs out of the way in a blur* "Hey! Calm down!""What's wrong with you? I just want to see how Sparky is doing without being attacked!""I was upset!""Why not?""Why not?""I was UPSET!" *She seems to be upset now too*"Yes I do!""I didn't know! I was upset! And have *you* cared about how *I* feel about this?""And then you went off to the ceremony with Thor!""SHE FORCED ME TO! I wanted to go with her!""Check.""YES. SHE. DID! And I wanted to help her! She was in trouble so I wanted to help!" *She seems to be on the verge of crying*

[as a side note, Thor actually did basically tell her not to come to the ceremony.]"Who?""Gold has meaning.""Since when? You didn't lose me Sparky, you're being silly.""I tried already and it doesn't!""Do I look like a glutton?" "No, I'm mad at you for being silly and too dramatic, that's not as bad as hate.""I have no qualms with being associated with money."*She paps him on the head and smiles* "Don't be so dramatic!""Why are you so upset? Everything is fine for you now!""And you took the only PERSON I felt safe with!""Are you going to try to tell me humans don't wear gold?" *He says, incredulously, his visor highlighting all the gold jewelry worn by people nearby*"Don't worry about it! Cheer up!""Well, I didn't know that she wanted to go! Not until the letter." 

[note, the letter was sent *before* Alice convinced Thor to break up with her, and *before* Hati trashed their apartments]"Which I am fine with. May we stop this circular argument?" "Really? Exactly *who's* life is hell now?" *She sounds a bit angry now*

[it's okay! also that bit before was a bit of a hint, an indirect way Alice might realize something is weird with the letter since it was sent before anything went wrong as a 'reconciliation attempt' but Hati says it was when she realized Thor didn't want her anymore]*She thinks, then begins tickling him*"It's fine, it was a misunderstanding.""Oh! Are you okay Sparky?""So, next step?""Why do you think that?!""Okay, lie down!"*She writes I KNOW, I LOVE THOSE TOO, BUT I ALSO LOVE COOKIES*"Mostly check.""Now, rest Sparky! I want you to get better!"*She looks at it, thinks for a bit, then vomits acid sludge into the first key case*"I will make you a deal!""I don't know how simple I need to be.""Yay!"

[I am sorry, I had to try it...]"Why. Do. You. THINK THAT?""I don't exactly spend much time watching midgardian television.""Try to get better, and I will not be mad at you for anything for the day!""I haven't exactly SEEN you since then!""Just... Gr..." *She is making kind of... Noises. She doesn't seem to be good at finding her words at the moment* 

[oh, don't worry, there is a plan for that.]"I was making a joke involving my lack of experience with midgardian culture in general. This is my first visit, after all.""So... Since I won't get mad, pleeeeease tell me what you meant?"*She fumbles for a bit more, then seems to have an idea. She begins looking through her pockets and says* "Give me your hand!""Now!" *She says more firmly, as she pulls a rather pretty ring out of her pocket*"Simple, but pretty.""Ooooooh! Sex?"*She growls a bit, and zips rather quickly towards her, trying to grab her hand.*"Interesting. Dwarves tend to prefer intricate designs in our art.""Why didn't you just say that's what you thought I meant? I didn't mean that, by the way."*Brokkr looks in his direction* "Funny, coming from someone dressed like that.""Why not?""Not right..?" *She seems confused*[the ring shares emotion. You feel the emotions of the other person as if you where feeling them. Well, for Hati it's a bit different. Since Hati is literally *made* of emotion, the person wearing the other ring feels the emotions with amazingly increased intensity, and can hear bits of Hati's inner subconscious thoughts. for a comparison of the increased intensity, if a normal person's emotions are like holding your hand near a bonfire, Hati is like diving into it headfirst]

*Hati takes the other ring out of her pocket and puts it on*"That is all up to personal opinion.""Humans are odd.""But we're the only people in here!"[what do you mean..? do you mean how she sees and such and her future sight? if so, no. The Hati thing is only because she's made of raw emotion]"You're silly then.""Why would you *not* want to show off your craftsmanship?" "It's actually incredibly comfortable.""I know it is.""Siiiilly." *She pokes his forehead**Which might happen. Hati is a veritable flood of emotion, on the surface at the moment is anger and distress, and below it- there's sadness, feelings of betrayal, fear, and mountains of guilt and self-loathing.*"Did I poke that hard...?""Okay! Rest up now!""Of course." *He looks more than a bit proud*[end?]"It would take quite a while to explain." *Despite looking like gold, it feels soft, almost like silk.*"Hm?" *He turns his head to her, looking a bit disinterested* "What?""Still behind the dwarves, but impressive for a human.""Fashion is not my primary concern, but thank you""Do I need to open these ones too? Annoying..." *She slimes those ones too**Upon feeling the burst, Hati's form shifts. For just that moment, she was... Nothing. Indescribable. A form that could not be described, save for the red scarf around it. After it, a small form is left curled up under a massive scarf.**Hati seems to go back to... "normal". She is normal shape and size, but deathly still. She occasionally seems to flicker a bit*"And you think I have done well with it?" *He sounds a bit proud**Hospital staff begin to try to fix the situation* 

[want to skip to other event now?][his face isn't covered by the armor]

"I could make you something similar, but not the same as this."[yes. he doesn't like wearing helmets because they feel too cramped, especially on his ears.]

"Ah-ah-ah, I do not work for free, no matter how easy it is for me.""Blech..." *She feels like vomiting just from the taste of, ironically, her magic vomit.*"Do you know many humans with pointed ears?""Did I stutter?""Pretty..?"[okay!]"Yes?""Well, nice to see Midgard is as educated as ever." *He says sarcastically*"That's... Good to know..? Humans have odd beauty standards.""One of what?""Not really.""I am not a super. I'm just superb.""What? It's True.""Not quite."[i would suggest going [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3rqbeg/emergency_inside/cwqdq0a)! Also, remember to say which week!]"It is a... Cultural issue." *He seems a bit uncomfortable about it*"I don't particularly care""*I* am from Nidavellir. Your "Norse" made legends about it. Thus, I am Nidavellirian, not Norse.""So, is there anything you wanted?"*He seems annoyed* "No, it is not. You are comparing a country of savages to a planet of the greatest craftsmen in the galaxy.""Actually, such makeup would be praised for its craftsmanship on Nidavellir.""I see- tattoo, curse, or birth defect?""Alright.""Don't be so proud, I don't feel like wasting time proving you wrong.""What's what like?"*Lilith, who through various shenanigans had failed to hear about wraith's not-death this whole time, spots her and looks a bit bewildered before running over to hug her*"What's it like living on earth?"*His eyes narrow at her in annoyance* "Alright, let's have a challenge. Greatest thing we can build- in 45 seconds." *He immediately cracks the oversized knuckles of his armor* "Ready?""And to me, living on Nidavellir is normal. I can't really compare it when this is my first visit to earth.""How quickly can you get equipment? You can borrow some of mine, if you like.""So, any reason you are interested in me other than the giant gold armor?""Would you like to borrow some equipment from me? Name the tools you will need.""Well, thank you for that I suppose.""I don't have the resources nor the inclination to make all of those within a few minutes, to your home it is.""What about you, anything particularly interesting about you?"[wait, where's the ring?]"Between worlds, yes. To a random house, probably if the moons were aligned correctly.""Cubert?""If they where I would not have bothered to make the distinction. Give me the address.""He waits"[nobody but Hati, Joseph, and now Alice know what the rings do]*His visor flashes through a few screens and he begins to walk off*"Odd." *His visor scans it and zooms in on it*"I'm headed there.""Why do you carry around a blob of acid with a name?"*She is kept in a solitary confinement room, but the whole thing looks a bit more like a science lab with the guards and various scientists trying to figure out what is going on. Inside her room strange noises and lights can be heard and seen through the edges around the door**One of the doctors outside the door stops him* "Whoa! I would suggest not trying that, the scarf doesn't seem to like most people.""So. A shapeshifting blob of acid.""Oh, I have no idea, if only you had a hovering vehicle with you, perhaps even under your feet right now." *He says sarcastically*"If you want to go in you'll need to bring a guard with you and you'll need to sign a waiver. Also, another waiver saying that you'll pay for the extra cleaning costs if this goes badly."[that would have helped... I will rewind a bit, one moment]"Where did you find it?" *He seems mildly interested**His visor flashes through a few screeens* "Too far, follow me." *He begins walking**The somewhat scared doctor gets him the forms and selects and unlucky guard to go in with him*[oh my! Yuuki's story is wonderful! Akki likely bought it then felt inadequate] [it's alright]"So you don't know where it came from?"*He begins to lead her to a fairly large but somewhat run-down looking building*"My workshop.""Hm... Disappointing."*They eventually open the cell to let him in, inside Hati is... Well, it's hard to describe. It's more of a shifting shape with a scarf around it at the moment. The scarf seems to be almost patrolling as it circles through the air. The guard averts his eyes from it uncomfortably, Joseph may notice that looking directly at it for too long feels... Uncomfortable.**The shape that was once Hati doesn't really respond.**The scarf zips in the way threateningly, the guard says* "Just stay away from the... er... Neck? And that thing will leave you alone. Usually."*It seems wary of him, but doesn't attack.*"Why would you think that?"[so.. would you just like to end this..?]"May I have it..?"[did you drop this..?]*After letting go Lilith writes I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD! on her notepad*[okay...]"Spooky it's not that hard!" *She chastises him as she walks*"Darnit spooky!" *She tries vomit-blasting near him as she walks, apparently refusing to accept the idea of a screen**Brokkr seems to be investigating a small street magician's show, he looks unimpressed**She goes to take the ladder* "Even with my new boots my feet are getting tired."*It's minor charms at best, and simple sleight of hand at worst. Still, from a the perspective of the few humans watching him it would probably be pretty impressive.*"Ah yes, swords and sorcery with a high tech golden armor and visor." *He says sarcastically**Despite not knowing her well, Lilith seems rather happy to see she is not dead.*"On Nidavellir magic and technology are one thing.""Any idea how it happened?""My home planet."*It isn't attacking him, but it doesn't want to let him closer either*"What?"*Lilith smiles under her mask and nods, then writes HOW DID YOU SURVIVE THAT...? I HEARD YOU GOT STABBED!**No response*"If you say so.""Assuming they didn't let go there's no reason they couldn't 'hitchhike' with my moonlight key.""So, back to fashion then?""That is exceedingly unlikely to happen. And if it did, there are others capable of travelling between worlds."*No verbal response. It does move a bit in reaction to his words, though. Perhaps it can't speak when it's being worn?*"A few. No dwarves as far as I know though"*Lilith actually seems a bit in awe. She's not the brightest, that's for sure*"Mostly boredom. The rest is personal business.""Thank you.""Well, even if you can't it's thankfully not too bad of a curse." *He leans down a bit to look at his face closer, his visor flickering through a few scans* "Are there any other effects?""Not particularly." *She nods*"A shame... Does this effect work through clothing?""Does it effect everything?" *He seems to be studying him rather analytically now, he looks rather interested.*"Farewell." *He continues down the street*"Interesting..." *His visor scans to see if his hand is actually cold or only appears so through the deathly magic* "Have you attempted any manner of counterspells?""Magic made to counter the effects of your curse. Does your lowered temperature effect your bodily functions, by the way? Immune system and required clothing to remain comfortable, that kind of thing.""Interesting." *He takes off his visor and headset, revealing his pointed ears* "Mind if I check?"*He looks very offended suddenly* "I am *not* an elf, Midgardian.""I am a Dwarf. Our ears are not *nearly* as pointed as an elf's ears. I am not sure why humans always make this mistake, but I will let it slide since it was not your fault that you where uneducated on the subject." *He still looks a bit upset about it**He narrows his eyes a bit* "Not all human myths are accurate." *He holds up his gauntlet, and some of the metal from it floats up and turns into a stethoscope* "Now, may I listen to your heartbeat?"*He puts the stethoscope's tips in his ears and holds the diaphragm (the round bit) up to Amadi* "This will be easier if this touches your skin, hearing through fabric is difficult."[well, you would have to ask Mr.Blade]"Check, most definitely."*There is again no response, but the scarf coils around Hati protectively**He holds the diaphragm to his chest to hear his heartbeat* "I apologize if it is cold." [well, even if they *saw* what happened they wouldn't necessarily know what the rings do. All they would see is "ring goes on, everything goes crazy". I can ask Mr.Blade though]*It doesn't stop him*"Done." *He says with a bit of a smirk, wearing his armor*"Interesting... Do you experience any general health issues?"[okay! I talked to Mr.Blade and he basically said that nobody thought to ask Joseph what the ring is yet, but probably will some way through week 1.]"Do you need to breath?" *He moves the stethoscope to listen to his lungs* "Also, would you mind taking a few deep breaths?"[oh! okay!]*The scarf is wary, but doesn't stop him. Contacting her is an incredibly strange and rather unpleasant feeling, like every sensation you could imagine and some you cant happening a dozen times a second.*"What can I say, I am Brokkr for a reason.""Hm... Well, lungs and heart are working, though slowly. Would you mind if I did some more tests? This curse of yours is starting to interest me."*The scarf seems a bit wary, coiling a bit tighter*"I am not a doctor of humans, but I can preform some of the basics of a physical. Probably somewhere quieter though, Human streets are too loud for my tastes."*There is no response*"That wasn't sarcasm.""I was refering to the fact that I am Brokkr, greatest craftsman of the dwarves."[want to skip to week 2?]"Mine is more of a... Workshop. Yours would probably be more comfortable.""Mostly because it hasn't stopped being True yet."[okay!]

*Joseph gets a message from one of the doctors stating that Hati's condition has improved*"I will attempt not to.""What do you mean by 'real name'?"*He is told to go to the coma ward**She is resting in a bed, the one next to her has Alice. Hati looks like her normal self, but is rather pale. She is still wearing the scarf*"Offense taken.""It looks comfortable."*She is still asleep, one of the doctors approaches him* "She's in a coma, she's.... probably better than before, but we don't know when or if she will wake up. In fact, to be honest, we aren't entirely sure she's... Well, alive.""Apology considered for acceptance.""I'm not sure why you thought I would make fun of it, it looks excellent." "Your master?"*She is still wearing it*"I am aware."*The feelings from her are much more weak and scattered, but not gone.*"That Midgardians are ignorant to other cultures? Yes, I get that.""Don't worry, it's not your fault.""Have they tried countering your curse?"*The scarf suddenly lashes out at him, trying to grab the ring*"If you would like me to explain, I could give a quick version.""Odd. Would you like to begin the examination?" *some of the metal of his suit floats up and forms a [blood pressure checker thing that I can't remember the name of](http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5d/d7/blood_6.jpg?itok=-tVI_qmZ)**It pulls the ring away, putting it on the bedside.*"I am from Nidavellir, planet of the dwarves. Humans long ago had contact with some travelers from one of the nine worlds of Yggdrasil other than their own, and attained bastardized versions of many of our myths.""This is just the outside." *He walks over to the door and the finger of his armor produces a key, which he uses to open the door*"Don't be, it was to be expected.""Well, that's good to know.""How so? You're not the one with nonsensical myths told about your people by another species from another world."*It is a rather large space, with all manner of tools and machinery for building, including a few she likely doesn't recognize from Nidavellir.*"What?""I try. Now, choose your starting position and tell me when you would like to begin."*She might also notice that the curtains around the bed next to Alice's have been pulled back by a nurse at some point while she was asleep, and a certain red-scarfed individual is unconscious in that bed.*"What does?""From where? I have some here.""As I have learned." *She doesn't look very healthy- she's pale and her chest, if it is moving, is doing so imperceptibly.**He rolls his eyes a bit*"We don't know how long that could be, and unless you're legally related I can't let you stay past visiting hours.""Back there" *He points to the opposite wall, which has large amounts of raw materials of various kinds. He himself walks over to it and grabs a large chunk of iron, about 1'x6"x6"**Hati doesn't move, but her scarf shifts a bit on its own*"Is that all?""I have a feeling that Midgardians misunderstand most things.""It tends to not attack people who don't get too close to her neck.""Ready? 45 seconds once we begin. We may increase it to one minute if you wish." *He grabs no tools**It doesn't shift again. Maybe it was a trick of the light?*"Farewell then." 

[end?]"But also True."*The scarf shifts back. That definitely moved that time.*"Ready, set, begin-" *His gauntlet suddenly seems to melt over the iron block, and large amounts of movement and cutting can be heard within it as chunks of metal scrap begin to slide out*"I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean I can change procedures." *The second she tries to touch it it whips away, rearing up like a snake**The amount of iron being ejected becomes far less about 30 seconds in, and tendrils extend from his armor, latching onto the tops of spray-paint cans nearby*"Not by nature, by culture."*It suddenly coils around Hati's neck again more tightly, still 'looking' upset.**He looks bemused* "I'll call you if her condition changes, okay?"*He grins* "You're not being beaten by magic, you're being beaten by technology."*It tries to evade her**Meat Lovers. Lots of it. Lilith is having a feast.*"A caveman would call a normal lighter magic or fire manipulation."*Instead, it suddenly grasps onto the bed next to it and pulls, dragging Hati out of the bed and away from Freya*"Yes, just only during visiting hours, not 24/7."*It continues latching onto things to drag her away across the floor. Maybe messing with it isn't a smart idea...?*"So, what have you made in a minute?""Romantic?" *He says incredulously* *One enters shortly* "Yes, is there a-" *He sees the scarf in the corner coiled protectively around Hati and groans* "Did you *have* to touch it?""Fancy." *The golden material of his gauntlet returns to normal, and below is a beautifully crafted and painted statue of sorts of a small child holding a flute. He turns a small wind-up key on the back, and the statue begins to move with shockingly realistic motions and play a song on the flute*"We... Don't really know. We just know it doesn't like being touched and it really doesn't like people touching Hati's neck.""Wonderful." *He says dryly*"This suit is my... Magnum Opus, I believe humans would call it. It isn't exactly for sale.""Just... Did you *really* have to do that? Now I need to try to get it back into bed..." *He sounds rather exasperated by this prospect*"Don't worry, I'm sure she'll get better eventually.""Humans have a tendency to try to evade responsibility for these kinds of things.""The cost is not measurable in human currency." "No, you didn't know, it's fine..." *He still looks upset* "I'll wait for it to calm down a bit first.""Well, we'll see if it comes to that.""Well, you could always try to build something better.""So... Why *did* you touch it?""Hm?""That is my job, you know.""What?""Do you always grab stuff that moves on its own?""Alright then.""Sir, please calm down." *He seems generally bemused*"You can't make blueprints for an invention yourself?"*He sighs*"You'll never know until you try.""Nah, just... I need to rest a bit." *He sits nearby* "Almost everyone who walks by is setting the damn thing off at least a little recently""Sir don't make me call security""You also committed multiple illegal acts.""It's just so... Skittish. There are a couple people it doesn't mind though.""Your reforming constructs.""What?""Well, that kid Joseph for sure.""Indeed. It was mostly meant as a joke.""Bribery and harassment first of all.""Which doesn't make it less True. If you intend to do nothing but lament the quality of your works they will never get better.""Some kid, he comes in to talk to Hati all the time. The scarf is practically calm as a kitten around him.""Also, I believe I am owed an apology." "He's... Kind of an asshole sometimes though. I hear he tried to bribe one of the doctors one time.""For?" *He says with a grin*"To let him stay here longer. He also threatened one about it at some point.""Sure it could." *He says sarcastically* "And for the record, it was the suit, not just the gauntlet.""He's... kind of odd. It's a bit sweet though."*He sighs* "Please, just calm down, you can still visit her I just don't want you to make a scene.""An interesting prospect.""Yes.""Making the suit?""So... Guess I should get her back now."*He gives him a "really?" kind of look*"Many dwarves use mercury for tasks due to this. Being naturally a liquid makes it easy to utilize." "It took years to get it to work correctly. The results where..." *He smiles affectionately as he looks at one of his gauntlets, the fingers of which fly off and float around his hand a bit in a rather pretty display* "Even better than I could have hoped.""Hold on, I know how to do this-" *He walks out and quickly comes back with a small cup of yogurt* "No, it is a fairly original idea for a human."*He rolls his eyes and goes back to taking care of Hati and Alice**He smiles a bit at that* "Many people were. It was rather enjoyable."*He doesn't feel like potentially being attacked by the scarf.*"Others have had more original ideas."*He places the yogurt near the bed and backs off a few steps. He seems to be waiting**Well, we could see one of the other times he comes back if he wants to see something a bit cute**Eventually the scarf begins cautiously crawling Hati back to the bed*"How 'like this' do you mean?""Don't worry about it, very few people can think of something completely original." "She likes Yogurt."*The next day, when he arrives is slightly before when Hati's next meal is scheduled. Now that they're sure she's alive they're being sure to set a regular feeding schedule, since the scarf won't let them give her an IV*"What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.""That doesn't help."*It eventually crawls close enough to the bed to drag Hati back into it, then the scarf picks up the yogurt and begins to pour some into Hati's mouth.*"Why? It's simply something very few beings are capable of."*She hasn't changed her condition. A nurse comes in with a plate containing some yogurt and a glass of juice*"In that case, very few. To give a sense of perspective, this was declared the greatest piece of craftsmanship on the planet."*It massages her throat to get her to swallow it, then pulls the covers back over her* "Oh thank god, sometimes that takes hours.""We figured out how to do it last night, it was tough but I think you might like the results." *The nurse says with a somewhat tired smile before placing the tray over Hati's lap and stepping back*"So, you may also understand the implications of your earlier claims.""Not being able to be 100% original doesn't make you part of the masses, most people just make an original blend of unoriginal ideas.""No worries, this time it calmed down pretty quick.""What does that mean?""Good."*The scarf slowly begins to move, making its way over to the food*"So long."

[end?]"What?""That is a difficult question, there are many different kinds of craftsmen." "I don't think you understand what I mean. Unless you are trained in all *kinds* of crafts, from mechanics to fashion design, there is no way you are better than *most* of them at their respective craft.""So, you are probably not better than most of them.""It's nothing to be ashamed of.""Alright, calm down then.""Good. Now, is there anything else you wanted?""Alright, I have important things to do then. Please leave my workshop.""You still did it on your own, though."*It grabs the yogurt an bring it to Hati's lips, pouring some in for her**He notices that she isn't, and seems a bit puzzled that nobody else seems to care**He is fairly openly staring, somewhat inquisitively*"I'm wondering why the midgardians aren't noticing you. It's an odd phenomenon." *Plus, she's lazy**He, surprisingly, doesn't look very intimidated* "Brokkr, greatest craftsman of the Dwarves of Nidavellir. And you?""Not in all procedures, but I know basic Midgardian biology." *He puts his visor on and it also begins flashing through a few medical textbooks*
"It's just a physical, not surgery. Now, give me your arm."*He straps the device on and takes his blood pressure*"Hm... Expected. Do you experience any other death-related effects?" *He says as the tool reshapes into a tool for an eye exam* "Alright, look forward." *He looks into his eyes with it*"Other than coloration they are totally normal. Does it affect your dietary habits?""Alright, the only other thing I'd like to check is bone structure. I can just scan for this one." *His visor does a quick examination, looking for any irregularities in Amadi's skeleton* "Also, does your death effect extend to your teeth, nails, and hair?""I meant if it kills things on contact like your skin does. Would you mind explaining all the previous wounds you've had?""Very well. So, does your hair have the same magical properties as your skin?""Interesting.""Not in a bad way. Potentially in a good way.""No, I meant that it might be good that it doesn't extend to your hair." *He begins examining Amadi's hair, closely looking at a handful of it*"Hm..." *He examines it as he talks* "Your hair is rather healthy by the way, keep using whatever products you are at the moment."*Lilith hears the shift, snapping to attention. She suddenly charges the tree, ramming into it in an attempt to knock him out*

/u/AccioSun "Nidavellir is by home, and a Dwarf is one of the wisest beings in the galaxy.""You are a craftsman?""It most certainly does. All kinds of craftsmen and women are appreciated on Nidavellir, our fashion is a rather popular scene to some of the other worlds.""It's usually rather intricate, Dwarves don't tend to like plain things.""Fun. Want to see some of it?"*He presses a button on his visor, then takes it off and hands it over**He is not quite sure how to respond. The visor is showing an array of outfits, all gorgeously crafted, and most of them intricate and ostentatious enough to look like something royalty would wear. The outfits all seem a bit small though*[so... did you accidentally drop this thingy...?][did you drop this..?]*She has completely disregarded the sign's warning already and just goes to stick the first key in the first lock*"Well, out of those we have met. I admit it is possible that we have yet to encounter some more intelligent being.""On Nidavellir those who can make such works wear them to show their skill, and on rare occasions will give them to their friends."OOC: done! yay!

IC: *Lilith writes SOMETHING TO MAKE ME FASTER**Akki, looking as generally spooked as ever, is walking down the street near him. She's heard of the bombings and, despite being amazingly tough, is still scared of them*"Eep!" *She is mostly scared and tries to stay on the other side of the street*"Well, not everyone bothers much with fashion. It really depends on who you talk to."*She tries to stay away without drawing too much attention to herself while taking out her phone to call the police**As is she, as she says into her phone* "[h-hello?! Police? I'm beging chased by a scary man, please help!]"*She screams while telling the police where she is, she really does forget that she has superpowers sometimes*"I am not a bird!""SIR PLEASE GO AWAY!" *She is getting a bit angry...**Not yet. She does suddenly stop, turning around with a large punch aimed at his gut* "I said STOP!""Hmph. And what makes you think that I *haven't* proven myself to be the best?" *He actually seems a bit offended* *She is thrown back a bit, has some of her clothes ruined and covered in gore, but she seems relatively unharmed. Totally mentally scarred however.*"Ow! Hey, I did the puzzle right! Stupid puzzle room..."*She seems mostly stunned for a bit, she apparently thinks she just made him explode*"By Midgardian years, thirty."*It's not really that hard, still kind of stunned and everything.**That, however, gets her attention* "Huh..?" *She looks at him*"H-hey! Get off me!""G-go away!" *She tries to run**She tries one of those, not paying attention to which one she's using but being sure not to use the first lock*"I am not a philosopher, but I have certainly proven myself best at what I do.""Wh-who are you...?""Huh...?""Eep!" *It kind of just bounces off* "Wh-what was that for?!""I make things of a specific nature. That is why I am Brokkr.""Why?!"*She pouts and goes to actually examine the keys and locks, to see if there's any kind of pattern*"All Dwarves are crafters. I am just the greatest."*She uses the old-fashioned one on one of the locks*"I don't I really don't just please don't try to hit me again!""To do what?!""Why..?!""Ha! Good.""D-did you make that man do that before...?"*His eyes narrow* "Then I'll have to beat them too."*She lowers her head a bot, covering it with her hood. She suddenly seems to grow as one of her hands grasps a nearby streetsign and grips it hard enough to bend the metal* "Why would you do that..?""For what?" *Red horns grow out around her hood*"SO you go and hurt a bunch of innocent people?" *The sign, weakened by the explosion, rips right out of the ground when she gives it a sharp tug*"You... You MONSTER!" *She suddenly seems very angry and changes into her full Oni mode, her now larger clawed feet ripping her shoes apart and her skin turning bright red. She runs at him, stop sign in hand**She is faster than them, but doesn't want to risk being right next to another explosion. She throws the stop sign at one of them with considerable force*"It's not my primary concern, but I could probably handle it.""I don't want a rival, if someone ends up being better than me then I want to get good enough to never have to worry about them again.""Crafting, usually of technology."*She pouts and tries the last key on the fourth lock*"I don't need someone else to better myself, if I did then how would it be any better than letting someone else make me better?""What makes you think the best can't get better?""Good! Now where are the others?" *She goes to check if they went back to the puzzle*"Well, it made this." *He says, pointing to his armor*"I have reason to be that confident.""On Nidavellir they're the same thing."*Oh... In that case, she goes through the door*"Another world.""Do you not believe me?"*He narrows his eyes a bit* "I won't be offended if you don't.""Do you really think fighting is all that is important?"*Lilith is scared and mad still, so she just starts ripping off small chunks of the tree, destabilizing it* *She doesn't really even pause before walking through Amber's one*"You know, there are other extraterrestrials living on earth already, like your "durinko man"."

Tell you what, I'll agree you're a vampire for now, but I'm not getting you alcohol." "I still want to play it safe, I wouldn't buy alcohol for a grown woman I just met either.

Do you always blush blue?""Humans can be a vampire's master?"*Bernard sits up, coughing up a bit of blood, and begins mumbling something. Daemon's wounds begin to heal*"Shhh. Your heart is kind, I could not let you die.""So... *Why* did you make him your master?""Hm... Yes, you are, unless I'm mistaken."[we never finished the Akki thread I think, but we can probably just leave it as 'she signed up and her cover story with her family is that she is studying abroad', is that okay..?]

*[Akki](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3f9juj/akki_ayumu/) is here, in demi-oni form for once. She is wandering the base, generally avoiding people about of social awkwardness* 
*He raises an eyebrow* "Are you feeling alright?""I'm just trying to figure out why you would choose to have a master."[tagging again]

/u/jellysnake"Sounds sweet." *He says with a small smile*"How long have you been a vampire?"okay! where, when, and what situation? so, city, midnight, and will they be acting IC?"Before WW2? Seriously?" alright, if they'll be IC then we would need a reason for them to fight, it could be as simple as a misunderstanding. "How about WW1?"[note, as is these characters will just disappear from canon after their fight, but if someone really likes one of them *and* the character survives their match, you can probably talk to me and the mods about re-submitting one of them as a full-blown character under your control.] if they're fighting it would probably be against Skoll, Simon's alter-ego and also kind of alternate personality, not against Simon. "Thank you.?" *He seems unsure what the correct response to this is* "Interesting. Do you clot correctly?"it's okay! basically when he puts on his mask he becomes Skoll, which  is kind of an alter ego and kind of an alternate personality. "And how old were you when you were bitten?"*He thinks for a few seconds* "So, we know that there's only about a decade of time it could have been. That narrows it down quite a bit."he tries not to let anyone know he's skoll, if she attacked while he was Simon he would just run. however, I know what we could do! just a mild change to the original version- She dropped her wallet, he found it while in Skoll mode, recognized her picture in it and went to return it, when she sees a stranger walking around with her wallet she thinks he stole it! does that work?*She sees if the clouds are soft**He shrugs* "Sometimes it's good to know where you came from."Okay!

*At around Midnight, Skoll is walking to Illya's house to return her wallet, which is in his hand at the moment*"Just making sure. Those kinds of conditions can be very harmful." "Maybe you should go back there some time.""Soooooft." *She flops onto them for a while before going to investigate the necklace*[the mask looks like a motorcycle helmet in Skoll form]

*He just keeps walking, not recognizing her* "And not everyone is pressed in a fight."[it's okay!]

"Hm?" *He turns towards her* "Nah, just handling some business."*She, being the greedy and totally doesn't-care-about-potential-repercussions girl she is, grabs it.*"I either win a fight or lose a fight, it's simple. Building something, on the other hand, is not. That is when I have to push myself, to find not just a way to do the task at hand, but the *best* way to do the task at hand.""Are you new here...?"*Of course.*yay! how many approvals will they need?"Sorry, the helmet doesn't really come off."okay! I actually forgot that he had an 8! "Listen, I don't want any trouble." *He puts his hands up, speaking calmly. Of course, he does still have the wallet in one of his hands.*"I try not to do it, nor to keep track of it.""This? A wallet. It's why I'm here.""Still worth checking. Now, would you like to see Nidavellir?""Steal? I didn't steal it!" *As he says this, the wallet flips open on accident, showing her picture in it* "Blech!" *She tries to take it off**He hands over the visor, the pictures are all of grand and beautiful buildings and streets, architectural and mechanical marvels of a breathtaking level. It's like the whole planet is one huge art display almost. There is one odd thing though, none of the pictures have a sky, they all seem to be underground or indoors.* "Ya, not to sound rude, but it doesn't exactly look like it's yours.""Above the surface. We can't go there, it's too dangerous.""And did you give it your all there?"*She pouts again**He ducks back, out of the way* "Whoa! Cool it, there's no need to get violent.""Then the thing which shows what you really are is not battle, it is a challenge."*She looks to see what is different*"Why?"*He uses the change in balance from his duck backwards to continue into a backflip* "Woo! Knew that would be useful one day.""Our planet has no magnetic field. If we went above our surface, the radiation would be lethal after a short amount of time."*She makes [displeased noises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk_QyPykxZA) at this general situation and moves onward*"And? There's nothing in that that said you can only fight."*He raises his arm, which suddenly has a large shield on it to block the blows* "Last chance, calm down.""Sure. But your point still makes no sense."*She pouts heavily at this, also she tries to see if cloud stuff means she can fly, or barring that if her suit can still let her fly**He responds with a headbutt from his helmet, while he begins to hold his hands together and a loud orb of light forms between them**She sees if there's any other way out of the room than down, if not she floats down**He sits down* "All I am saying is that I see no reason you cannot better yourself in other ways. I doubt that you are any less intelligent than most midgardians.""So, I take it you don't feel like calming down?" *He says as a [baton](http://www.safta-inc.com/assets/images/Baton2.jpg) crackling with the occasional spark of electricity forms in his hand from the ball of light*"Then you are challenging yourself, good."okay! thank you Mr.Gal! I will get the first battle up later today!"I seriously doubt that you cannot find a rival."*The one she came through?**He holds his shield up, but the sheer force of it sets him off balance. As he begins to fall back he desperately swings the crackling baton at her*"It's perfectly safe below the surface."*Akki at this point has kind of 'settled' in the kitchen. She is staring at the fridge a bit sheepishly, when her stomach suddenly grumbles loudly*[okay!]*She whips around with a kick aimed at its head, she's learned not to aim for the stomach**Unfortunately, the Ditto clone distracting her from the tree meant he didn't have much noise to cover his jump. Lilith's sensitive ears tracked it, and after a single swift kick to the Ditto clone's chest she barrels into that tree*

She is considering trying to steal one of the jets at this point*[thank you!]

/u/jellysnake*She walks over, looking distressed still**Once Tim shows up at the hospital, at this point near sundown, the earpiece crackles to life once it's in range. At first there's just a few rambled mumblings, but then whoever is on the other side realizes that their earpiece is on too* "O-oh! y-y-y-you're the guy, r-r-right..? The one I have to f-f-fight?" *His voice is shaky and his breathing sounds scared*"S-sorry about this all, T-Tim. Do you m-mind if I call you Tim..?" *Near the entrance to the hospital is a folder with Tim's name on it, inside is a map of the hospital**"KATIE IS MISSING."**"I DO. AND SHE'S MY SQUAD LEADER AND MY FRIEND"**It's a fairly straightforward map, as he looks at it Vincent keeps talking* "I-I'm Vincent, but e-everyone calls me V-V-Vince. Wh-where are you n-now, Tim...?"*"CAN I THINK IT AT YOU..? I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOUR POWERS WORK"**She thinks for a bit, then thinks to her "FOLLOW" before leading her back to the Feral Flares' area and rifling through a small box for a picture. As she looks she tells Raven through her thoughts how long Katie has been gone, and the fact that she was last heard to be going to the mall**She takes out a small picture of Katja, and thinks "YES!"**The place has lighting surprisingly, but it's pretty dim. As she steps in, she might be able to hear a somewhat distance whirring noise growing steadily louder**Lilith lets her take it, but thinks "PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH IT"**Well, she doesn't have to look long, as the whirring ends with a sudden BOOM as the wall a few feet to the left of her seemingly explodes, as well as several walls in front of her having holes blasted right through them. Clouds of dust and wall chunks fill the air**The cloud clears a bit, and with the dust out of the way she can see- it seems something shot a hole through those walls, and through the holes she can just see a bit of it- a single glowing red light on a mechanical plate. A deep synthesized voice rings out* "SHOT FAILED. TARGET STILL CONSCIOUS. BEGINNING PURSUIT." *Loud metallic steps can be heard**She thinks "BUT WHAT IF IT'S DANGEROUS...?"*While diving through the holes lets her get closer, the last couple ones are too small to go through. She'll have to try to find her way around**She still looks, and feels, very worried. She thinks "I WANT TO HELP"**The daggers bounce off its armor plates, and the wall is made of some rather tough stuff, being part of a bunker and all. It would take a while to break through.**The steps seem to be stepping back from where she is running, but it looks like if she turns around that corner she'll be in the same hall as it**She seems very worried with this whole situation, and thinks "I DON'T WANT YOU GOING MISSING TOO!"**Lilith's fears still don't seem to be put to rest, but she seems very intent on keeping the sword safe**It was, but as she rounds the corner the massive bipedal death machine at the other end of the hallway opens fire with a large machine gun*"Ya, it can be a bit intimidating the first time you see it." *A voice calls out from behind her. The voice sounds female, young, and has a slight Spanish accent.* *A girl of obviously Latin descent is stepping out from the bleachers* "Hey, I'm Angel. Sorry about... You know, this whole thing."*The Robot begins to advance towards her as it fires, its massive form clanging loudly against the ground**Afterwords, she realizes that most of her clothes have been reduced to bloody rags and rushes home dreadfully embarrassed and traumatized* *Once they draw close to each other, the robot suddenly stops firing, raises one leg, and kicks forward with it*"Go first? What, we're doing this turn-based like a videogame?" *She says jokingly* "Also, is the, ah..." *She points at Nocturn with one of her swords* "Big guy going to be joining us?"*It is backing into another hallway around a corner**In the first room of the hotel, an old gramophone is playing some old ball music. His opponent is sitting at a table with some tea already brewed* "Took you long enough, kid."*A figure in a simple white robe walks his way up the mountain, those who know enough about the workings of a very particular samurai ritual may recognize this kind of robe.* "Fair enough." *He pours him a cup* "Sugar, cream, what'll you have?" *His voice is a bit gravely, obviously from years of smoking, and also has a light southern drawl to it.**The armor plates don't offer any purchase, her daggers practically blunting against it. Aiming for the plating may not be a good idea.*"Sorry to hear that, Noche." *She says to the dragon**In that case she goes through*"Try Asgard, they like fights.""If you mean "The Most Dangerous Game", then ya. Who were you reading to?" *He says as he puts sugar into the drink and hands it over**The slash makes a cut, but not a deep one. It still destabilizes it a bit. It tries to aim its machine gun at her and fire again**When he reaches the peak, he kneels near the entrance and takes out a small bento box with a light meal of rice*"Why not? Not like I'm gonna hunt them down or anything. The fight's between you and me. They getting better?"*She knocks it away and destabilizes the metallic monster again, but a large barrel suddenly pops out of a hatch along the bottom of the machine, firing a tear gas canister at her*"It's all you can do sometimes. Why're you fighting in this tournament, if you don't mind me asking?"*The machine attempts a clumsy kick with its damaged leg in the middle of the gas cloud*"Mhm. What's her name?"*He is sent a fair distance back, landing in a pile of trash. He coughs as he stands, saying* "You're stronger than you look. Meta? Or am  I just way more shitty than I remember being?"~~meanwhile Hati cries somewhere~~

*He nods* "Funnily enough, I'm here for a girl too."*That most certainly does, the leg seems to be out of commission. The robot swivels its main gun towards her, and it starts to make the ominous whirring again* "I don't like it either, kid." *He sips his tea and shudders* "Always hated this stuff."*It falls to its "knees" while the gun swivels around towards her, firing just a bit early and sending a powerful blast right past her*"Well, you ready?" *He checks his watch* "Looks like it's 'bout ten minutes till Noon. We'll start then." *He stands up, stretches, and begins to walk into the hotel, up the stairs* *It works, and with a sharp whine the servos give out. The teargas launcher turns towards her seemingly in panic, firing off its remaining three shots*thank you! also, yes, but after posting this I realized that someone else asked for the Thursday ones so feel free to give those to them instead. "Well, haven't you ever heard that saying about assumptions?" *He says, holding his hands together and making another ball of light**The cloud begins filling the area as the machine tries to limp away on its barely functioning legs. The machine gun swivels towards her, opening fire into the cloud**10 minutes pass as they find their starting spots, what does Joseph do in this time?*okay!*Well, there's no power cells, but there is what looks like an ammo rack for a rusted-over rocket launcher**One needle, two needles, aaaand BOOM. The force of the blast shakes the ground, and fills the air with more rubble and smoke**The smoke and dust begins to clear a bit, and a flickering red light can be seen**It doesn't seem to be moving. As the dust clears more, it's clear that a fair bit of it is essentially rubble at this point**Its only remaining motor turns slowly, trying to drag it away. Other than that, it does not seem to be capable of anything really**He finishes quickly, placing his meal down and taking a small drink of sake. He then places a small envelope made of old parchment on the ground, and stands to face her. He gives a simple nod of recognition before drawing a sizable Odachi* "Another world."*She could look for that, but it doesn't seem to be capable of fighting back. The intercom system for the bunker suddenly crackles to life, and a voice says* "CONGRRRRRATULATIONS! Carrisa Chadwick, you have just completed the first round of the Lion's Tournament, and are one step closer to rewards beyond your wildest dreams! Transportation off of the island will be ready when you are." *The speakers shut off*[what idea?][well, they could try, but it doesn't. also, the event here isn't quite over and what happens next might make her change her mind.]*As she walks away from the machine, a slightly garbled mechanical voice emanates from it, saying just two words-* "I'M SCARED"*Most of them are hidden, but she gets the ones she sees. The voice is monotone, mechanical, but it continues to speak* "WILL IT HURT?""Eep!" *She seems surprised, and says something in Japanese before stopping herself and speaking in (heavily accented) English* "N-no, it's fine...""WILL I DREAM?"*She may have apparently forgoten that he's wearing a helmet, and thus can't catch dirt in his eyes. As she whips around to attack after throwing the dirt, he pulls a weighted chain out of the ball of light, whipping it at her. The chain glows with a warm- and holy- power.**It is quiet for a while, then says* "I WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN. THE SUN. THE SKY. I AM SORRY."*The last sparking and wiring from inside the bubble of metal begin to slow down, and its voice continues to distort, as it recites to itself "Goodnight Moon"*[you can feel free to have the brain be salvaged, I really like that idea! it would need a character post in whatever new body form it takes though, even if it just becomes a computer program. I could be in charge if you want, but otherwise its personality and knowledge is fairly simple. It has a massive amount of military and strategic knowledge, how different weapons work and the like, and knows a few children's stories and about some animals. Its personality is mostly still in the making, it is very inexperienced in life. It was made by a Russian scientist as a sentient superweapon, but after the scientist's son died he treated it more like a person, leading to it eventually desiring to just live a life as something more than a weapon. This led to the scientist having to help him escape to the island, dieing in the process, as the company the man was working for had no need for a 'kind' weapon. Since then it has just stayed on the island, investigating various animals and ruins. K sealed off the only entrances for the bunker big enough for it while it was inside and threatened to tell the company where he was if he didn't fight.]"Really...? Okay..." *She shifts a bit uncomfortably, unconsciously pulling her hood a bit lower*[that would be okay! that would still need a character approval, though, and for someone to go to the island and salvage him][oh! oops, i forgot that!]

"Sure..."[Akki Ayumu](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3f9juj/akki_ayumu/), number 33!

/u/pineapple_lumps  [I think the second one works! it won't be much of a mission really, K intends to just let it sit there and rust.][the island is abandoned, it has been for years. Nobody's likely to come here.]"A-alright..." *She goes to do so*[just remember, the new A11-V3 will need a character post][well, that depends on who wants to control it.][alright, if you say so! you could also have another user control him if any of them would like to, so think of asking some people. Barring that though, I can make him.][just message me when you decide!]*A nearby belltower rings out twelve times, signifying the beginning of the match**She watches, fairly interested**Such as?**A red dot shows up on his chest**A figure a few floors up in the construction site, using some girders for cover. They're a bit hard to see in the dark. They also will probably fire soon, so he may want to move.**They let loose a few shots, the bullets seem to glow bright white like tracer rounds*[okay!]

*He moves to the side, catching the kick on the shoulder and falling to one knee. He grips the chain with both hands and spins it at her again*"Oh! I have not seen that before."*Alright. Most of the hallways have windows, but none of them are angled in a way that gives a straight shot to another window**The wound burns, as if it was on fire. In fact, it seems to be on fire- with a smoldering white flame. The wound also doesn't seem to be healing**There's a fire escape enclosed starwell at the other end of one of the windowed halls, from out of the windows he can see the crumbling abandoned parking lot, the only meaningful feature being a large flagpole* "Are y-you in the building yet?" *Down the hall is a light shifting noise, like a chair moving* *She nods*"H-hello...?" *He's right outside of the door to the room where the shifting noise came from**There's no response, but there are a few very quiet footsteps from above**Whoever is above seems to have been tossed by the blast, but he can hear them getting back up* *They were far enough away to not be hit by that one, judging by the lack of noise from above* *The person open fires with an assault rifle of some kind as they back up a ramp to the next floor**It doesn't seem to have any thermal energy, it's not normal fire. His opponent has made their way up to the next level**Nope. But he hears the noise again, something is definitely in there* "Oh! Good work!"*Whoever is up there is running to a new position*[I mean a closed-off stairwell kind of fire escape by the way, not the old-fashioned external ones]

*As he walks down the hall, a click can be heard from the floor above him, followed by the sound of a pistol going off, ricocheting off the flagpole outside, and finally striking the wall, missing him by barely an inch*"T-T-Tim, you there? I'm startin to kind of freak out man!" *The room looks empty, just a chair and a desk in an abandoned office, but a mental image suddenly appears in Tim's head, as if broadcast there- Being strapped to a table, someone cutting into his chest with a scalpel* *She blushes a bit, but it's hard to see with her face already being a redish color. She hands over the salt**He could try this, but there's dozens of beams made of steel, this could take a while**A voice calls down from a few floors above, reaching him through  the open window* "Kid, I missed on purpose. I don't wanna hurt you. Just give it up now.""Tim! Can! You! Hear! Me!" *More noises come from the room, a fair bit louder this time**Well, there's no response. Also, there's multiple floors, so I'll warn you ahead of time that this might not be a very effective plan.**He damages two of the supports and a patch of the floor comes crumbling in**As the door opens, the chair flies at him at high speed*[okay! Micheal's meant to lose unless you greatly mess up anyway, so it'll probably be fine]

*A slow, plodding set of footsteps can be heard approaching from the distance. The gait is uneven.* "Kid, I'm not sure I even want to know what that means**The chair breaks on the shield, and Vince speaks* "Oh! What was that noise?"[keep in mind, his special rule is a time limit.]*The figure pokes out from the ramp to the floor bellow and fires, aiming for his wings**Well, he'd need to go up that stairwell for that.*"I HEARD something Tim!" *More of the rooms start to produce noises* *Her other hand brings up a spas-12 shotgun, and once he gets close she lets loose a buckshot blast coated in holy fire* *The second he opens the door to the stairwell, two gunshots ring out, ricocheting off of the metal handrails all the way down and aiming for his left arm*"Then you could just visit. Alternatively, some artists and inventors have made False suns."*Where?*"Some of them. Not everyone wants a yellow sun.""Th-thank you."*He grabs it and manages to pull it from her grasp as she runs back down into the building**The glowing white fires don't seem to be burning him, but they are stopping his regeneration* *She fires the last few rounds from her assault rifle, then tosses it to the side, pulling a large desert eagle out from its holster. For the first time he can get a good look at her, she looks adamant, but more than slightly terrified* "Blue looks nice.""I didn't hear a scream or a squish." *Says the voice from a few levels up* "Which means I'm guessing you're wearing armor. Gotta be pretty good too, because you didn't even stumble."*It looks like a normal modern hospital, just abandoned.* *She dives to the side, but some of the rubble slams onto her foot, breaking her ankle. She screams a bit and tries to limp away from the rubble pile. gathering a ball of white light in her hand**She is currently applying the light to her wounded ankle, stitching the bones together just enough to be able to walk*"Sure thing, a man's work is a man's pride, it's good to give it a name."*In the hall things begin to get rather crazy, debris and items begin flying around at high speed**It was a few feet to her side, sending her flying back and winded again.**He isn't nearby, but through the radio he can hear running water now, it sounds like a shower. That means he's likely in one of the shower rooms. The map says there's one in each of the three main wings, so does he go north, east, or west?**It stabs right into her abdomen, eliciting a scream of pain. One of her hands grabs a large knife from her belt, swinging it at the blade**She does, but the weighted chain remains tangled around her leg. He lands on all fours, stumbling to stand up, and inadvertently tugs the chain as he tries to get his balance back* *This way seems even more chaotic, objects are flying about at almost blinding speeds. Vince seems to be hyperventilating and asking Tim to answer him*

[how tough is the forcefield?]*She tries to swing at him, but he successfully kicks it away. She holds a hand over her wound, however- and if he can feel the virus, he would feel that all traces of the virus in her system are rapidly being destroyed*[the fight dossier says everyones' stats]

*Danger level 5**The sounds of the man walking away can be heard* "Nice name, kid.""Yes please."[okay! just checking]

*The hallways is violently active with thrown objects, but suddenly Vince begins to count.**Her other hand grabs her pistol again, firing a few whopping .50 caliber rounds at him**No more bullets get in the way as he makes his way to the top, and the man says* "All the best ones do, kid.""Hm?" *He says as he stands again* "Coming from the girl who tries biting and throwing dirt in people's faces?"*The numbers don't seem to mean anything, until Vince gets to 7- If Tim has memorized the map by now, he's in hall 7. When Vince reaches 7, the items all suddenly drop. The place is eerily quiet before Vince starts giggling through the earpiece* *The source of the footsteps is soon seen, a hulking twisted figure. He is dragging a large jagged axe behind him*"Thank you... My name..." *She seems to think for a bit, trying to remember how to say something* "My name Akki, you?"*She had managed to destroy some of the biomass in her body, but there was enough left to leave a fair-sized hole. She looked at it in shock, applied some light to it to stop the bleeding, and then promptly passed out* [While... that is not really *against the rules*, i would kind of prefer if Thorn didn't end the fight in ten seconds. Plus K would probably be very bemused with such a short fight]*As he does so, an intercom system springs to life, letting out a pre-recorded message* "CONGRRRRRATULATIONS! Curtis Crane, you have just completed the first round of the Grand Lion's Tournament, and are one step closer to rewards beyond your wildest dreams! You may leave the site at your leisure." *It seems also that, now that the girl has passed out, the white fire is no longer stopping his regeneration**She does so, but the chain is still holy. He is surprised by this, and gags at the chain now choking him, but rather then grab it he lets go and holds his hands together again, forming another ball of light*[he's not exactly fast. He probably could have caught it if it wasn't for Thorn holding onto the thing instead of throwing it]*The man is at the other end of the hall, his back turned**He is capable of regrowing as usual again. The girl is probably bleeding quite a bit*[okay! you don't really have to, but be warned OOC that if she ends a fight that fast she'll probably be punished for making the fight 'boring' to K]*Her eyes barely flutter open**He falls forward, but catches himself with one hand- the other one now holding a [jitte](http://www.budoya.es/images/large/utiles/jitte5_LRG.jpg) glowing with holy energy. The chain, on the other hand, seems to disappear.* "g-go demon!" *She half-heartedly swings her fist at him*"Why would a monster care?" *She tries to heal her wounds, but her light seems dimmer than before, and slower*"It is nice to meet you...""Hey, kid. You ready?"*She cringes at it, but her light actually seems to grow brighter by a bit* "No...""Draw on three." *He says with a somber smile, placing his revolver in its holster**He, surprisingly, catches the plow. He then uses it to knock the cabin away**She seems unsure what to say, so she eats instead**He whips around, aiming to slam the jitte into the side of her leg*"Two." *He seems perfectly calm*"All you need is to burn, like all monsters." *Her light grows a fair bit brighter, and her wounds are healing at an amazing rate*"Fooooooound yoooooooou" *The voice says, before all objects nearby jerk into the air again. They fly to the other end of the hall, forming a thick wall of sorts, and then begin to slide towards him at high speed**He holds the plow down in front of him, pushing it forward as a shield as he approaches*"DRAW" *He whips his gun out almost too fast to see, but rather than turn around he fires four shots at the metal candlestick at the end of the wall in front of him, sending them ricocheting back through the hall, aimed at Joseph's limbs.**She falls, landing a few stories below on a pile of rubble**Yes*[sure! I'm not overly picky, but how about Trish?]*He gives a sickening grin as he walks closer. Any of the seeds that end up too close to him shrivel and die in the ground**Skipping to epilogue thing?**She seems rather interested in this, and her stomach rumbles* *The man turns around just in time to see it, taking the fireball to his left arm. He begins panicking a bit and trying to stamp it out*"I don't know, you didn't look particularly poor when you blushed blue."*Her kick grazes him, ripping apart part of his jacket with the force of it**It makes a hole in it big enough for most of his upper body, but his lower body will probably still be hit by the lower part of the wall**Afterwords, the girl is found there, miraculously alive. She spent a week in the hospital before going to return to her church. As she approached the door, she heard from inside a distinctive hellish moan, the kind only one kind of creature makes. She took a deep breath, fought back a tear or two, and opened the door with a pistol in her hand.* 

*end**He manages to get away from that one mostly, only getting his shoe on fire. He drops to the ground to stop drop and roll**She sheepishly nods*[wanna know what happened?]*He seems fairly fine, despite the damaged jacket* "Seriously? This thing's expensive. Well, it isn't actually to be honest."*He looks up, rather surprised, as the rocks come down to crush him. An unsettling color of green goo leaks out from under the rocks afterwords**Luckily, her managed to get the fires about before that, and he says* "Hold up, time out for a second. I'm not as young as I used to be."[okay! done!][uh...?]"I'm not, I'm not sure why you're so convinced I'm a thief."*There's not enough time, this wall is moving pretty fast**He gets back up, stretching. A crack can be heard as he stretches his back, which he grumbles at. After a few seconds, he turns back to him* "Alright, on three."[K had stolen her teacher's corpse, and was threatening to raise it as an undead. Since she fought well he just raised it as a zombie instead of something worse.]"By the standards of some human, dwarven, asgardian, alfheimian, and various other worlds' standards, yes."*He manages it, but only barely*[so, she had to go put him down.][she's still sad about it. Also he probably ate at least one person, so she needs to go stop a zombie outbreak][a hitch...?]*The earbud is now full of screaming, and he suddenly gets several more flashes in his mind of gory and terrifying scenes.*[it's just a small one luckily though]"Why am I a creep? Swear to god, try to return a wallet these days and you get mugged, what's the city coming to?"[Preacher..?]*Vince is just kind of gibbering. When he finally enters the shower Vince is curled up under one of them, but they are all on. He shouts* "TIIIIIIIM"[okay!]"ACK!" *The bullet stops in mid air, and the gun suddenly flies apart into several pieces. Vince scrambles to his feet and starts running at him* "I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE!"[most likely!]ooooooh. should I go back and try to decipher the thingy now...?&gt;and the gun suddenly flies apart into several pieces

[Vince kind of just telekinetically took the gun apart.]"You like wandering the middle of the night though."[okay!]

"I will try..." *She starts peeling the potatoes* "My standards..?"[it's okay!]

"ACK!" *He catches one to the side and immediately falls, it doesn't take much to put him down it seems*"Really? Huh, looks like vamps lie sometimes. I met one who told me the whole sunlight thing was basically not True.""P-p-please stop Tim! Oh god oh god I'm bleeding!"[alright! when, where, IC or OOC, and what's the situation?]"I-I don't wanna go back!" *The other gun similarly comes apart, and the bullet in Vince's side suddenly flies back out and towards Tim's stomach* "Listen, I really don't wanna fight. I don't really even know why you attacked me. Can we talk this out?" *A PA system in the quarry turns on and says* "CONGRRRRRATULATIONS! Thorn, you have just completed the first round of the Lion's Tournament, and are one step closer to rewards beyond your wildest dreams! You may leave when you feel ready." *The speakers shut off*[okay! any particular reason for them fighting or just fighting?][can he react to bullets?]"Well... For a human, yes."[i was refering to his reaction speed. the bullet flew out of him at almost the same speed it flew into him]*He sighs, holding his hands together again* "So, out of curiosity, how much holy energy can you take?""You are blushing again""Well, I really hope I don't hurt you much." *Another Jitte forms in his other hand, also glowing with holy power**Vince is frozen solid*[easy! Danica is part of ULTRA, Trish is a less-than-moral meta who might be mistaken for a criminal in the process of beating the heck out of people trying to mug her] [okay!]

*Trish is currently kicking someone after already beating them senseless as punishment for trying to mug her. She has her guitar case on her back**He instead takes a step back, dropping both of the weapons in front of him. Under his breath he's counting* *She rolls her eyes and turns around* "Fuckin' seriously? Where were you a minute ago when I was about to get mugged, buying some doughnuts?" "That easily?""Jesus can you just let me off with a warning? I'm tired as shit tonight." *The hospital intercom sparks to life* "CONGRRRRRATULATIONS! Tim Marcoh, you have just completed the first round of the Lion's Tournament, and are one step closer to rewards beyond your wildest dreams! You may leave when you feel ready." *The speakers shut off*[end?][it's okay!]

"You likely do not, but believe what you will."*It seems to be a large circular barge of some kind, almost the length of a football field. It's stacked with various weights, scrap metal, and melee weapons. In the middle of it, an 8 foot tall mountain of a man is eating what one can only assume from the size is a fried Giraffe leg.**He makes the first strike, springing forward with rather surprising speed for a human and swinging his blade towards her neck*"Not at the moment."[I actually don't know how your powers work well enough to know that. I kind of assumed instant freezing meant pretty dead]*Lilith stands by dutifully. She seems very intent on not messing this up.*IC: *Lilith thinks for a while, then writes ADVENTURE TIME, IT LOOKS FUN*

OOC: probably pokemon! I would love to have an eevee or an arcanine or a cubone! "Really? Odd." *He seems generally disinterested and sarcastically says* "Oh yes, I'm sure you could regale us with stories about how privileged and foolish the younger generation is." *While focusing on something on his visor*"Why? Makeup is common in human society.""Oh, so you're a rebellious anarchist." *He says with thicker sarcasm* "Ya, that's why I'm tired now."[that's not really how freezing a person works...]"Ya, no. I'm out." *She turns to go*"Sure." *He sounds completely disinterested. Looks like he's playing pong on his visor*"How many worlds? Countless.""Are you sure about that?" *His visor flicks through pictures of goths in heavy makeup*[is it like, ice freezing? or petrification/time freezing?]*She hears this, growling in annoyance and whipping back around as she swings the guitar case in front of her* "Can you not?"*He shrugs* "Suit yourself."*As she goes over the two weapons, one of them suddenly explodes in a blast of holy energy**She looks decidedly unimpressed* "Seriously? I wasn't even trying to hit you that time." *She holds her case towards herself, popping it open*"Cute..?"[the what...? is that another name for the containment foam?]"Sure I do." *He says sarcastically, already on over 300 points and the padals beginning to move to fast for the eye to see*  "Also, don't touch that. It's sensitive equipment."[alright? well in that case he's just frozen and shot]*He picks up the other holy jitte and cautiously walks over to her* "You alright?""You sure about that kid?"[oooooh okay!]

*Well, Trish does still have the open guitar case in front of her so I'm not sure that works very well. She does take a sheathed blade out of the guitar case though*"I'm serious, I don't want to hurt you." *He gets closer, summoning a holy staff and poking her foot with it*"Jesus what is that stuff? It feels like I just sniffed a habanero." *She drops the case, holding her sword sheath* "Also, not sure if you noticed, but you have fists, I have a sword."*He sighs, and summons a small dagger to his hand, nicking one of his fingers* "Even if you're a mugging vampire, I don't kill people." *He walks over to hold the dripping blood over her mouth*[okaaaay]

*Later, Vince 'thaws', gasping for breath*"Mhm. Nice to see you finally showed up, kid." *He says in a deep, somewhat mocking voice.* "Now land, so that stupid timer'll start.""I am not cute. I am Brokkr, greatest craftsman of the dwarves.""The name's Max. Max Breaker. What do they call you?" *As he lands, the barge shifts, it seems to be moving now**He responds with a jitte across the face**Vince scrambles back in fear*"Nah, it's great to meet someone you get to fight!""That is... Better." *His cheeks look a bit darker than usual*"I dunno about you, but I don't have many 'stipulations'."*He laughs* "Oh ya, I forgot the rest of you needed that crap."*He sighs, kneels down next to her, and says* "You can have blood as long as you don't try to turn me into a vampire and you don't try to kill me. I don't want anyone to die tonight." *He offers his cut finger to her*"G-get back Tim! I don't wanna have to hurt you!""Dammit dammit DAMMIT I'm gonna have to go back..." *Some more of the mental images flash in his head**He sighs, dips a few more drops of blood near her mouth to make sure she's probably not faking it again, and then goes to slip the wallet into her mailbox*"Am I?"*He sighs* "Just please don't try anything, I really don't like hitting girls." *He comes back, scooping her up and carrying her bridal-style**He looks at himself and sniffs* "Oil, isn't it?"*The golden metal comprising his armor seems to melt a bit, and shifts upward to make a protective helmet over his face and visor*"Oh my, you've actually developed an ego you need to protect.""So, which one is your apartment?""Odd.." *His cheeks get a bit darker**He looks at his gun* "So, you've got one of those powers?"[would you say that by this point he knows her address as Simon or no?]"Nothin to be sorry about kid." *He puts his guns down* "And no point fightin. A man's gotta know when he's beat. I can't fire that darn thing without lighting up like a matchstick.""You sure? Also, I know. I called him Noche, it's spanish for basically the same thing.""I don't think I've blushed in a while."[alright, just checking]

"What's your name anyway, if you don't mind me asking?""Laughing at technology working as intended is not humor, it is a pitiful attempt to boost a weak ego.""Illya...? Wait, but you don't look anything like the picture. Also, it's in my pocket.""I didn't want to snoop, so I didn't see the other one.""Yes, thank you.""Oh! Real things for once!" *She tries solidifying* "I don't really know midgardian beverages well. Surprise me.""I'll have to put you down to do it, you okay with that?""Well, we do drink alcohol but it's not the only thing we drink. Also, most of us can handle our alcohol rather well.""I meant if you're alright with me putting you down, like will it hurt your wounds more.""Alright, let's try Midgardian alcohol."*He returns a somewhat more somber smile before jumping back, pushing off of the kanobo with his incredible strength to send himself further*"Vaguely, I don't study Midgard much.""Hm... Kinda spooky." *She begins looking around, preferably for anything that looks valuable* *Lilith bounds up to him one day, looking very worried. She's also carrying Raven's sword for some reason**She holds up a note I'M WORRIED ABOUT KATIE**He chuckles, he might have actually got that reference* "Well, looks like you won, kid." *Some speakers in the building suddenly crackle to life* "CONGRRRRRATULATIONS! Joseph Cortez, you have just completed the first round of the Lion's Tournament, and are one step closer to rewards beyond your wildest dreams! You may leave when you so choose." *The speakers shut off**He, rather gently, outs her down, then takes out the wallet to look at the pictures**She writes another message, YOU'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE AND YOU'RE KATIE'S FRIEND TOO AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO**Laine sighs, and takes some bandages and tweezers out of his jacket to fix up Joseph's wounds.**The Samurai rushes forward to meet her charge rather recklessly* "Well, looks like I was wrong. Sorry about that."*Even with her mask on she's obviously still worried. She writes I HOPE SHE'S BACK SOON...*"As many said of some of the other "Nine realms". Humans truly do love dead things, don't they? It's a bit disturbing.""Ack! Go away spooky golem! Or say something I understand, like Latin or something!"*Sure. Epilogue-*

*That night, as Laine makes his way back to his home after having cleaned his clothes as well as he could, he sees a package on the doorstep of his home, opened. The side is emblazoned with a large letter K.* "Oooh boy." *He walks up to the door, attempting to be quiet. Before he can touch it, it is pulled open from inside. On the other side is a woman, she's old but it's still obvious that she was once very beautiful- and to Laine, she still is very beautiful. What's not beautiful, on the other hand, is the contents of the pictures and documents in her hands. She gives him a stern glare, and says* "Talk. Now." 

*End**She looks surprised and writes DATE?**His movements show skill, but little regard for his own safety. He is putting power behind his attacks, but leaving himself open to counterattacks.**She looks very surprised HOW COME NOBODY TOLD ME?*"FLEEEEE!" *She scrambles to the side, and tries to vomit acid at the thing**She looks sad, and writes BUT WE'RE BESTIES...**That seems to have made her sadder* *He smiles under his mask and picks her back up* "Alright. Sure you don't need any more blood?""Spirits. Humans like to attribute everything to spirits, ghosts, and demons. They just seem to like dead things."*She solemnly writes BUT WE COULD HAVE STAYED UP LATE AND TALKED ABOUT BOYS...*"ACK!" *She flies up, and tries to land on top of it* "Stupid big gollem thingy!""I figure I kind of owe you some after almost frying you to death."*His speed is incredible, when she punches past the holes in his defense he often dodges away quick enough to barely get clipped- but those small clips are adding up on the unarmored warrior. He is putting enough power into his strikes now that the ground beneath him is cracking* "Isn't it the same thing?"*She flops over facedown onto the deck of the ship, making a rather large BANG as she collides with the metal. She then does a deep sigh.*"Depends on the culture.""Tell me, exactly how many advanced pieces of technology do you know that are made to have idiots poke them with sticks?""Damn your infinite wisdom!" *She flies behind it and, in a bit of a panic, tries just hitting it*"Well, the more you know."*She sighs harder and writes I CAN'T HELP BECAUSE I CAN'T LEAVE THE SHIP*"Blood, not to sound mean but I can't be going on dates at the moment.""It was an insult, imbecile." *She writes BUT I'M GREAT AT FINDING PEOPLE!**She manages to do so, but the man responds by drawing a tanto at almost lightning fast speed with his other hand, and slashing at her stomach* please remember to put your flair!*She sits back up and points to her nose*no problem!*She nods and writes I AM VERY GOOD AT SMELLING! HEARING AND SEEING TOO!**He plays back a recording of the earlier "stick protection device" line* *She looks sad, and flops back over**He sighs* "Can I put you down first? It'll be a bit hard from this angle"*She writes WHAT IF THERE'S DANGER? I CAN HELP WITH THAT**PLEASE BE CAREFUL...* "Alright." *He walks to the apartment* "You wanna open the door? I don't have a key.""Alright." *He goes in and lays her on the nearest soft surface, probably a couch**He rolls his eyes and begins playing rather loud dwarven folk music*"Sorry, but the helmet doesn't come off. That part was True." *He sits down next to her*"Why?" *He says, rolling up his sleeve* "Also, this won't turn me into a vamp or anything, right?""Alright. You feeling alright?" *He says, holding out his arm*"Don't worry about it, I'll be fine. Surprisingly you tend to lose a lot of blood working as a superhero, you start to get used to it." *He says with a joking tone**No response*"As I'll ever be."*He's still paying attention to his visor*"Medium." *Trish looks bemused, but draws her sword, it glows a light blue* "I really don't wanna hurt you since you're just doing your job. Just stand down."okay! i am not a mod, but a few notes!

1: concrete times on things! things like "how long does it take for things to wear off" and "how long does it take to go from boost to mutation", anything which has a concrete time to it needs to have that time stated

2: What things do and do not count as having "lifeforce"? undead? spirits? sentient machines? living parasitic magic artifacts? just think of a couple that probably do not.

3: How fast do things hit by his life force heal? 

4: How does he hit people with the lifeforce, an aura/area kind of thing, a projectile, or contact?

5: Is knowing about the protectiveness inducement the only way to stop it?

6: as for the backstory, it should be fine but be warned that you will most definitely need to talk to the mods if anything related to his backstory shows up again! also be warned that there's at least a 89% chance that at least one person on the sub will get bored and try to use this backstory to end the world. *Stomach rumbling, and while paying attention to the smell accidentally crushing a potato in her hand and then hurryingly trying to hide it**The armor shifts again as he kicks, forming a mildly spiky shield in the way*[I said that she is *not* pouring out alcohol anymore. She used to pour most of it out when she made dinner]*She hides it behind her back and says something in Japanese**She begins looking around for somewhere to hide the smashed potato**She scoots backwards to it*[okay!]"Sure.""N-nothing!" *She drops the potato behind her into the trash*"Th-thanks... I peeled the potatoes ^^mostly ""O-oh! okay!" *She does so*"Really?""Why?"[[you forgot to tag and we lost 4 more days...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk_QyPykxZA)]"Um... The stove...?""Odd, I didn't realize humans held that stereotype of us."*She just looks confused*"Th-thanks..." *She sheepishly starts eating*

[did you intend for Akki to have a suggestion there...?]*Well Trish is sent flying back, looking pretty surprised. She lands at the other end of the alley, and stands up, coughing* "Didn't feel like warning me you were a meta? Well, that's damn sporting of you." *She says sarcastically* "Well, since we're all being honest-" *Her sword bursts into blue flames* "Once, I found it rather offensive."[she has no fire powers, she just looks like a demon, she isn't really one...]

"N-no..."*Lilith would probably be very happy to hear that if Katja was on the ship at the moment for her to hear*"In which all dwarves are violent greedy incompetent drunks." "S-sorry!""Th-thank you...""No thanks." *She makes several high-speed slashes with her sword, sending out blasts at Danica. Danica likely doesn't know this, but the blasts are of the non-lethal kind*"I don't feel like having anyone say the entirety of my people have a total of twelve braincells between us. Plus, battle is more of Asgard's obsession, not Nidavellir's." "I... Seem to have the powers of an Oni... But mostly I'm just really heavy and strong and tough...""It's not always good..."[she doesn't actually have high enough durability for that. even if she's in her vest, that's a *vest*, it by definition wouldn't cover her arms]"We have the same variety as humans do in most respects.""BACK THERE!" *More of the images flash in his mind, medical experiments bordering on downright torture*"Can't stay here... Not safe now..."*He nods, stands, and starts sprinting out*"Whenever you are, chica bonita." *She stands in a battle-ready stance*[end?][okay!]

*Epilogue*

*As the bleeding man leaves the hospital, he calms down. Being in that place wasn't good for him, but now he was starting to be rational again. He could figure this out, he thought as he walked home. He just had to-... His thoughts stopped suddenly as he saw it- a large unmarked van outside of his apartment.*

*end*[did you drop this?]*Lilith writes a message that says NOT REALLY*

/u/Trevosutto [can she punch energy? if not, I don't see how she is punching the blasts away, and if she's not punching them away or something then her durability score (4) isn't high enough to block it]*She huffs, is quiet for a bit, then remembers something and writes OH YA AND RAVEN IS LOOKING FOR HER TOO*turtles! i like turtles!"Well... Thanks? I think? I'm not sure how to respond to that. You finished?"[doesn't that make her durability against any attack she sees coming an 8 then? also, her chart says she only has powers on one of her arms, in which case she can't superpunch *and* block at the same time, since only her left arm does power things according to her page]*She nods, and writes SHE TOLD ME TO TAKE CARE OF HER SWORD, waving the thing in the air to show him*"Alright, sleep tight, vamp." *He rolls his sleeve back down and gets up to go**She nods, holding it more carefully*[if she assumed she was going to get cut then why did she do a blast thing to block it...? this isn't making much sense..]"Do I look like a thief? Don't answer that." *He walks out, locking the door behind him*[you said that she blocked and *then* blasted the ground][i understand how her blast worked, I am just still trying to figure out what in her powers allowed her to block Trish's sword blasts]*Lilith is probably flattered by this*"Well, I can't swim anymore...""Well, as I was about to say, they are not the most pleasant of neighbors." "EEP!" *She dives to the ground, it barely misses her*"They spend most of their time lazing about, mooching off of the Dwarves, stealing from us, or selling things we made." "Many humans have told me this." "Eh heh heh..." *She gives a bit of an awkward laugh as she stands back up* "Oh... Would you look at the time!" *She bolts into the air, taking off and away from the thing at high speed* "Well, whether humanity agrees or not does not undo all the crimes perpetrated by the Dark Elves." "God, how many of these things are there?" *She lands on a high roof to rest a bit* "Well, we haven't raided their planet and stolen their hard-made technological progresses, no." "Eep!" *She did not expect that*"Um... Customer service told me to call here about getting a hoverboard that can carry more.." "Darn!" *She flaps her wings, taking off into the air, but this time diving towards one's head with her claws forward* "Fair enough." *He tries his tea* "Ouch! Why is midgardian food too hot all the time?" "Okay. My tongue has been burned far too many times on this world..." [i'm actually pretty sure it doesn't have the stats for that]"*Someone* ruined my success at the last moment, as the artifact was literally within arm's reach. A certain someone named after a mythological figure also known for causing too much trouble. Also, that numbskull Yves tried to destroy the artifact as soon as he saw it." *He sips the drink* "Sweet. Both the drink and the comment. But why did you call me honey?" "Humans call each other after a product made from insect saliva as a term of endearment?" [from the fact that her claws are a danger 6, and a really doubt that its medieval shield can block that][okaaay!]"Um... about ^one ^thousand ^^kilograms..."*Well, she still has momentum so the claws with shield are still going right at it's head**She lifts off, their spears making small cuts in her legs' natural armor as she narrowly escapes, She whips the remains of the shield at one of the skeletons*"So is antifreeze.""I'm not entirely sure either, but I *do* know that that maze we went through had plenty of tricks like that.""Fair point.""I am fine with it, I just find it odd that humans consider honey in particular to be endearing.""U-um I think so... How much would it cost?""That works.""They don't have princes. Not the Dark Elves at least."[we actually haven't decided OOC how the other elves work yet...]

"It's complicated""Why?"*She takes off, roosting on a nearby rooftop for a moment to catch her breath* "They have varied tastes just like humans do." "Again, I don't mind it." "Like I said, they vary. Some may like it some won't." *He shrugs and drinks his soup, immediately burning his tongue again* *She sighs and flops over* "What am I even doing? I'm a schoolgirl, not some superhero.""No, we eat things prepared to the perfect temperature, never too hot nor too cold." "For some..." *She takes a bit of a breather, and then looks down over the edge, looking to see if anyone's in danger**Well, she's glad that at least some people made it out alive. She starts flying over the city, using her amazing vision to locate any officers in need of assistance.* *He takes another spoon of soup, gingerly blowing on it before drinking it with a bit of a wince* "It does taste good though..." "Well, you made a good choice. Other than the heat." *She dives, aiming her talons to pick the man up by the shoulders* "Thank you." *He sips on the iced tea, looking slightly happy for once* "Hm? Sorry about that. Would you like to ask more about my world?""Woah! Hold still, I'm trying to save your life!""Sorry to hear that... If it's any consolation, I am having a rather pleasant time." "No, I am finding your discussions of human culture to be interesting." "Jeez...." *She grumbles a bit, but starts flying them back towards the nearest group of officers* "Um... How much is that...?" [minor note, but you forgot Akki on the list of operatives! also, she would probably volunteer to try the training mission][IIRC I signed up for number 33]"Relax...?" "No, this is just how I usually am." "Sorry, did I say that oddly...?" *He looks slightly worried that he's made a social faux pas* "I didn't take it as an insult." "Really? Well, this is my first 'date' too, so don't feel too apprehensive." "It was a weird crystal maze thing, plenty of things tried to kill us and it made us screw each other over at some points. Pardon my language but it wasn't a pleasant experience." "Indeed." *He gets a small smile*[want to continue...?][okay!]"And cut the capricious shtick." "That wasn't snark." "You're blushing again, by the way." "Good. Now, you want to go over things you need to practice?" "Okay..?" *He looks confused, but looks down to the remains of his soup* "25 million?! Th-thanks anyway... I'll just wait..." "Well, Boogeyman was nearly killed. I'm currently the only reason he survived." "Not in my opinion. Blue is a good color." "N-no, it's okay!" *She is feeling embarrassed even over the phone* *She drops him off with the other officers and then lands, she looks pretty tired* "Thanks... You should keep looking for anyone else who needs help though." "No? Do all humans find exotic and new things disturbing?""Where'd all these things come from anyway?" "I have seen that. What would many humans think of me?" *He looks a bit annoyed at that* "Yes, I still feel generally disgruntled that so many humans feel this way." "But I'm not human." "First one is keeping your cool." my suggestion for getting more general involvement is making more smaller events! since only around 2-4 people get involved in an event at a time often, having many smaller ones would give more people chances to use their powers and do things on the sub. by "smaller events" i mean like the bank robbery one we did recently, tiny "side quests" so to speak. "The person who came with us in my head. It is an odd story." oh, and sorry for not putting this in my first comment, but more open events. things like the sand one and the pumpkin one in that lots of people can join it, but hopefully with more consequences in the future. While I understand why you have NPCs fight the big bad guys while we fight the mooks, it kind of feels like we aren't doing anything important in the end"What about my ears?" *She looks surprised, then sees who did it and smiles under her mask* "Portals..? Creepy..." *She seems happy about this, and picks him up to hug him* "Body modification..? Are pointy ears a popular modification among humans?" *Lilith looks confused, and writes a message saying WON'T THEY BE MORE PREPARED WHEN WE ACTUALLY GO AFTER THEM NOW?* *She huffs a bit and writes THIS KIND OF STUFF SOUNDS LIKE WHAT PEOPLE YELLED AT ME FOR LAST TIME...**She huffs and turns her back* "What about the ones who want to look like dwarves?""Why not?" *He pouts a bit* "Well, what do *you* think of dwarves?" "I see..." *She offers a bowl of the soup to him* "Thank you..." Travis (Trish) was raised by his mother, an assassin known as the Throneless Queen. He's a bit more laid back, but other than that acts and looks mostly the same.

---

Hati and Skoll are weird

---

Beatrice (Bernard) is a massive jolly woman who is most certainly not a bear. 

---

Akira (Akki) is a delinquent gaining the powers of a Blue Oni. His new powers are also making him often become even more reckless than usual.

---

Danny (Dolly) is largely the same, but likes showing off his powers more.

---

Lord Carey Cambell (take a guess) is a bratty age-changing magic user who dresses in animal onesies and suits. Due to being the firstborn son he is somewhat more disciplined. 

---

Brokkr (name is the same really) Is basically the same person other than yelling at people more."So... do you need help...?" *He doesn't take it* "I have seen already. Humans think we are loud drunken hooligans." "Wonderful." *He says sarcastically* "Some are."*She casts a somewhat cold glare at the photographer, but someone experienced enough would likely realize that she is striking a subtle regal pose as she does so. She turns her face forward again as she answers* "Simple. He is a magic being who lived in my head for a short while." "Strange loud tall people." "O-oh! Okay!""Because that is what he calls himself." "Sort of?""When you're in a fight, that's all you can think about. Period." /u/jellysnake , will you be doing your battle or not?TOURNAMENT ARC EVENTS:

Doesn't mean you aren't supposed to do it." "To be honest dwarves tend to have a higher opinion of humans than of dark elves." [it's alright, just please try to get it done]"Practice. It's discipline, not a party trick." "Not usually.""There's not a problem. I said they have higher opinions of you than of the elves." "Blowing smoke rings." "Hm..?"Brokkr showed up and generally was antisocial and awkward*He chuckles* "Probably not." "It's alright." *She is currently handing out big bushels of apples and other fruits to passersby for free*"Hm? Hello!" *She gives her a large smile* "Would you like apples? Apples good!" would Janet 74 still call herself JC? Also, want to have her talk to Travis (Trish)?"For free, silly!" *She says with a booming laugh* "Not to worry!" *She holds out a wicker basket full of apples* "Now, you two have good day!"[end?][okay! you want to start?]"Kid if you lecture me on my pastimes I will personally lock you in a closet until you finish the biggest pack of cigars I can find." *Travis walks in, looking a bit bored. There's a few fleck of blood on his shirt, he probably just fought off some muggers again.*"Alright enough goofing off. Second thing you need to work on in battle is being quiet.""No, then you've already fucked up." "Hm? Oh, sup Jacey." *He takes a seat across from her and sighs*"It was in ours." "Fine, other than dealing with more assholes who somehow haven't heard how easily I can kick their ass. And don't call me kid." "And don't call me baby, you're not old enough to be that desperate. Yet.""Emo? What about me looks emo?""I'm an asshole, not emo, two different things." "Do I *look* goth or emo?" "I'm literally not wearing a single piece of black." "Huh?" *He looks at it* "Shit... That stuff is a bitch to wash out." "I chose to.""So, just keeping it fair. Don't do that in the future." "What? It is." "Now, what kind of weapons do you know how to use?" [I don't know what happened OOC, can you fill me in?] "Got it. You going for nonlethal? And if so, you going for as little damage as possible?" [okaaaaay. Any other specifics I should know?] "Leave the axe at home, it'll weigh you down. What kind of hammer is it?" okay. should I have AV talk to Jason when he calls? "Not what I meant. Shape, weight, striking face size, handle length, I need details." um... I just read the thread... there's a minor problem. Persuasion power only lasts 24 hours IIRC. does that work...? doesn't that kind of make it infinite since she can just keep someone near her? I'm also not really sure how she did the fire, that character in general seems to do a lot of odd things. still, she has other people's approval to do it to their characters. you agreed to this whole thingy too, right? wait, did she agree to the contract thingy before or after being brainwashed? i am not a mod, but... that sounds incredibly iffy ruleswise. If people can agree to her "I control you for x years" contracts while mind controlled by her normally, doesn't that mean anyone who spends the couple minutes required to be controlled by her for a day can instantly become permanent slaves? wait, did she agree to the year contract after the fire and needle thing? if so, she was under persuasion at that point. it is up to you, but you might want to bring that to the mod's attention. your choice, of course. so... your thoughts...?well, you also might want to just talk to Ms.Rin about it first. It would be rude to leave her out of the discussion. "I can go now, thanks..." okaaaay! feel free to message/tag me if you need me for any reason
"That'd work." "Yes. Some people like the practice." *She takes off, looking for someone to help again**He shrugs* "I think I'm a bit young to think about marriage already." "I don't really like big parties." "The main attraction..?" [I don't actually know what it looks like OOC][want to have Juniper talk to Travis (Trish)?]okaaaay"Criticizing me for it doesn't make it less True." "Oh. I haven't really ever had a party in my honor." [okay!]

*Travis walks to the church, he didn't have much to do today and his mother was away as usual* "Yo, June, you here?" "I've had those, but they weren't really... 'parties'. Not enough people." "What, you think I got blood on my shirt on purpose?" [as a minor side note now, could you please explain in full how his shield spell works in terms of durability, power cost, time limits (if any), etc? i just kind of feel odd that I didn't understand it and uncomfortable with continuing the matches until I figure it out][/u/AttackOnHaseeb , the fight can start now]"What, I need to protect myself. Plus that blood was probably from beating the shit out of them, not stabbing them.""That sounds both stupid looking and uncomfortable as shit." "Then why'd you suggest it? You like seeing little boys wrapped up or something?" [whole arm or just forearm?]"Not going to ask which inches you mean." [okay!]

"What's with the handle?" "Why do I hang out with you again?""It makes it hard to get a good grip on is what it does." "What, an innocent kid like me thinking things like that?" *He says with heavy sarcasm* "But seriously, I've got standards." "Mhm. Keep flattering yourself, your ego might get as big as 100's." "You're going to be getting that digging into your hand in the middle of a fight. Wear gloves if you really insist on using that thing." "Jesus, you really have a low enough opinion of me to think I'd do that?" "Kid, priorities." "So? Being an asshole and being a pervert are two different things, I'm the first one and you're probably the other." "So?" "Please, I've got the self-control to resist killing people and you think I can't keep hormones in control?" "That's subjective." "Are you seriously going to pretend either of us are normal?" "I repeat the question." "Exactly." "Depends on how much they pissed me off." "So, how've things been going for you?" "100 hasn't tried to kill you or anything again?" "Sweet. Some crazy bastard tried to kill me because he thought I killed his mom or something, but other than that I'm not too bad." so, he could just spend 10 points at the start of a fight to be effectively indestructible..?hm... i will take this into consideration. i'd rather not have him just banned from the tournament, because that would make some rather tricky working to try to get it back on trackjust give me a bit of time, i will try to get this figured out."Ya, he had superspeed so I just made speed not a factor." *He smiles a bit* "What's up? Sorry I haven't been around in a while, mom's been having me train and crap." "What, not even going to ask how I did it?" "By earth 'years'?" *He smiles* "We fought on the wall of a damn. Speed doesn't mean shit if you can't run on walls. Which, luckily, I can.""Let me think..." *He thinks for a few seconds* "About thirty." "God no. This place rules." "What?" *His smile changes to a slightly annoyed expression* "So are a lot of things." "Probably not.""SURE. SHOULD I MUTE MYSELF TOO?""Why did you think that?" "Oh sure, I get it, let's all pretend fighting for your life against drastically more powerful superhumans and surviving through tenacity means nothing at all." *He says sarcastically* "Hell ya. Also, abandoned buildings are cool." "Oh... How old did you *think* I was?" "Dwarves don't usually live that long." "We could get you a tent or something if you want. Anyway, we gonna go eat cupcakes?" *He rolls his eyes* "Smells great. Also, you know I'm here for you man." *He puts an arm around his shoulder with a smile as he walks into the church* "Whether you need me to kick someone's ass or just set up a tent." "Why's that?" "You know I would but I get the feeling you would just bitch at me more." [oh! hello! it is nice to see you here too! I hope you like the sub!]"I would recommend not using it then." [opps...?]

"Awesome! You're the best at baking, Juniper.""We can probably handle the smell somehow too." *He takes a bite out of the cupcake* "Have you considered finding less lethal magic types?" *He shrugs and goes to order himself something to drink* "I'm no mind reader, I can't control what he does with his own time." "That's why I'd handle it. Also, these cupcakes are awesome." "Why?" *He shrugs* "Well, then the choice is up to you." "Oh come on, All I've got on my plate now is beating some crazy guy who thinks I killed his mom and training." "Why not?" "Pft, not really." "Then find something to do." "Sorry..." *He looks like he feels like a bit of an asshole* "Juniper, I promise, he isn't going to do anything to you.""You could try making something." "Don't be, I'm here for you man." *He smiles at him* "What he does with his spare time is his business, not mine." "What do you enjoy making?" "Good. Now, I'm going to gorge myself on a few more of these cupcakes." "That is likely the best course of action. There are some conversations which should not happen in such open places after all." *Her eyes dart over to Pandora for a moment* "Then make them." "You think all guys are a little cute." "Well, I do not know how such customs work on Earth, but on Nidavellir most people do and make whatever makes them happiest." *She continues inside* *Even in her current mood she cannot hide her surprise at the beauty of this scene*[okay!]*Carnelia arrives in the party, even in her current mood the shockingly beautiful ballroom obviously surprises her.* [oh! okay! i was just going to check in and comment on their source comment things but I can link them too]*Lilith sits by her bed, looking very worried and obviously crying**She looks surprised to see her awake, and is rather happy to hear her voice. She holds Katie's hand, being extremely careful to not be too rough**Rather than answering, she hugs her.**She winces and lets go, backing off and writing a message that says SORRY....**Lilith later comes down to medbay with a large bowl of soup* *She sighs and writes I WAS WORRIED... I WANTED TO HELP...**She doesn't want to wake her up, and so tries (and probably fails) to walk up quietly* *She thinks, then shrugs and writes NOT TOO MANY BIG THINGS. She then thinks for another second, then seems to remember something and writes OH! AND I GOT A BOYFRIEND!**She sits next to the bed and places the soup nearby, sitting and waiting for Katie to show some signs of waking up* *She moves happily and points to the bowl of soup**She writes on a small piece of paper OTTO. HE IS GREAT before releasing a dreamy sigh**She gently pushes her back down, then picks up the bowl and holds it closer**She nods* *Lilith does her best to keep the bowl fairly steady and hands Katie a spoon**She writes HE IS NICE AND CUTE AND HE LISTENS TO ME!**Lilith looks a bit guilty about this, but then seems to have an idea. She puts the soup down and motions for Katie to wait for a moment, then runs off to get something**She writes NOT MOST OF THEM. YOU DO AND LAUGHING SHADOW KIND OF DOES AND BP DOES OCCASIONALLY, BUT NOT MOST OF THE REST OF THE CREW*"Well, are you more attached to the hammer or to your body parts?" "Yes you do. Don't joke around." *She seems happy about that**Lilith comes back with a straw*"Why not?" "Kid. Cut the mystic crap." *He rolls his eyes**She gives a thumbs-up* *She writes WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATTER, WHEN SOMEONE ELSE ISN'T AROUND and gestures in Laughing Shadow's direction**She looks both ways and writes in messy tiny letters ^BUT ^FOR ^THE ^RECORD ^HE ^TOTALLY ^IS**She thinks, then looks a bit scared and writes YES. THERE IS A SKELETON. HE IS TERRIFYING.*"You don't need to lie, man.""Hm. Your human economy seems to be such a liability." "Come on, I put in probably less than 0 effort into my appearance." "And a person can 'work' with no legs, it doesn't mean that's the best way for them to live." *She nods and then crumples the piece of paper, eating it so it would never be seen**HE IS A SKELETON! THAT'S HORRIFYING!*"OKAY. ""You and I both know it's more than a bad boy *look*"*He shrugs* "Alright then. Sorry if I'm not sure what is appropriate date conversation."*She writes I KNOW and smiles under her mask**HE'S STILL A SKELETON.*"YOU ARE NOW MUTED, I CAN STILL HEAR YOU THOUGH. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SET IT SO THAT I CANNOT HEAR YOU EITHER?""YES?""Sure. You pick, I don't know midgardian food well." "Seriously? You really need to get better taste in guys." *She seems happy about that**She huffs and writes SKELETON...**She writes I FOUND HIM HIDING IN A ROOM ON THE SHIP, HIS KITTEN CAME TO PLAY WITH ME**She shakes her head and writes IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM, HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ASK. I DON'T WANT HIM STEALING MY BONES OR ANYTHING*"That sounds good.""Suuuure." *He says with a sarcastic tone and a grin**She thinks for a second, then writes WELL, 'TALKING'. HE'S MUTE.**She huffs and writes I WILL ASK SOMEONE TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU ARE MY FRIEND. I AM TOO SCARED TO ASK HIM IN PERSON THOUGH. I LIKE KEEPING MY BONES ON THE INSIDE**She huffs and writes I WILL ASK SOMEONE TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU ARE MY FRIEND. I AM TOO SCARED TO ASK HIM IN PERSON THOUGH. I LIKE KEEPING MY BONES ON THE INSIDE**She nods**She thinks, then shrugs and says I AM BAD AT REMEMBERING WHO IS NEW OR NOT**She nods very happily* "OH YES. THAT REMINDS ME. YOU ASKED ME TO TELL YOU IF ANYTHING BAD HAPPENED TO CARRISA, CORRECT?""And don't get pouty. I said if you're going to use it then compensate for it, it's not totally unusable the handle is just crappy for getting a good grip in a fight, that can be fixed. Now, you said it was magic, mind being more specific?" "Hm.... How about [dwarvish word]? Do they have that?" "Me? Hm..." *He seems to be thinking pretty hard. Then he shrugs* *She writes SORRY**She gives a thumbs up* "I don't really have an answer. I guess I just don't think relationships would work out with me." "Oh... On second thought they probably don't. It's a plant from Nidavellir, it would be like asking for "chocolate" or "vanilla" on my homeworld." *She then writes SO, DO YOU WANT MORE SOUP?*"It's... Well, it's kind of..." *He is having trouble thinking of a way to explain it* "Like... Sweet...? It's hard to explain this kind of thing." "How fast?" *He shrugs* "I don't know what I want yet. I'm 15." *She writes WE CAN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE TO DATE. THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE AROUND ON THE SHIP AND BOTH OF US ARE TOO OBVIOUS LOOKING TO GO ASHORE.**She nods and holds the bowl and the straw up to her again* *She looks excited and says YES! SECRET BESTIE PLANNING SESSION!**He shrugs* "Maybe I am. My mom knew what she wanted to do at my age, though it was just 'be a crazy assassin and general delinquent'."*She gives a thumbs up and just barely avoids spilling the soup on Katie in the process* "Well, let me put it this way- how would you explain vanilla to someone who had never tasted a single food from earth?" *She thinks for a bit, then shrugs and writes in tiny print ^NOT ^WHILE ^LS ^IS ^AROUND, ^THIS ^NEEDS ^TO ^BE ^SECRET ^BESTIE ^PLANS**She puts the soup back down and then sighs**She nods and eats that paper as well* *She writes I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU... SORRY THIS IS ALL I CAN DO TO HELP...**She writes IT'S THE BEST WAY TO KEEP THE MESSAGES HIDDEN. IT TASTES TERRIBLE THOUGH*"Nice trick. After two hits you can manhandle most enemies." *She, far more gently this time, tries to hug her* *I DON'T LIKE GOING NEAR THE WATER She writes*"A fight that goes right won't last that long once you get close." "Oh... Sorry for bringing that up." "I'll trust your judgement then." "Kind of. To be honest she has me on a pretty loose leash, as long as I do my training." *He shrugs* "I still haven't decided" "Speaking of, if you want to take them down quickly you want to inflict pain and debilitate." "Boredom." "That's subjective." "No. You need something *really* painful. The kind of thing that's not 'so painful it's hard to keep fighting' but 'so painful you don't even *want* to keep fighting'." *He points to his collarbone* "Right here. Weaker than it looks and if you break it it's one of the most painful and debilitating things a human being can experience."*She is gentle, but obviously very worried about her**She writes GOOD POINT. BUT I MIGHT FORGET IT BEFORE THEN*"SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED."*She huffs, hugs her a bit tighter, then lets go and writes I'M STILL GOING TO KEEP WORRYING.*"I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE, BUT WE ARE IN JAPAN AND SHE THINKS SHE IS ON FIRE SOMETIMES AND A WOMAN WITH NEEDLES RANDOMLY STABS HER BUT SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND IT MUCH. ALSO SHE HASN'T WALKED ME IN DAYS."*She nods then seems surprised and writes OH YA! WE ALSO INVESTIGATED SEVERAL PURIFIER BASES*"Not for most people..." "Good point." "Not over, but damn close to it." *She writes I CAN STAY TO KEEP YOU SAFE WHENEVER YOU WANT*"YES. DO HUMANS DO THIS KIND OF THING OFTEN?""OH. WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN?"*She begins writing a fairly long series of messages, it says IN THE FIRST ONE ME, PSYCHO, AND DEJA VU WENT TO INVESTIGATE A NEARBY BASE, THEY WANDERED IN WITHOUT ME WHILE I DEALT WITH THE GUARDS THEN WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO THEY WANDERED OFF INSTEAD OF STAYING PUT LIKE I SAID WE SHOULD AND THEY GOT US FOUND AND WE HAD TO ESCAPE AND ALMOST DIED. THEN PAYLOAD AND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE YELLED AT ME FOR IT. She huffs and looks kind of upset about the situation**She smiles under her mask* "You could just talk with her about her weird anime obsession." "It's pretty fun for most people." "OKAY.""No." *His voice is very stern* "No. Fighting isn't a game." "OKAY. I WILL TRY TO REMEMBER TO DO THAT.""Ugh. I just don't want to hear her talking about her stupid 'moe' shows and prettyboys and crap.""Indeed." *She shakes her head glumly and says THAT'S WHY I GOT YELLED AT. I DID GET SOME OF THE WEAPON THINGS BUT SINCE DEJA VU AND PSYCHO RAN OFF WE FAILED THE MISSION.**She writes a message, then pokes Katie's nose and shows her it. It says BOOP*"She's weird." "Not. A. Game." *He sounds very serious* "When you fight you do it to end it quickly. You only ever fight to make sure you don't have to fight." "Of course not." *He places a straw in the milkshake and sits up a bit more so he can reach it more easily* "Why?" *He begins drinking the milkshake, looking slightly surprised* "Not as weird as her." "Try Alfheim." "You know she does most of the same stuff I do too, right?" "Home of the elves. Not the Dark elves though, the other ones." "She's the one who taught me." *She sighs* *She then takes off her mask, smiling* *She shrugs* *She nods and writes BP AND CAESAR INVESTIGATED ANOTHER BASE, I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER SPECIFICS BUT THEY BLEW UP A WALL**She holds Katie's hand and guides her to poke her nose, then holds up the boop card again* *She writes SOMEONE ON BP'S TEAM, HE CAN BE MEAN SOMETIMES BUT I THINK HE'S JUST BAD WITH PEOPLE**She smiles**[Carnelia](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3ut1va/day_six_the_celebration/cxhks4y) is there, she's avoided talking to anyone on the trip but now walks up to the group. She looks friendly, but her general affect is rather regal, almost draconian.**She writes I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO MAKING FOOD, GET SOMEONE TO COME GET ME IF YOU NEED ME**IF ANYONE CAN IT'S PROBABLY YOU she writes*"They're just called elves." "Pft. Nope." "YOUR WELCOME.""It's True."*She gives a thumbs up, then hugs her again* *She sighs and says IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN*

OOC: you can just write a conversation out in a post thingy if you like!*She pats her head and walks back to the kitchens* [indeed!]*She writes SHOULD I LEAVE YOU AND LS ALONE NOW..?**She writes I AM FINE WITH JUST STAYING HERE**[Carnelia](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3ut1va/day_six_the_celebration/cxhks4y) Makes her way to the snack table, she seems intent on getting some food too**She is quiet for a long while, then writes WHAT HAPPENED...?**Her breathing gets deeper and her face rather more-angry looking* "Probably the skin color." "I don't mean that as an insult. This is just pretty much what she expected." *Carnelia walks over to the table, examining the snacks like a drill sergeant looking at a line of recruits* *She returns a small wave with one arm while her other sleeve hangs limply at her side.* "So, how does victory feel?" *She still looks rather upset* *She clenches her fists.* [hm? what is going on?]*He shrugs* "Not really. It's just a job." *He gives him a bemused look, likely due to his own darkly-colored skin* [oh! okay! should I comment anything or is Lilith just going to be standing around listening?] [okay! one moment!]*She suddenly punches the wall, denting it* *Lilith looks very happy to have been chosen to go to the meeting in Katie's stead, and seems to be thinking very hard of a way to help with planning* *Lilith looks like she's crying now, and obviously too upset to write anything* [his skin is the color of [milk chocolate](http://www.foodnculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/23.7.20142.jpg)]"Come on, I can't cook." *She hugs her, somewhat tightly* *He shrugs* "Don't ask me, your people are the ones that named them that.""What, like a janitor?" *She is obviously very upset. She'll probably be able to communicate better after she calms down* *She eventually lets her go, and starts trying rather clumsily to write something* *After several tries resulting in scribbled messes, she finally manages to write SORRY**She begins trying to write again* *She writes IT'S NOT OKAY! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ISN'T OKAY! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT HAPPEN AND YOU DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT ON YOUR OWN!*"Hm. No offense, but it sounds like a lame job." "OKAY." *He hangs up* [okay!]"Ya, I just don't think I could do that without getting bored after a while." "Well, I would assume so. What will you do with your reward?" "Don't care about the money? Will you be letting Amber take it all then?" "Although... If I could do some work on the side..." *He smiles* *She rakes a small snack from the table, eating it and looking a bit happy. As she grabs another snack her other hand goes to- wait, her other hand? isn't that the one she lost? well, at the moment a black-gloved hand is clearly working.*"Not necessarily killing, but I want to do *something*" *She eventually looks over at the pair, her gloved hand going back to looking like a limp sleeve* "So, how are you two enjoying this so far?" *He shrugs* *She smiles* "Crass, but accurate.""Fair point." "I feel like some people don't really grasp how much money that is." "I don't think I can make that a job." *She sighs* "I just am a bit disappointed with how all this turned out." "How?" "Sounds preachy." "If I went and you wanted to come then sure." "Of course we'll be, we're best friends after all." "We won't. Promise." *He holds out his pinky finger* "Cool." okay! I rolled [magic intuition](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Intuition) [Plant Breath](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Plant_Breath) and [Fearful Scream](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Fearful_Scream)! 

Idea for the character! 

Name: Wiccah Willow

age: 16

Backstory: a young girl who was raised near an old haunted woods, she listened to the whispers of the spirits and the trees whenever she felt sad or depressed and became very attuned to their forces and magics. She has recently begun learning at the Cruxehn academy for magic, though most people find her to be a bit unnerving.

Powers: She is incredibly skilled at understanding magic, even able to understand the basics of magical abilities just by looking at it. More importantly, she has a strong tie to the spirits of her haunted woods, and can sing their songs to control plants and spread fear. 

[as another note, i really liked this! i might make her a character!]"What, today?" "I dunno if my mom will be home today." "Ya, on a job." *He shrugs, and says* "It varies. She can be gone for a few hours or a few months." "Meh, not too bad." "Mostly hang around with you or train." *She still looks upset* "What, you think you're boring?" *She huffs and writes I JUST WANT TO BE SURE YOU STAY SAFE*"Which is why hanging out with you isn't boring." "Training."*She nods and smiles a bit*"So, how did you come to have a sentient shadow?""Mhm. Any particular reason for it?"*She writes CAN I HUG YOU AGAIN?**She nods and carefully hugs her*"As in is there any particular reason you are sentient."*She lets go and writes I HOPE YOU GET BETTER SOON. I WILL CHECK ON YOU WHENEVER I CAN.*"Really? No family history of magic or anything?" *She returns a wide smile and a thumbs-up*"A shame." *Lilith, who had been mostly thinking this whole time, seems to have had an idea from that. She writes a message and hands it over to Wraith, it says YA! AND EVEN IF WE DO SOMETHING SNEAKY WE SHOULD STILL NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE WALL HOLE, THEY'LL EXPECT THAT**She writes MOSTLY JUST WAITING AROUND ON THE SHIP BEING WORRIED, SORRY IT'S NOT ANYTHING MORE INTERESTING*"I just meant they may have known something important regarding your tenebrous friend."[oh! i am guessing i did something bad...? sorry...]*She shrugs and writes I TRIED COOKING*[so... why were you screeching then...?]"Evidently. Well, unless you get into necromancy, I won't judge." *She shrugs* "Suit yourself. Also, I would kindly prefer not to be called 'dude'." *She writes I THINK IT WENT GOOD-ISH!**She looks a bit bemused.* *She thinks of responding, but then instead sticks her tongue out and then goes back to looking at snacks with a small grin* [oooooh. so... i did good...?]*She holds her arms up happily, one of her hands has a card saying YAY**She takes another snack, her other arm wriggles to life again and pours her a bit of punch*[oh! that sounds good i think! yay!]*She starts listing things off, writing NAVY BEAN SOUP, SUSHI, SPAGHETTI, SHARK, AND BEEF THINGS**She eats the snack and goes back to drinking the punch, her sleeve going back to normal. She seems to pout slightly for a moment* [alright, I'll just have her be an NPC, this is taking a while]

*Angel is waiting there already, doing some stretches to prepare for the fight* "Hm?" *She looks over, secretly happy someone finally brought it up* "What, this one?" *The sleeve springs to life again, moving like a normal arm, and waves at her* *She nods* "Yo, nice to see you're finally here." *She stands up and looks at him with a bit of a smile* "Did they really have to send a little kid though?" *She grins* "Well, it's only polite to ask first." "Kid, that's the next rule. Don't think like that." *She laughs* "Hold it chico, remember the rules for the match. We need to get our weapons out of that thing, nothing we brought with us." *She points to a medium-sized crate nearby with a large K on it*[just currently canon characters or can it be one of the other people rolled up in this?] "You know you might die, but you can't let that be the first thing on your mind. Think about it this way- you always *can* die, you could die getting out of bed for all you know. Just keep it out of the spotlight.""And for your answer, this is just how magic makes life easier." *She shrugs and begins to open it* "So, you gonna pick roller blades or roller skates, chico?" "Ma-gic. You know, that stuff that smart and skilled people can use. Also some uppity peasants." "Ya, you didn't know that? Blades have the wheels in a row, skates have them like a car." *She pulls a small warhammer out of the crate* "Good. Now, there's not much else I could teach you without actual training." [yay!]

*Wiccah Willow is calmly humming and walking into the graveyard with a small basket, it seems to have some flowers in it. People nearby would think she looks a bit crazy, likely due to her casually speaking to what they see as 'nothing at all'. In reality, she is having some rather pleasant conversations with the local spirits* *If smug could kill then Carnelia's face just broke the Geneva conventions* "Well, you're the one who asked." "Hm? You *do* know these are picked for us, right? You can't pick. Also, this one says-" *She looks over the hammer, and finds her name scribed onto the hilt* "Ew, I have to use this thing? Blech." [okay! Laine's wife would keep him around for dinner and probably make him help with Dishes, after that he could go look for Hati*]*She turns around with a small smile, she had just been speaking to what seemed to be the spirit of a rabbit* "Hello reaper." *She does a small curtsy* "Sorry if I'm disturbing you, I just wanted to see if any of the spirits wanted some flowers or a nice chat. I can go if you'd prefer privacy." [sure! where would he look for her first?] *inside the crate is a rather well-made shinai with his name carved into the hilt. Looks like that's his weapon, Angel looks at it with a bit of a pout* "Lucky." "I have lots of friends who are spirits." *She hums a small tune and a few roots come up from the ground, forming into a small stool of sorts which Wiccah sits on* "What, you don't want to know it now?" "I understand, it's in your nature." *she doesn't seem to be up on any rooftops at the moment* *She pouts a bit* "Hey! don't go disrespecting it, chico." *She takes off her boots and begins strapping on a pair of rollerblades* *Well, he should check another place she often hangs out.* "I met them in my forest." "So, going with rollerblades instead of skates?" [end?] *He might want to think back to where they first met, what kind of a place was it?* "I just got to know them, we've been friends for a long time." *She thinks a bit, then says* "As long as I can remember." *Well, when sprinting through alleys, he may hear a somewhat mournful sigh out of a dumpster* "Sweet." *She stands, she looks very steady in the rollerblades* "Only the ones who feel like talking." *She does eventually make her way over, she is mildly suspicious of this newcomer* "I do not believe we have met thus far, which is odd considering how few people were on the mission." *She smiles very wide* *A small eep can be heard from inside* *She smirks a bit at that* *He shrugs* *She nods* *She raises an eyebrow* "Well, perhaps if you prove yourself to be a ***cut above*** the rest we will have a good relationship." *She smirks* *She's curled up in the bottom of it, covering her head with her scarf* "Sure chico." *She says sarcastically* *She shrugs* "It depends on the spirit." *She does an 'oh you' kind of hand wave with a smile* *She shakes her head and writes I'VE ONLY DONE IT TWICE I THINK*"Eep!" *She looks a little surprised. Luckily this dumpster doesn't have any trash in it at the moment* "Ready when you are." *She looks happy with that* "What? I'm a boring guy." "I try not to speak to anyone who is unpleasant." "I know, the spirits told me." "I'm not fun..?" "Not really, but thank you for asking." *She shrugs* ooc: honestly, i like 1 on 1 pvp! 

ic: *Lilith shrugs and writes A FAST PERSON? IM NOT SURE REALLY.**Lilith grabs a large number of porkchops.*"Ouch." *She thinks, then just writes FOOD**She waves goodbye* "Have a nice day."*She shrugs and writes I LIKE A LOT OF FOOD**She nods**She gives a thumbs up to that*"I do, they're just very few of them." *She shakes her head**She was, at the moment, curled up in a ball. Now she's kind of just staring at him, looking surprised*"Count of three?""I just did, training and hanging out with you."[okay!]*She is kind of just listening to him ramble for a while here* *She writes ONCE YOU FEEL BETTER WE CAN COOK TOGETHER!*"One... Two..." *She begins to glow slightly*"..." *She tilts her head* "Sparky why are you freaking out so much?"*She writes WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE?*[what..?]"Why?"*She writes CAKE. LOTS OF IT.**She seems happy with this answer* *She nods in agreement and writes I WILL BE UPSET TOO IF YOU DON'T REST. I WANT YOU TO GET BETTER.**She writes GOOD. IS IT OKAY IF I STAY HERE FOR A WHILE..?**She nods* *She writes I WANT TO KEEP YOU SAFE**She smiles and does a small salute, writing out a message that says I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE TEAM CAPTAIN!*[end?][okay! think i should link in LS so he and Lilith can talk?][okay! /u/FFRBP777 want to have LS talk to Lilith since she basically volunteered herself to be part time guard dog for Katie?]*She nods*[okay!]

*After her conversation with Katie, involving several small messages she showed only to Katie and then immediately ate to keep secret, she looks at Laughing Shadow after Katie begins to go to sleep again and holds up a sign saying ALSO, HI LS.**She writes I CAN DO THAT! PROBABLY!**She cracks her knuckles* *She writes a message that says THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY THINK I CAN WRITE A WAY TO SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH.**She starts thinking again, that idea probably took a lot of thought* *She writes IS IT OKAY IF I HUG YOU..?**She picks him up in a large bear hug, smiling wide. The hug is probably a bit tight, but not downright dangerous.**She eventually puts him back down and releases him from the hug.* *She writes MOSTLY. SERIOUSLY THOUGH, THANK YOU.**She looks to make sure that Katie looks like she's sleeping, then writes WE NEED TO KEEP KATIE SAFER FROM NOW ON.**She shrugs and writes I WAS JUST GOING TO KEEP STANDING AROUND HER TO I CAN BEAT ANYONE WHO ATTACKS HER INTO A PUDDLE**She writes ALWAYS MOST DEFINITELY**She shrugs and writes I HAVEN'T REALLY ASKED YET**She pouts a bit**She writes BUT WE CAN'T LET SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!**She looks a bit upset about this answer* *[Carnelia](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3ut1va/day_six_the_celebration/cxhks4y) makes her way over, holding some punch**She pouts and writes I'M STILL GOING TO GUARD HER WHILE SHE GETS BETTER.**She writes I MEAN, EVEN IF SHE WANTS ME TO NOT GUARD HER, WHILE SHE'S TOO SICK TO EVEN GET OUT OF BED SHE'S GETTING A GUARD WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT**She pouts. It seems she considers this non-negotiable* [oh! okay!]

"Three!" *With a flash, she disappears, appearing right in front of him, her hammer already swinging at his gut* "And?" [they need to stay in the maze, it's not that huge][i know, i just mean that a 1km range means less since they aren't allowed to go nearly that far from each other]"So, how does it feel to be center of attention?" "Well, you will likely have to get used to it." *Her swing continues, but she is sent sprawling back screaming from the fire* "Sparky, I can handle myself." "Have you talked with Alex yet?" "YOW" *She swears in Spanish for a bit* "Why does everyone use fire?" "Hm? Why?" "Well, you may want to do that before he gets any ideas about the rewards." "Jesus it's fire all over the place in these fights." "Not really. Why?" "Weeell you should discuss the reward before he gets too attached to any ideas of what he will do" "Not with me, with him obviously. I was just reminding you to do it." "What? No, Alex is the one on screens and things all congratulating him for winning."question! would they know AV? I know Jason does but I don't know about the others"Hm... That last pun felt a little ***dull***.  You should ***hone*** your skills a bit more."okaaaay. just asking if they know. "Bro, chill." [okaaaay]*She shrugs* "Just being polite" "Well, did you do the thingy I asked?" "Well, so did I?" "Oh... And what about Thor?"i think Alva would be good! we need more things happening in NCas. 

also, minor question with faith healer, would his powers work on non-earthlings? *She sighs* "Dude, chill. Ready to keep going?" *She turns back towards him, she has some burns on one side of her face now, probably just first or second degree, but her hair is a bit singed there as well* *She seems to shrugs him off as she starts climbing out of the dumpster* "Don't get so cocky." *She starts lightly glowing again*[did you drop this?]*Carnelia is nearby, drinking punch. She looks a bit bemused with how all of this played out.* i was just wondering since, even if they have an equivalent of an endocrine system, aliens may not use the same chemicals for the same reactions. *She smiles* "You're not my type." *She suddenly disapears, he probably has a moment to guess where she'll pop up, will he swing at it, or fireblast at it?**She gets out of the dumpster, standing in a slouched generally sad-looking position* [how big is the ring?]"Well, I better go now..." [alright, just checking]

*Her hammer goes through where he used to be standing as she appears behind the circle*"What..?" *Well, now her hammerhead is no fire* "Uh... Thanks for the upgrade?""I need to go tell her though." *She begins skating at him, building speed pretty fast*"okaaaay." *She looks generally depressed, she can barely stand up* yes, I read your plan and yes it would work. he can access everything the phone can do. *As they near, she swings the hammer, barely keeping her balance* *She begins slowly making her way towards Thor's place. He might want to think about if this is a good idea or not* yay!indeed! i didn't think AV would ever be useful! "So, you plan on doing anything with the research part of the reward?"*It goes right over him and she almost falls over, her momentum keeps carrying her past him on her skates*"No, I need to do this thingy." *I meant more 'a good idea for her physical health since Alice said she'll torture Hati to death if she ever sees her again', Mr.Blade.*"Of course, I need to let them know I didn't want this to happen."  *I don't doubt she would, but alright.* *Legs seems more realistic at that angle, anyway that in addition to the unbalancing sends her flying, she lands facefirst on the ground* yay!"You just said you never told Thor." fancy!"I want to make sure." *She stands up, her nose is heavily bleeding, maybe broken* "Pft, just from that? No way chico."*She nods in agreement* *She nods glumly*"I have not tried one, but wouldn't exactly be opposed to it. It's been quite a while since I have had alcohol though." 1: I intended to not really base it on a stat and just leave the effects on a person up to the other person's RPer, since different people may have wildly different interactions to it. I could add a stat for "above this they can just no-sell it and feel nothing" though. 

2: yes, but most of the effects (other than sealing/forbidding) don't do much to spirits. out of the ones that *can* affect spirits: 
 
* Forbidding charms make an area a few meters across in which it takes about 50x the effort for a spirit to move into it, they can move away from it normally. They can be 'linked' together with strings or ropes around something to make the field encompass that thing, for example putting them around a house. The pain ones, instead of making it difficult to move in, make the spirit experience pain the closer they get to the charm or whatever it is protecting, culminating in the worst pain they could imagine if they tried to actually touch it. 

* Sealing charms work basically the same way, but rather than a field it is a 'bubble' that takes large amounts of effort to move out of. the pain thing still works, basically just being a bubble that hurts to touch. Neither Forbidding nor Sealing charms can be touched directly by spirits or their powers (so a fire-breathing spirit can't just fireblast a charm), even those who can normally interact with the physical world, but they can be indirectly messed with if the spirit can affect physical objects (for example, a telekinetic spirit could make a normal object fly at the paper charm and cut it in half)

* Revealing just makes the spirit appear without any form of illusion to disguise or hide its appearance to whoever is looking through the charm

* Peace prevents anyone from raising the body or spirit from the dead *against the spirit's will*, if the spirit wants to come back it still can. It also helps prevent the spirit from being consumed by negative emotions, basically just helping them think straight. "Kid, I'm not going to give up over just a busted nose.""What does that have to do with it...?" yay! thank you! [I think I'll let this play out before the announcement thingy happens]"What's that supposed to mean?"*She just looks confused*[would you mind if the interaction her and willow had in the original randomizer event thing was canon?][yay!]

*Willow rather calmly walks over to the graveyard upon hearing the scream* *She grins* "What, no more puns? Are you not used to an attaque au fer? I was sure you could ***parry*** such a light ribbing." "Nothing in particular, I was just having a chat with a few lovely redcaps and heard a scream as I was headed back to the academy." "Oh. Goodbye then sir." *She says with a small wave to the portal to the underworld* "Is it? But if I don't wander around now then I won't get to speak to some of the spirits." "I have plenty of friends.""Sometimes." "Do you count, or are we still just acquaintances?" "One moment please." *She takes off her backpack and pulls out a small strip of paper and a small old-fashioned looking pen*"Helping his spirit be at peace, just in case." *She draws a few symbols on the paper tag, and places it on the earth on top of where the portal opened* "It is only polite." "If you would like, I still do not need to be back to my room for quite a while." "I understand." *She stands up, gently brushes some of the graveyard dirt off of her legs, and begins to walk* "Would you like to keep our walk to just in the cemetery?" "I was mostly leaving it up to you, I have no preference either way." "Aw, don't be so upset about your pun theme being ***foiled*** for a bit, I won't tell anyone." "Alright, Have you been here before?" *She begins walking out into the streets* "Good, if I were giving a tour I would likely forget some things." "Did I sound worried? I apologize for that." "Alright." *She seems almost eerily calm, especially for someone taking a walk with a grim reaper* "Of course not." *While she is speaking to several people and wearing a dress that might be reminiscent of a certain kind of spider, she doesn't seem to be doing anything evil.* "I would not mind that at all." *He might also notice a few times that her missing arm seems to have had tales of its destruction greatly exaggerated, judging by the fact that she's picking things up with it. Whenever the gloved and sleeved hand isn't in use it goes back to looking like just a sleeve though*"So, is that what you do with most of your time?" *His infrared would notice that the sleeve has no body heat within it, the actual sleeve and glove seem to be moving on their own without anything inside* "Do you enjoy it?" *She eventually looks over at him, the whole time since she's gotten to the party she's had a somewhat regal air about her* *She gives a small wave*"What else do you do? Do you have hobbies?" *Which doesn't bother her much. She does begin to walk over to him though* "I find relaxing to be a wonderful hobby." "And to you. So, how are you enjoying the party?" "And would it be safe to assume that being here as one of the losers does not help?" "There are ways you could have done that without nearly getting people trying to make honest money killed, you know." "May I ask something?" "Then why bother going on a trip specifically to find one?" "And then you just let them take it anyway?" "How did you come to be?" "You realize she's not keeping it, yes?" "Interesting. My friends have told me little about grim reapers." "Shit!" *She tosses the hammer away, narrowly avoiding getting caught on fire*"And do you trust others with it?" "Ah. Don't worry, I don't judge people for laziness." "Not all of my friends are dead." "Many people care what others think of them." "Some of them." "I think I covered this before." "Well, lazier than some.""Others do not though." "Some would have tried to stop it." "I know." "It's alright, not many people pay attention to me." "Ever consider other people have reasons to fight too?" "Well, either way I am fairly sure Alex had plans for that part of the reward." "What..?" *She rolls her eyes and begins glowing again as she turns and starts skating in the opposite direction* *At which point, while his back is turned, she teleports back to the flame-headed hammer and tosses it at his back*"Well, he does apparently seem intent on simply giving his share of the money away." *She looks a bit annoyed at this*"Still, I find it rather... Jarring. He *actually won*, and he chooses to simply toss it all away.""Ha! Didn't see that one coming!"*She pouts a bit**She sighs and sarcastically says* "Great, just toss away more of the mindbogglingly huge reward you managed to win.""What, like little girls with no family or job and a missing limb who live in ruins instead of an actual home and have not a single worldly possession?" "Indeed, even if you insist on making such ***lam\u00e9*** puns.""Hm. If only someone like that could have gotten the money." *She says with a hint of sarcasm* "Only if you ***pass\u00e9*** me something to drink after that, it wasn't even a sword pun." "Hm? Oh really?" *A speaker on a single light post in the parking lot crackles to life and says* "CONGRRRRATULATIONS! NEGAIHOSHI YUUKI, you have won this round, and are one step closer to completing the Grand Lion's Tournament and earning your wildest dreams! You may leave when you so choose." *The speaker shuts off**No response. Looks like there might not be someone coming to bury him this time.*"I take it you don't know fencing well then? In that case you might wish to rethink attempting to ***crois\u00e9*** wits with me when it comes to sword puns.""Floor, in front of you. Pay closer attention chico." [end?] "Ditto." *She grins* "And how would you know?" "So, you going to stop whining so we can fight?" *She jokes* "I mean how would you know who's cruel? If you just donate it to some random charity, any of the people who benefit could be monsters, plus most of the money will go to advertising and running the charity.""No, it aint, now stop the edgy bullshit." *She begins skating towards him*"What, going to research every poor orphan in the world?" *She begins to glow as they near*"Make me." *She taunts* *She teleports beside him, her leg held out in front of his*"What, can't keep up with someone who puts some ***flourish*** into their work?""If that were True then these things wouldn't be a problem in the first place." [she's not making it or anything, it's a naturally occurring spirit of nature, she just is magically attuned enough to see it without assistance]*She is saying some rather odd things* "You really should leave those redcaps alone, they're just looking for a nice place to settle in the attic, they should move on on their own in a bit." *She might notice someone from a her school, a girl with wings instead of arms, taking a walk and looking a bit sick and miserable* A bad Trish fanfic would probably be the essence of edgy, with constant raining and gritty speaches every few minutes

---

Hati and Skoll both easily lend themselves to anime-ish random power boosts, things like "You tried to kill me, but my RAW WILLPOWER un-killed me!" 

---

Bernard i kind of the anti-cringe, the only cringey stories you could write would involve totally changing his character so that he constantly whines about how humans are destroying the planet and making all humans in the story mustache-twirling evil. That or make it a werewolf-y story dealing with an "inner conflict" about him totally not being a bear.

---

An edgy Akki story would be like the Bernard one I just mentioned, a big inner conflict thing with her "oni mode" being super gorey and violent to a ridiculous degree

---

Dolly's really too normal for this, ironically.

---

Carnelia would probably have massive complicated Xanatos gambits that always turned out her way

---

Brokkr would constantly angst about how his people hate him, which is... Actually kind of what he does now. Am I writing him badly...? *She looks over, noticing her* "Hm...? Oh, you're that elf from school, right? Hi..." *She sounds tired. Her wings look a bit ratty at the moment, some feathers falling out as she walks* "Hm? Oh don't worry, I'm just molting." "Oh, guess not everyone knows that... It's a thing birds do sometimes." "They do it to get rid of old feathers. I'm not sure why I do it." "All I know is it makes me feel like crap..." [well, he could still talk to her or something, or if he knows any revealing magic kind of stuff he could see it][okay. He could just talk to her though.][wait, I have an idea]

*As he walks down the street, a lamp post near the girl suddenly seems to snap in half. She keeps talking to what seems to be thin air with a slightly scolding tone to her calm voice*[fall]"Hm?" *She looks over to him, tilting her head* "Whatever do you mean?" "I didn't knock it down, he did." *She points at thing air, her voice sounds oddly calm* "I've been scolding him about it already." "Oh, I keep forgetting that. One moment-" *She takes off her backpack and starts to look through it, if he looked in he would see some odd things, like pouches of small bones and gardening tools* *She takes out a small slip of paper with a few symbols written on it, they look like they might be Japanese. She pokes a hole in it with her finger and hands it over* "Here, try looking through this." *It seems to be a fairly simple revealing charm, when he puts it over his eye he would see a large bear with antlers standing next to the girl**It seems that they don't work right on 3d glasses* *She sighs* [there's more to magic then just the drawing, like how in Harry Potter even if you know the words for a spell you can't instantly do it without practice. Also, they're the wrong shape.]

"Sorry about that. Will my charm do for now?" [indeed he could, just not instantly. Also, still the wrong shape]

"This is Mr.Branglewiz, he has been having some trouble with redcaps in his attic and got a bit emotional about it.""So... You said you wanted to open a bakery, right?"

[also, did the brokkr thingy get dropped?][what?]"Of course not! That would be far too rude and violent.""I'm sure they will move on on their own shortly." [while he's already traveling forward?]"Well, they don't want to impose, they just need somewhere to stay for the moment while they find a new stump." "No, I was just telling you what is likely to happen. Did it seem like I was making a request? I apologize if so." "About what?" "Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? How rude of me. I am Willow Yanagi, it is a pleasure to meet you." *She does a small curtsy* "And this is  Mr.Branglewiz" *She gestures to the bear, who does a small nod* "He's a local nature spirit."*She can, she just doesn't think it's that important at the moment* "So, is there anything else you don't understand?" [well, he did constantly make fun of her during their fight][/u/jellysnake please continue]"Taking a walk."[indeed, but she doesn't know that][it's okay!]

"True, but even if I don't actively seek something does not mean I am afraid of it." "Not all of them are really capable of that anymore." "He was not trying to be a terror, that was an accident." "That is good to know." "Talk with my friends, grow plants, study, take walks, make charms. Lots of things." *She notices that* "Why are you staring?""Plus, he already apologized. I'm not sure if anyone heard or understood him other than me but he apologized." "I see. Hopefully they will not cause much trouble when they run out of time." "Sorry to hear that." *She looks over, tilting her head* "Oh, it won't be for long, their last home was just destroyed so they need to put their things somewhere for a day or two." "Have you tried explaining it to them?" "Well, it's not my attic first of all. Plus, if they do settle in Mr.Branglewiz's attic I am sure they could be politely asked to leave." "I am sorry to hear that.""Indeed it does." "Oh, farewell then. Feel free to keep the charm, though it won't last very long if you aren't careful."[yes, but would he be able to react and do it before she hits him?]"Have fun with that." "May I ask a somewhat personal question?" "Where will you do it?" "Do you eat?" "I see. That must be awfully convenient." "Can you also eat as much as you like?" "I kind of expected that." "Goodbye Mr.Knight" "What kinds of food do you like to eat?" "It depends entirely on which ones." "Which, if I must, I may have to resort to." "Blech. You'll just get robbed." "I understand." [she actually is a fair couple points higher in reflex and equal in skill, though skill wouldn't matter because they're both 5's without their skilled weapon]"I do." "But you don't live there with a few billion euros." "I like kumquats." "Have you tried one?" *And she still gets hit by his fire hand, catching her shirt on fire* "Fucking fire dammit!" *Spanish swearing*"You should sometime." "Did you have to learn what you do?" "Interesting." *She chuckles* "You really shouldn't try to slip a threat in the middle of a pun barrage, it makes both seem less effective. And for the record, I won't do anything involving Amber she doesn't want me to do." "I learned most of what I do from my friends." "Yes." "They can be quite amiable, even the ones people think are normally rude." "I have met a few rather polite redcaps. Admittedly not many but a few." " And I suspect you have had to deal with the victims of wolfs and tigers as well."*She laughs* "Really?" "Oh yes, I am sure that more money will give people no additional incentive to rob you." "I just lost several billion Euros in addition to everything I own, my pride, and my arm. Forgive me if I am not particularly cheery." "But not all of those are bad either. They're rather cute too." *She looks slightly bemused, but just sighs* "Do you not like wolves?" "Woo, I can't wait to make a 'fresh start' without my arm." *She is incredibly sarcastic* "May I ask something? What did *you* lose?" "And made a profit of ten billion euros plus superpowers and a magic sword. Sounds like a good deal, at least compared to 'lose everything you own including things you worked decades to make and keepsakes from your dead mother and also your arm and in return get to go to a party'. Oh, though you got to go to the party too, so I guess we're even on that reward." *She shrugs* "Nothing I can do about it." "You alright...?" "What's wrong? If you don't mind saying I mean." *She shrugs* "Alright, your choice." *She just keeps walking, leaving feathers behind* "Mhm." *She takes a drink of her punch*

[it's okay! i can go find it in a bit!]*She shrugs and goes back to being generally imperious and annoyed in the party* [here is the thingy that got dropped!][oh, also, /u/TwilitKing, sword may be upset with Carnelia just guilt tripping Amber][indeed! you might want to have her talk to sword or something][oh, i think that thing with my comments not showing up is happening again. let me try re-submitting it]*He shrugs* "Don't ask me, your people are the ones that named them that.""Do you like any animals?" "Uh, no? I'm on fucking roller blades I can't do acrobatic bullshit." "Humans. We call them Alves and Svartalves, because that's what they call themselves." "Oh. Do you like any people?" "Interesting. It sounds a bit lonely." "I don't mind it." "I could show you pictures of the svartalves." *She just keeps chatting away, something about willow-the-wisps, when a small crater about a foot wide- and also foot shaped- appears in front of her* *Heavy metal footsteps can be heard as someone walks down the street closer to the alley* "I would make a comeback but I got no clue what you just said." *Her stance seems steady, if only he had a power specifically useful for destabilizing people who are already in a situation where it is hard to keep your balance.* *She begins glowing* "What the..?!" *She slips, falling over as she suddenly disappears. She appears behind him, still falling, and slams her head off the floor.* *Well, she already doesn't seem to be moving on the ground, but with that she's definitely not moving. She's still breathing but she seems to be unconscious* *The speaker system crackles to life* "COOONGRRRRATULATIONS! JOSEPH CORTEZ, YOU HAVE WON THE SECOND ROUND OF THE LION'S TOURNAMENT AND ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO YOUR WILDEST DREAMS! You may leave when you so choose!" *The speakers shut off*

[also, did you drop the Hati thing?][end?][okay!]

*Later, after getting her wounds treated at a hospital, Angel wakes up. She looks at her phone next to her bed, the screen says* YOU HAVE 20 UNHEARD MESSAGES FROM- MOM *She puts the phone down and sighs* "Ooooh boy..." *She gives a thumbs-up* "One moment." *He takes his visor back out of his pocket, puts it on, and begins searching for something. He hands over the visor, it has various pictures of the Dark Elves*

[i can link some of their lore things if you don't know what they look like in canon] "No Sparky, I want you to say what you mean." [they look basically the same as the dwarves do except their skin ranges from the darker ranges of the dwarve's skin (like Brokkr) to actually literal black. Also they like wearing heeled shoes and all of them either smile or frown slightly all the time, usually smile. Their ears are also barely pointier]*She hugs him again for not stopping her from doing this* *She writes REMIND ME TO COOK YOU SOMETHING AT SOME POINT**He looks bemused at this reaction* *She then goes back to sitting by Katie's bed, dutifully guarding her* *She pouts at him* [end?] /u/demonwor1d would BP like to say anything about what just happened? basically Lilith begged LS until he said she could stick around and help guard Katie"They're Dark Elves." *She writes I WON'T TAKE THAT CHANCE as she puts her mask back on*"They regularly rob my people." *She nods, but writes PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER**She sighs and writes I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF THAT THOUGH...*"Why?"*She writes IT'S MY BIGGEST UPSIDE! THAT AND THE HUGS.*"Why?"*She writes WANT ONE? I NEED TO THANK YOU FOR HELPING WITH KATIE'S WOUNDS**She writes OF COURSE I HAVE TO THANK YOU! SHE'S NOT EVEN YOUR SQUAD LEADER AND YOU STILL HELPED!*"Hm? I don't see why not." "Hm? You mean the Boogeyman? He's some manner of fear spirit who's been following along." "Not at all, you're too tall."*She writes DON'T BE SO DOWN, WE'RE FRIENDS NOW SO GET USED TO BEING THANKED**She writes HOW LONG UNTIL KATIE IS BETTER, BY THE WAY?*"That is good. Mine was pleasant as well." *She writes REALLY? DOES IT TASTE GOOD?**She writes I WILL KEEP MAKING MORE SOUP THEN! SHE CAN'T JUST HAVE DISGUSTING ENERGY DRINKS**He seems lightly surprised at that, but not upset. Other people in the restaurant might be giving a few odd looks.* *She writes CHICKEN BROTH. BEST THING FOR WHEN YOU'RE SICK.**She writes NEED HELP?**He sighs* "Humans are so oddly judgmental." *She nods and grabs the items, handing them over happily* "But I'm not a kid." *She does, looking worried*"A little girl?" *He sounds offended* "Hmph..." "You think it's funny, don't you?" *He pouts*"Why? Because I'm a freak?" *He mumbles, half to himself**She still looks worried, but doesn't write anything* "Sorry, that was uncalled for..." *He looks a bit guilty* "Plenty." "Humans often think that."*She does her best to be gentle* *She looks rather shocked at that, and gags a bit* "Thank you." *She writes I HAVE, BUT NOT FROM ONE OF MY FRIENDS**She nods and passes it, she seems to be shaking a bit* "You also are unique, at least among the people I have met." "Knowingly?" "Fair point." *She takes a deep breath and nods* "I am different." *She writes ASSISTANT?*"Do you need to bring them to the graveyard?" "Why?" "What about crematoriums?" *She thinks about it, then nods in agreement* "Things that I did when I was a child mostly." "What about other places with many dead?"*She goes up to him once he is done washing his hands, and suddenly hugs him* "Hm?" *Brokkr walks past, stopping at the alley and looking in* "Like battlefields." *He walks over, intrigued by her obviously not being human* "Are you alright? Or are you just going to jibber?" *He walks over and forms some of his armor into a stick, poking her* *He sighs* "When I was a child I showed some traits which would seem decidedly... elven." [it's not iron]"Like... Humans tend to not notice these." "Hm." *He retracts it, and looks for any obvious wounds* "Hm... Well, human hospital it is." *His armor reforms, making a golden net, which then tries to pick her up* "This might help." *He flips through a few things on his visor, then hands it over. It shows an [excerpt from some pamphlet]( https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/3tynoz/on_svartalves_and_nidavellirians/)*"What?" *She sounds slightly offended* "Hm... That's probably bad." *He forms a helmet for himself* *Especially since Brokkr doesn't seem to fit a lot of them.* *He simply begins floating her to a hospital in the net* "As I said, I only did such things when I was a child." *The ropes wear down a bit, but he adds more mass to them* *She lets him go, then writes THANK YOU FOR ALL THIS. SERIOUSLY.*"Walking on my toes was a big one..." *He seems somewhat uncomfortable about the subject*"Plenty of battlefields are blessed afterwords." *She smiles under her mask and writes ME TOO. I DON'T GET TO BE USEFUL OFTEN.*"Almost no dwarven children do that. My attention span also did not help." "How so?" "Do I *look* like a human?" *She seems rather proud of this, and writes I WILL DO MY BEST!**Yep, he kind of just drops her in the lobby* "Not on earth it wouldn't." "No idea, I found her jibbering in an alleyway." "Why not? We are genetically different from humans. Those behaviors are not normal." *Brokkr doesn't really care much, so he just makes sure someone actually comes to take care of her rather than leaving her there* "Fine..." *She pouts* "Lead wherever *you* want to go" "Not to a human." "Alright. Let's go." *He does, however, stick around to see if she wakes up and stops speaking jibberish any time soon* *He eventually goes to see her at her hospital bed* "So, done with that gibberish yet?" *He follows, taking a bit more effort to keep up due to his size* *She writes NOT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK THAT...*"Good. Are you healthy?" *She shrugs* "Good." *It is worth noting that he is a huge imposing gold-armored figure* "Now, why exactly were you jibbering in an alleyway?" *She writes NOT MUCH, MOSTLY JUST WORRYING...*"Hm? Do you know who and why?" "I don't think you're *incapable* of understanding me." *She nods, then hugs him again* "Pity. Any particular reason they branded you as far as you know?" "Did I say something impolite again?" "So, it needs to have a holy construction in order to be considered hallowed ground?" *She salutes, holding up a sign that says YES SIR*"Does the religion matter?" "The burn on your forehead would say otherwise." *She goes and sits back next to Katie*[happy cake day by the way!]i was kind of hoping the black hat thugs would look [like this](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/01019335a376c85214c038fa6fb30c12/jibetuk/o8rnhmak3/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_d40m0b0xrogkwckk8cskw0ogg_640.gif)"Hm. What classifies as a 'religion'?" "And?" "Most people don't seem to. Even the races that know us better, like Asgardians, think we are strange." *She follows, looking a bit generally upset* yay! will there be a DJ Deadb3ar?"Ah. Acute chemical reaction to ferrous materials." [end?] *He rolls his eyes and his visor replays a recording of her saying* ^"Iron ^burns""And you will likely be capable of it, just not immediately." [your cake day, it means the yearly anniversary of you making your reddit account.]"How would you define 'holy'?" "I'm guessing from your appearance that you aren't human." *Once they reach the bridge, she says* "So, what did you want to say?" "Then what are you?" "You think?""Is that all?" "And?""And do you have any reason not to believe them?" "Hm... What counts as a 'deity'?" "Then it is safe to assume you are an elf. I am a Dwarf." "What about religions which lack deities?" "Sorry to hear that." "I would suspect boredom, you could go ask him if you like." "And what does that have to do with me going to make sure they know first?" "So, you cannot go to Buddhist burial grounds?" *He sighs, looking slightly annoyed* "Many people say that." "And they need to know." OOC: I could see Lilith fitting well in any superhero story with a big hero team (Justice League in DC or Avengers/X-Men in Marvel for example). I think it would be pretty interesting, especially since she would almost certainly be mistaken for a villain at first. It might be fun to see something like some of the Avengers getting into a scrap with her and then Professor X trying to break it up when he finds her with cerebro and realizes she's basically friendly. 

IC: *Lilith writes SNOW! LOTS OF IT! ALSO FOR KATIE TO BE BETTER BY THEN SO WE CAN PLAY IN THE SNOW TOGETHER*"That must make finding some souls difficult." "So, I assume you cannot go to native american burial grounds either?" "Yes, but many of their deities weren't considered all powerful." [yay!]"So, it just needs to be a powerful otherworldly being pertaining to a specific aspect?" "That seems oddly restrictive." "Is that bad..?" "Is belief the only thing that matters with the deity? Does it need to actually exist?" "So does that mean every god exists?" "They need to hear it." "They need to hear it." *She seems a bit upset about his responses* "And they all have absolute power?" "What about all the ones who control the same thing?" "Sparky, I need to do this! You didn't so now I have to!"*She looks a bit shocked* #TOTENBURG

---

*Trish is walking home late, past the building Archangel is checking out* *Not at the moment, but Archangel might notice that the small girl has a sword strapped to her waist* [alright, one moment!]

*While walking, she stops. She seems to have noticed something. She suddenly turns, looking up at Archangel, looking mildly confused* *She suddenly doesn't looks surprised, she looks mad* "If you actually cared then why didn't you just do what I asked in the first place?!" "How can two people have absolute control over one thing?" [yes, he is annoyed under the helmet] "Rooftop stakeouts? Talk about stealing my shtick." "But if they must compromise, are they really all powerful over that domain?" *It's in his tone too* "Just commenting. So, any particular reason you're pretending to be Batman?" *Well, is she going to respond to him then..?* "Azreal then." "Is something wrong?" "You just told me you didn't even tell Thor!""So, still haven't really answered the question." "There's no reason to lie." "Right, that doesn't sound sketchy at all." "Why not?" "Why'd you do that?" "Hm. I can understand that." *His helmet retracts into his armor and he takes off his visor* "Is that better?" "Hold on, I have an idea." *His armor melts down, turning into a chair and revealing his real form* "Is that better?" *She looks upset at him* "Oh. Compatible how?" "I don't particularly like those stories." "They are inaccurate. Insultingly so." "What..?! And don't change the subject!" "The stories show us as incompetent drunkards." "Incompetent in comparison to our real potential" "My suit is one example." "It is magic and technology. Those are one and the same on my world." "So, what is an elf doing on earth?" #SPITPODS

Also known as 'pods, these floating large plants seem to absorb water vapor in the air and sunlight to stay alive, floating to keep out of harm's way. Basically think a [flying cactus](http://www.supercheats.com/guides/files/guid/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/Peahat.jpg). also, actual details- they never die of old age, they just keep getting bigger and making fruit and dropping it every few weeks until something knocks them down to get all the water inside. They travel to follow the sun and water vapor clouds, sometimes in 'herds'. Some people follow the herds, picking up the fruits and picking off large ones for water and food. #EDEN

One of the most dangerous creatures of the wastes to anyone who doesn't know about it, the Eden looks like a large flower (6" to 12 feet across depending on age) with pools with walls made from green leaf-like substance. The pools are full of what looks like water, and are sometimes covered by green leaves. The liquid is actually a powerful toxin and digestive fluid which smells sweet and has the texture of water. Many people will reach the Eden, drink from the 'water', pass out and die, then be dragged into the pool by slow leaf-like muscles, which then cover the pool while they digest. The reproduce by releasing bursts of seed pods, fired into the air at high speed. #BONGLE 

an oddly-named and odd-looking plant. Above ground it is a straight stalk about 4-6 feet tall with a few leaves and a ball-shaped... thing. at the top. Like a coconut. Under ground they spread roots from which more stalks come up, meaning a whole field may be the same plant. Their... "fruit", tastes terrible and is hard to get open. But it grows quickly, so many people grow it. what do mutants do?"From what?" "Oh..." *He hides it well, but he feels disappointed* *He shrugs* "You choice* "So, will that heal?" oh my! more specifically...? "Depending on what?" "No!" "Because I want you to answer me!""Then they are not unstoppable." i mean what do you mean by being ostracized and such, do they get physical mutations? "Hm. Do whatever your doctors say then." "YES!"spooky!"My name is Brokkr, by the way." "You just said they were stopped. So, they are they "unstoppable except for that one thing that *can* stop them"." "Very well. It was fairly pleasant to meet you, Adna." "Why are you so quiet?" "But can they really be infinite?" "Why?" "Then why were you being greedy?" "What..?" "So? I'm not mad about that." 'Did it...? I'm sorry if it did. I'm just not really sure what's... Normal." "I'm shy?" "I *am* a bit mad about you not telling Thor. And more mad about you hitting me!""I didn't really consider myself as shy." "Sorry about that." "Why'd you hit me though?" "Why?" "So?" "That doesn't mean you have to hit me!" "I don't think so." "Why?" "I'm not sure I understand what you're saying." "They can be stopped. You cannot be unstoppable if you cannot be stopped, you can just be one of the hardest things to stop." "Well, it's up to you." "I don't understand what you mean by that, but I suppose you would understand better." "Stop being stupid!" "Uh... I still need to get my suit from your home." "And thus, stopped." *He is quiet for a second, then his armor reforms and he leaves without a word* "What, seriously?" "well, that sounds stupid dangerous." "Hm... No, I just think it doesn't make much sense." "Why are you doing it at night?" [oh... minor tweaks need to be made then]"Perhaps they just don't like explaining themselves." [oh no, it's just that Trish generally dresses differently depending on if it's day or night][Can't see her sword, it's in a guitar case on her back, also her coat/cape isn't there]*Lilith is ecstatic to see Katie back on her feet, and bounds over, making some rather loud clangs as she walks* "It does make you wonder why they are worshiped sometimes." IC: *Lilith writes GHOSTS*

OOC: Zombies.... I know they would never happen, but they still scare me... [ya, one moment]"Why not just toss a Molotov or two in?" "Still, vampires." *Is she even slightly worried about the fact that a 15 year old just suggested molotovs?* yay!I will do the Tuesday meal if that is okay with everyone![oh yay! I can't wait to see who gets picked!]*Lilith is in the Feral Flares' home area, she smells slightly of alcohol* *Lilith looks over with a confused tilt of her head. She writes a message on a piece of paper and shows it to him, it says HOW..?* *She shakes her head, then writes a message that says I POURED A LOT OF IT OUT**She writes IT SMELLED BAD AND TASTED BAD**She lightly pushes him away, but given her powers a light push is probably rather powerful. She writes a message that says HOW DO I KNOW WHICH STUFF IS CHEAP**She shrugs, she also looks a bit sad now**Lilith quietly, or at least as quietly as a woman with the weight of a car can, walks off to go be alone somewhere*[ooc, Lilith gets sad easily when people she thinks of as her friends are mad at her] [oh yay!][okay!][he looks like he might be too powerful, but other than that looks interesting!][yay! I like gentle characters with a lot of power][I dunno, but some people seem to not for some reason]*Lilith is slowly eating some BLTs, she looks a bit sad*[ooc, Lilith is a strange case. She's probably True neutral or chaotic neutral]

*Lilith thinks for a while, the shrugs, writing a message that says I LIKE FORGIVING PEOPLE**She writes a message PEOPLE ARE MAD AT ME**She writes SOMETHING ABOUT POURING OUT ALCOHOL**She writes REALLY?* *She writes THANK YOU**She goes back to eating**Lilith seems a bit happier**She nods and writes DITTO**She writes a message that says PAYLOAD IS MAD AT ME**She shrugs**She shrugs**She looks confused, then seems to realize something. She writes I DIDN'T MEAN DITTO LIKE THE PERSON DITTO**She writes DITTO LIKE- DITTO? IS THAT A WORD?**She writes I POURED OUT A LOT OF ALCOHOL**She shrugs*[ooc, it actually is a word that basically just means "same". when Katie said "Heyy, if someone ever picks on you, just let me know." Lilith said 'ditto' as in 'same to you']

*Lilith looks confused now**She writes HE SOUNDED MAD**She writes I ALSO MIGHT HAVE BROKEN ONE OF HIS BONES AGAIN ON ACCIDENT**HE SEEMS TO BE MAD AT KATIE NOW TOO**Lilith nods happily*

[it's okay!]*She writes hurriedly I DO NOT WANT TO START FIGHTS**She tilts her head, looking confused now**She writes GERMAIN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TEACHING PAYLOAD**She shrugs, it seems she's just going to leave him to hsi own devices with that*[oh my! that sounds like it might go bad]*She waves goodbye*[yep!][indeed, it will go bad but also will be fun!][well, Carry has lost literally every single worldly possession in a single move, so I'm not quite sure what to do][I'm somehow not sure if she can win with every single power other than one that only works in water and one that knocks her out in a few seconds gone. I will try to think of something to do though]*Carry looks, above all else, thoroughly angered. Unlike her usual manner of looking like a bit of a layabout slob, she is fairly well-dressed in a plain sundress and is in her most mature form. Both of these facts bring a great deal of attention to the bandaged stump that was once her arm. She is currently sitting and tapping her foot, mumbling curses in various languages under her breath*"It's not locked." *She says, her accent and anger making it sound almost more like a growl*"Eep!" *She is rather surprised by the demon* "Please I have been in terrible places and am missing an arm I am not good for eating!"*She tilts her head inquisitively**Carry's cursing grows louder for a moment, but then she takes a deep breath and seems to compose herself a bit. She ceases her foot tapping and and her cursing, crossing her legs and looking at him with eyes that still look like they're shooting daggers. Her whole pose seems a bit off due to her unfamiliarity with her new weight distribution* "It's... Alright. We signed up for danger."*She nods but writes PLEASE DO NOT HURT HIM**She nods, and reaches out to hug Katie**Lilith then nods and gets back to her meal**She writes YOU TOO**Lilith seems rather unwilling or incapable of eating her own meal, and instead is feasting herself on bread and butter. Lots of butter.*"Oh, so you are not her for eating me? That is better then." *She seems to calm down a fair bit*"It is not technically you who should be sorry. I would have liked to know about the dinosaurs ahead of time though.""All that happened after I passed out? People really should tell me these things.""Do you know why they were there? They were rather pretty when they weren't trying to be eating me. Or Succeeding in eating me.""So... Will the dinosaurs still be there with the artifact gone then?""Shoot, I was hoping to make a park..." *She says with a small pout*"Ice caps? I have a question, do you have any sewing machines?""Peter is dead?! Wait, which one was Peter again..?""Oh! I didn't really speak to him much, I was mostly bleeding on the floor when that happened.""Well, I am not dead."*She thinks, then says* "I am mad at a lot of people at the moment, but you are not too high on the list.""Stop with the apologizing, there's nothing you could have done to change it and I am not dead yet.""Really? I didn't look that much different. I think.""Oh, that wasn't my dragon onesie."*She pouts a bit* "Well, in my current state I can't exactly do it by hand. Do you think you could get one here quickly?""Good. Could you also get me large amounts of fabric?"[oh! and I sent something in modmail!]"To me?""I fell into the water, it wasn't really much of a fight.""I won't need too much, I just need to make a couple adjustments. Do you have any idea how long until the next flight?""And how long will the flight be?""Huh? Why?""I can work with this probably, I will decide whether to go later, in the meantime I have sowing to do."*She goes to bother people, the cogs in her little surprisingly cruel head already turning.*"I still have two of them!" *She says indignantly* "And what other option do I have?""And what if you don't win?"[question! would you be alright with an interaction with Carry once he leaves this little meeting with Derek?]"You can't guarantee that!""And what if you don't succeed? Then I'll be a girl with one arm and nothing else""Hide behind someone obviously, or use the dragon if I have to!""I always make it a point to let other people do work for me!" *She says with a happy smile*"Alright!"*She accepts it, though seems mildly annoyed at being reminded of her current predicament* "I think I can find my own solution to that.""I'm not just an ordinary adorable beautiful genius little girl you know, magic is something else I am amazing at." *She says with a cocky smile*"Probably! It is a complicated thing to do that kind of stuff though!""Most things are being handled already, I just wish I had more time available.""Water would be nice, and sweets.""Hm?" *She looks over at him, her mild interest softening the anger in her features slightly**Lilith, who had been wearing her coat and hat to hide her identity, lets out an annoyed growl. She walks into a nearby store, cleanly folding and placing down her disguise, then walks outside and rips a stopsign out of the ground, holding it like a club*"My limb? That is an inconvenience. The real problem is my bag." *She says in her usual obscure accent*"Yes. The one with everything I owned in it.""I am still deciding, I do wish we had more time until the next expedition.""I don't really smoke."I can't really think of a voice actress for Carry, partially due to her accent and partially due to her constantly shifting age!

---

Hati's voice also changes depending on mood and such

---

Trish sounds kind of like [Kimberly Brooks as Bat-girl](https://youtu.be/ls8GLxcqoMM?t=1m35s), but higher pitched since she is still going through puberty

---

Skoll sounds kind of like the comparatively lighter and higher voices done by [Patrick Seitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJyKMBW5ajc) (like Lucian), without his mask his voice is less impossing.

---

Bernard sounds like Santa Claus!

---

Akki sounds [kind of like tsubaki](https://youtu.be/vK3SApJHNFM?t=2m20s) despite her imposing figure. 

---

Dolly sounds kind of like [velma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q76evm7Qtws), sass included given her current mood after moving. "Thank you."ic: *Lilith writes on her notepad KATJA*

ooc: I'm not entirely sure, I guess a mix of various "gentle giant" characters!*Luckily, the figure, who is now quickly recovering, was apparently Lilith. She has a stop sign in one hand, holding it like a club, and seems to not be too phased by the nearby explosion. She gives a friendly wave**She covers her ears, she seems to not like loud noises. She looks over at him and tilts her head, suddenly tossing the sign like a javelin at a sand golem behind Payload**She nods, pulling up a new street sign and slamming a charging boar in the side of the head hard enough to practically disintegrate it**She tilts her head inquisitively as she slams the head entirely off of a sand golem**Lilith walks past, gnawing on what looks like a ham bone. She stops and turns to look at him, she tends to like meeting new people**She looks a bit upset at that and grumbles a bit, casually splatting another boar to her side**She tilts her head and waves, pulling her mask back down over her mouth**She shakes her head as she grabs a boar by the back leg and swings it into a golem, destroying both of them**She seems happy with the mallet, and quickly uses it to smack a boar hard enough to send it careening into one of its allies**Just before she leaves, she turns back and says* "Oh! One last question, what do we do if someone different brings back the next artifact? Who gets the reward?"*She looks around for somewhere to put her bone, before settling on holding the chewed remains of it in her mouth. She takes out a pad of paper and a chunky pencil and writes HI on it**One of the boars charges behind her, ramming into her leg. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to have done much other than alert Lilith to its presence, leading to another splattered boar**She shrugs as she brings one of her fists right through a golem's face**In the meantime, she continues her scheming* *She points to a nametag on her prison-style shirt which says LILITH*"What if Alex doesn't make it back, will the person who gets the next one get the reward?"*She seems happy to hear this, and gives him a thumbs up. Behind her a sand golem is charging, rearing back to punch*[indeed! she is schemeing on her own for the moment]*She tilts her head inquisitively as she crushes a struggling golem's skull in a headlock**She goes to accept the handshake, her grip feels remarkably strong, but it is obvious she is restraining herself enough to not harm him* *She jumps a bit in surprise and turns around, seeing the pile of sand*"Frankly this death and gloom is getting very tiring. I just want a nice cup of cocoa and a warm bed. Also an arm, but that's on a different priority list." *Right below 'terrible wonderful painful revenging' she thinks to herself**She looks a bit intrigued as she slams two boars together**She looks surprised and sprints over**She returns the thumbs up as she grabs a golem into a headlock and crushes it**She takes some time to take out her notepad and write YOU TOO**She nods, happily obliging**Carry looks rather different from how she usually does, she is fairly well-dressed in a plain sundress and is in her most mature form. Both of these facts bring a great deal of attention to the bandaged stump that was once her arm. She is working on a sewing machine, she seems to be modifying one of her two remaining suits**She jumps in surprise after that explosion, and covers her ears**She nods*"Hm? Oh, Of course you don't recognize me. I would change but I think my bandages would fall off." *She says, her accent still being a dead givaway.*"The thing in the water, I think you were there for that actually.""Goodbye!"

[question ooc, would you be alright with her using the time between then and now to modify one of her two suits into something not completely useless?]*She puts her hand up to her ear, trying to hear him better, that seems to have messed with her hearing a bit**She shakes her head**She puts down the club, and begins unwinding the coiled weighted chains on her wrists*"Fair point.""How do you mean so?" *She says, cocking an eyebrow with interest*"You want to stay as a tenant in the luxurious Cambell family castle?"hail to aberion, the hammer of dawn! yay!"You will have to be careful not to touch my things if you do!"*She begins spinning the chains, the hefty weights at the ends of them becoming terrifying weapons*I've only played a bit on my brother's account, but it is fun!"I mean my room.""I think that might have been in the bag actually.""Yes, I lost almost all of them..."[well, I had two potential ideas. One is modifying the orca one to let her move normally on land, the downside being that destabilizing it like that will remove its ability to let her command orcas and also make it break down completely in a couple days, the other is permenantly modifying the dragon one to limit its stats but let her stay in it without passing out, that process would be effectively irreversible since fixing it or making a new dragon suit from scratch would take years]"I don't need pelts, I can work on them on my own when I have free time. Please get a sewing machine for impaired peoples though."IC: *Lilith shrugs*

OOC: I would think Black Paladin, simply because he literally works for the devil[it is an acronym that stands for Son Of a B-word I do not want to say!][oh! I probably should have explained that in context. a "Hardcore SOB" doesn't necessarily mean someone mean or cruel, it means someone tough and scary and often rather extreme in their actions.]*Lilith, wearing her full disguise of coat, hat, and gloves, steps into the deck to get some fresh air**Each weight is now spinning with enough force tor am right through the head of a golem without slowing**She eventually seems to grow bored after clearing out a majority of the golems in the immediate area**With most of the golems in the area dealt with, she begins shaping the sand into a little hill**A fairly loud thumping noise can be heard coming closer**Lilith is walking towards the room, sniffing the air a bit*"Yes, I apologize if I looks a bit different." *She seems surprisingly composed for someone who recently lost her arm**Lilith tilts her head, squatting down to get a closer look at the kitty**She takes out her notepad and writes MAKING A SAND CASTLE**With her mask in the way it likely just licks the mask, but she seems happy with it. She gingerly reaches out towards it**Lilith jumps and falls back in surprise, scrambling back a bit herself**Lilith stares back, and then waves**She lightly pokes the cat**She does her best to pet the kitty's belly gently.**She waves to him again with her other hand**She is unwilling to move the kitten from its current resting place, so she can't really move much**She takes out a pad of paper from her pocket and begins writing, she writes HI**She smiles and eats her own meal happily**She nods happily at that too**She seems a bit surprised, but hugs back.**She is currently crunching a bone apart**She pats Otto on the head**She looks over at him and smiles back, given that she's been eating her mask is pulled up for once, making the smile visible.*IC: *Lilith says nothing, but secretly thinks- ["when nobody is on the ship and I am here alone, I secretly eat all the jelly. I am very naughty."](http://i.imgur.com/twbGFfy.gif)*

OOC: I do not really think I would like to answer that*Hati happens to be rather cheerily walking down the street, in her more modern silver armor. She is the very picture of dignified grace, that is other than the rather badly beaten costumed criminal she is dragging behind her*"Hm?" *She looks over in Thor's direction, her smile growing wider* "Thor!" *She drops the criminal and runs to tacklehug Thor*"You too!" *She hugs tightly, she's practically like an excitable puppy*"Not really sure, but he was robbing a store.""Yay! Thank you!""Sure! What is it?""Sure! I'd love to see that place!"

[this can actually potentially lead to some very bad things if anyone finds out who/what Hati is]"What do you mean?""Well, can't you tell them the truth? Or are they weird about that kind of thing?""Oh! Of course I am!" *She hugs her again*"Yep! We can talk on the way too!"*Hati skips along with her, totally forgetting the criminal unconscious and bloody in the street**She happily does so, she seems giddy as a schoolgirl*"Yes!" *She leans her head on Thor's shoulder, instantly changing to the perfect height to do so*[okay! how would you like to start?]"You are going to get us all killed, imbecile!"*She then nods, and writes something MAY I SEE YOUR HANDS?**She isn't knocked back much, but she does pet his head*"Why wouldn't I be?""Well, I could list some of them!"*She waves hello as she passes*"The weather is pretty, the clouds look fun, there's wind, you smell good, I had a cheeseburger recently-" *She continues to list of random things, including random compliments*"No I mean how have you not dies of starvation or something? You strike me as the kind of guy that, if your fridge was empty, you would yell at it until it filled itself.""Oh! We're here already!""Hm? What is it, sparky?""This isn't a matter of people skills this is a matter of pure stubbornness."*She mulls it over for a while, then shrugs. As she mulls it over, multiple memories of other people's words come up, something about density.*[okay! as a note, Lilith is going to probably see them coming from a metaphorical mile away due to her enhanced senses]"I do that all the time!""Try to do it! Or ask somebody to help me do it! Or sometimes I forget what I was doing!""But it's not the most useful skill in all situations. Some things don't get solved through stubbornness." "I have no idea how to make hammers!" *She says cheerily* "I can help name one though!""Nah, that doesn't always help either. Like the aforementioned food situation, the fridge isn't going to give you food if you shoot it either.""Name it spinsmasher!""But it has the spinny hilt!" *She says, pointing to the double helix handle*"Which at least means you did something indirect, even if it was amoral and illegal."*Dolly is hanging out on a rooftop in Millennium, happy to have some piece and quiet for once*"But it doesn't have a tiger on it!"[question! will there be a recruiting event or something?]*She looks confused by the name*"Why didn't you say that in the first place?"*She sniffs his nails, sniffing for the smell of the blood of whoever he fought*"Well, use easier words next time."*She uses her other hand to pet the kitten**Trish, covered in a couple blood splatters and looking exhausted herself, wanders into the alley and sits down against the opposite wall a couple feet down* "You mind if I join you?" *She says somewhat sarcastically*"Hm?" *She swings the man haphazardly out of the way* "What was that for?""Sure!" *She drops the man and begins walking to the nearest purveyor of good food**She goes to a bakery**It's a bit expensive**She practically cries with joy as she is handed the slice of cake, and immediately swallows the entire thing**"HM?"*"THIS IS TOO MUCH OF THE COLD!" *She hides behind other people on the bus, using them as meatshields**She nods*"You want to get something?""Oh! Why'd you get it then?""Okay! Thank you sparky!" *She suddenly hugs him, still in her armor**She then lets him go finally*"Not much!" *She begins listing off a list of inane tasks she has been doing, after a few minutes of droning on she says* "Oh ya, and I started dating Thor! Nothing else springs to mind.""Thank you! You should meet her sometime!""And?"*She looks confused. He should probably remember who he is talking to before insisting Thor arrests vigilantes.*"I still don't get why you can't meet Thor.""Exactly!""Yay! You can meet her later!""Okay, bye-bye!" *She begins walking out*"Hm? Sure!""Wanna do it right now?""Let's go!" *She grabs him by the shirt and begins skipping away happily**She drags him all the way up to a rooftop*"Alright! How do you fight now?""So, you're just going to start avoiding the point now?""Alright! Let's try hand to hand!" *She suddenly gets boxing gloves**She pays no attention to that, and simply smacks him in the face at high speed*"Oh! Didn't you see that coming?" "No, it really doesn't. Especially not in this case.""Well, try harder next time!""Okay sparky!""I'm not really sure if that was even a response to what I just said."*It doesn't seem to phase her much*"Was that it?""Oh! Sorry about that! I should change into brawling attire." *Her outfit switches to her normal one, plus the boxing gloves*"O-kay, now that we've established you're not listening to me, I'm probably just going to get something to read."*She swings her legs at his, trying to trip him**Her kick seems to be too fast*"Come on Sparky, try harder!""Alright, so you're also now rambling." *He begins to wander off a bit further into the library*"If someone is too strong, fight harder!""Yay!" *She grabs and throws him**He takes out his cellphone once he's out of earshot* "[hello, police?](http://i.imgur.com/r1gHnj3.png) Ya, someone is making a public disturbance at the local library and threatening the librarian- No, I don't know if he has a weapon, but he talked about owning guns- five minutes? Thanks.""Oh! Are you alright Sparky?""What's wrong?"*She happily skips over and picks him up to place him back on the roof*"Well ya, that why it's just training!""Now, try to block!" *She swings again, but this time seems to do so in slow motion.**He stays fairly far off from him, but still in the library*"Good! Again!" *She does a similar punch, slightly faster this time**She continues at this speed for a while with various different attacks**Lilith looks up, sniffing the air, and growling.*

[I link in /u/notjamesgracie now, right? or do I have the order wrong?]"What's wrong with your legs?"
"Still? Heal faster!""It is!"*Simon rolls his eyes* "Well, at least he'll be leaving the librarian alone now.""I can't do it, you have to!""Then try harder!""There is no explanation! You just do it! Don't give up, that's how you don't do it!"[indeed, unless he's going to do something else obvious and suspicious] "Yay!" *She continues, faster this time.*[okay, end then!]*This successfully gets her to ease up on those attacks, making them easier to deal with. In all honesty she could probably take the attacks easily, she's just letting him feel better*[okay!]"Not yet. So, you fighting assholes in this city too or did  you just wrestle a bulldozer?""Whoa!" *She looks more than a bit surprised*"Time flies sometimes, doesn't it?"*She in fact cannot see a thing as she hides and swears in various languages*"Uh... Hi." *She doesn't seem to know what to say to the flying drink mascot*"I'm gonna make a wild guess and say she doesn't approve of this stuff?"*Hati walks in, immediately faceplanting onto the couch*"What's that supposed to mean, everybody needs to kick back once in a while.""Are you... An actual flying drink mascot?""No, I just like your couch!"[oh, sorry, I misread his last comment, one moment while I change mine!]"It's soft.""Are you really an alien..?""Then why aren't you?""Where are the other Durinko men then? or Durinko women? or some other one if your race has more genders.""Well you said we're going to your home, right?""Mind if I ask something a bit personal?""So why are you here?""Oh! Let's eat then! Or talk! Or watch things! Or do each other's hair and nails! Or run around in circles!""You really care about her? Like, long-term relationship, not as a fuckbuddy or anything.""Did the rest of them not want one?""Then don't take so many risks.""Yay! I vote cartoons!""If you did you wouldn't take as many risks, because for all you know one day she might be waiting for you to come home to show you a certain test with two red lines on it and she's going to be waiting a long time." *Trish sighs, stretching a bit* "Name's Trish by the way, sorry if I'm a bit of a stick-in-the-mud bitch. Well, not really sorry but it's nice to say I am.""Why? Is earth just far away or is it considered boring?"*Hati seems very happy to watch superhero cartoons.*"Nice to meet you. Mind making sure nobody stabs me for a bit?" *She says, sitting cross-legged as her hair and eyes begin to turn white and a light blue aura forms around her*"By how much?"*Hati happily snuggles as she watches**She doesn't respond. It looks like she might be doing some kind of meditating.*"Rough estimate?""Ya!" *She might be referring to the cartoon, it's hard to tell with her**As she meditates the light glow turns into some kind of blue aura around her, and rather amusingly forms two small cat-ear shapes on her head*"Wow, you guys have some advanced tech."*Hati likes the blanket, and also heats up a bit, acting like a living heater**These are shortly joined by a tail-like shape of light lightly whipping back and forth as she rests, but after a minute or so it all dissipates and her hair and eyes return to normal. She lets out a loud yawn**Hati seem particularly engrossed in the current scene of the cartoon, and doesn't seem to notice*"How come you haven't given earth any of it?""Ya, why wouldn't I be?""Ya?""Wait, how did you get here then..?""Meditation, really really advanced meditation. It's an old trick my mom taught me, she says she learned it from my dad.""Oh! Sorry about that!" *Her outfit turns into silver-colored silk pajamas*"Oh. How come he didn't stay?""Focused my conscious mind's processing power on optimizing my healing and recovery."*Snuggles! Hati seems happy, and also is cheering on the characters in the cartoon*"Fair enough. How long did it take to fly here?""I would teach you if it weren't for the fact that it would take forever and also my mom would probably kill me if I did.""Do you ever intend to go back..?""This is nice, it's comfy and warm and there's cartoons.""I'm guessing you've got a trick or two of your own if you're fighting out here. Or just really skilled, like BJ.""Yep! That's part of 'comfy' and 'warm' in the equation!"*She is quiet for a bit, missing her home* "Why not..?""You know, Blackjacket. Or are you new or something?""You too, normal pillows don't say nice things to me!" *She says, her tone semi-joking*[okay!]"But it's your home...""I call people a lot of stupid things. Also... Sorry." *She sounds sincere this time*"Ya, I'm just bad at listing things."*She is quiet for a while, but then has a small smile**She sniffs, memorizing the scent, and then starts sniffing the air around her to look for it**She seems happy with all the purring**Lilith is currently looking right at where Ditto is and growling as she picks up a large log she was playing with earlier.*

/u/notjamesgracie turn!

/u/Acciosun

/u/Zorrekky *Lilith looks at the broadcasts, looking more confused than anything else.*"It's nothing, just... Maybe something I needed to hear a bit."*Hati loves tight hugs!*"Need any help?"[ooc, what was he put in the brig for?]*Lilith tries some of the food, and seems overwhelmed. Not disgusted, just overwhelmed by how strong the flavor is*[oh! oh my!][I know, but still! scary.]yay! shipping!"That was great! What do you wanna do now?""So, do you really carry around cans of soda?"*She walks over and offers said hand**She nods, her face scrunched up under her mask*[indeed, it is very good drama! Still spooky though. Perfect for halloween! oh! we should do a halloween event thing!]*She helps pull him up* "You got any wounds that need patched up, or just tired?""Oh. Is it because of the taste?" *She doesn't ask for one*"Uuuuuum" *She looks at the clock, and seems to be trying to figure it out* "Um... three... five?" *It is actually one fifteen, she got the hands mixed up*"Fair enough.""Go back to your girlfriend, take the scolding like a man, then do whatever she says. It'll probably involving resting."[question! is it common knowledge that she survived or are they hiding her somewhere?]*She happily drinks the milk, then nods*"Yay! Food!""Good." *She doesn't sound scolding or mocking when she says it, for once in her life Trish just sounds sincere. She turns to walk out of the alley* "Uh..." *She holds up her wings, showing her lack of hands*[okay! I have an idea for something Lilith can do when that happens. Do you happen to know if Wraith smells any different due to being dead? Not rotting necessarily, but general different smells.]*She looks happy, but eats it quickly. She seems to have quite an appetite.* "Like what?""Oh! Yay!" *She looks at it with a smile*"Hopefully." *Before she leaves the alley, she stops and says something* "That girl... Mind telling me her name?""Something sweet!"*Hati turns to her and waves happily, totally forgetting the criminal she was dragging*"Cool. Try not to get killed, but if you do I promise I'll help her.""I usually don't really. The best I have to work with is these." *She shows the two tiny thumb-like claws on her wings**She looks ecstatic, and feasts.*"Thank you!" *In the meantime she begins wandering around*[oh! okay then.][that makes sense! I feel like her scent might get a bit obvious if she goes too long without bathing, not because she would smell bad but because she probably *wouldn't*. If being dead stops her from sweating (which I don't know if it does) then she could go very long amounts of time without washing without smelling bad]"Hello!""No prob." *She keeps walking*"Mhm."*At the moment Hati is playing with furniture*"Hm?""Did you draw this pretty picture?"[it would be sad if he died, but then Trish would also get to act like an aunt/godmother kind of thing]"Yay! Thank you!" *She runs over to tacklehug her*"Oh!" *She quickly runs to the table*"It's alright.""Really? Can I see them?" *She doesn't relinquish the hug*"Yay!"*This, however, she does not like. She suddenly kicks, nearly too fast to see, at the hammer**She looks back and shrugs**She shakes her head*"Hm?""Oh ya! Somebody will probably get him."*Hati hums and skips along with her*"Fancy!""You made all this stuff?"*She rushes, catching it*"Pretty!" *She is investigating many things very quickly* [no, it's okay! Hati probably won't remember it anyway]

*She is dealing with some rather fragile things...**She catches him as well, putting him down on the roof*there probably would have been less homicidal ways to do it, but that still works!"Well... You got a big straw?""What was what for?""Sure!" *She puts the object back down in the wrong place*"Yaaaaaay!" *She runs over to look at it**Nothing in particular, she's just looking for ones that catch her eye*[loki is doing shenanigans?]"You tried to hit me with it!""Oh! Why's Loki fighting people?""We were starting with blocking!""That could work for now.""Do you have more pictures of Loki?""Yay!" *She begins looking through them**She takes the straw in her mouth rather than using her claws and likely dropping it*"I dunno, but if you can't block then you won't get to attack anyway."[would that include things that could have happened but did not?]

*She is happily looking through the ones from the Niflheimr adventure*[did you drop this..?][I meant she took it with her mouth because *if* she used her claws she would drop it]"Ya!" *She goes to a picture of Loki, with her standing next to him wearing a collar and looking proud*"Kinky?" *She looks confused at the picture, she doesn't seem to recognize it*"Thank you!" *Hati investigates what it is and, regardless of the answer, eats it.*[it's okay!]*She drinks refreshing Durinko**She shrugs**Hati loves waffles**She nods**Hati finishes her own waffles very quickly, and drinks some syrup and milk to wash them down**She finishes fairly quickly* "Thanks, I normally don't get to drink soda.""As in me trying to hit you one more time?"*Trish, similarly, is out beating up thugs for info**Bernard shows up to one of Hjalmar's talks to listen to his old friend**Simon Serafim has managed to land a nice job doing general cleaning work backstage at Jennifer's show, given his past experience with jobs it probably will be a short-lived one, but it pays the bills for now.*"Yep. The carbonation felt a little weird thou-" *She hiccups*"Start from where?" *She seems confused now**She nods**If she does it will probably be while she's beating someone senseless or dangling them off of something high up**Bernard likes talks like this.**He nods and smiles in greeting as she passes*"I think so..?"*She hugs back very tightly**Bernard goes to greet his friend* "Hjalmar, it has been too long my friend." *Many people are probably weirded out by how huge and terrifying Bernard is*"Hm?" *She says, looking over at him and away from the thug whose head is currently under her sneaker*"Does that happen a lot with these drinks?""Huh..?" *She looks confused now*"So, think the show'll go well?""Absolutely!""I am sorry I have been busy lately, I ended up as groundskeeper at a school for mages and it takes up a surprising amount of time.""No offense, but does it look like I need help?" *She asks, offhandedly backhanding a thug trying to sneak up behind her*"That... Could take getting used to.""Well, I'm sure you'll do great out there." *He gives a sincere smile*"Oh! I am sorry if I haven't been around enough"*She keeps looking, finding a picture of Loki watching as she mauls someone.*"The hiccups, I mean.""Surprisingly not, aside from the occasional fire or curse the place is amazingly tame. No prophecies and the like.""Well, there's your answer."*He goes back to cleaning, he seems a generally sincere and happy person*"Alright! I still want to show up more often though.""You know any- hic -cures for them?"*She kicks another one down, turning to the last thug* "Now, again, info. Now.""Bah, too boring.""It is?"*He finishes most of his cleaning work early*

[mind if some NPC human villain/villains show up?]"I am?" *She looks touched*"Aw-hic-ww...""I-I really don't know!" *The large man is crying. It's kind of pathetic. Trish looks disgusted and annoyed*"Have you been up to anything exciting, or just speeches?"[generic crazy fashionista with human stats and bombs rigged to blow around the place if they don't declare him the greatest fashionista in the world?]"Why?""It's alright.""Thank you! But you're the best!""You wanna try?""We should find a little adventure for ourselves at some point."[okay! would/could that include boobytrapping some of the outfits?][oh yay!]"Do you paint things you don't remember a lot?""So... Hitting you again?"*Lilith is still growling in Ditto's general direction, when the wind suddenly shifts direction a bit- putting her downwind of Ichor. She stops, sniffs the air a bit, then roars and tosses the log in her hand at the tree he is in*

/u/AccioSun 

/u/notjamesgracie

/u/Zorrekky"Good point!""Why?"*Her loud stomps and growling can be heard as she comes down the hall before she enters the room.*"Oh! Maybe that's why I forget things all the time too!"*She pats him on the head and holds out another hunk of meat*"Okay!" *She aims a much higher-speed kick at his side*"Wait I'm crazy?" *She seems confused now*"But it's fun!""You should try it!""Oh! What are those for?""You did better that time!""Do a lot of people want to steal these things?""But you have a bunch that didn't happen too!""I thought you said just one more?""This is confusing.""Huh? Of course not!"*She looks very confused, and her head is steaming a bit*[oh! indeed it is! sorry, I messed up the order!]

/u/notjamesgracie it is your turn a bit above here!"O-kaaaaaay!"*She suddenly has a comically large mallet in her hands, and swings it at him*[wait, I thought that everyone thought Wraith was dead...?]"Hm?" *He succeeds in doing so*[oh! okay!][oh! okay!]*He successfully rolls out of the way*"Yay!" *She suddenly has a large puffy baseball bat in her hands, which she swings**It connects with his stomach, it may be padded but it's still pretty harmful*[okay! back to the thing!]

*Suddenly, in the middle of the show, a [very oddly dressed man](http://fashionovert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Popular-Crazy-Mens-Fashion-with-Images-of-Crazy-Fashion-Collection-New-at-Galleries.jpg) runs to the stage, holding what looks like a detonator of some kind in his hands*

"Attention, you disgusting fools!" *He says, he sounds like he's on the verge of tears for some reason* "You have for too long disgraced the BEAUTY that is FASHION! I will stand for this NO LONGER! This building has detonation charges on all of its supports, and I have wired a small charge into all of your so-called 'outfits' that will go off if you attempt to remove them! You all have ONE HOUR to declare me, LA FASHIONEPHALIM, the greatest fashionista to ever live and secure me the means to leave here with all your money, or you will all burn in the name of FASHION" *He is fairly obviously completely insane, but appears to have told the truth about the bombs*"Hopefully it wouldn't be the kind they make into a children's tale." *He says with a laugh**She pouts*"Alright, he's probably too stupid to know what I need anyway." *She gives the thug a kick to the gut and walks further down the alley*"Anyway, I gotta get home, it was nice meeting you.""Oh! Are you alright?"*She bursts into the room, they probably would have seen her around the ship at some point**She looks happy, and gets more food for herself again*"It is..?"*She waits, looking bored**She dives off and takes wing, flying off* 

[end?]"Well, you know what I meant.""I said *you're* the best! I meant it!"*Simon hears this from backstage* "That's... Different.""I didn't realize it was weird!""OF COURSE REALLY!" *The man on stage yells* "THIS IS FASHION!"

*Meanwhile, Simon is looking for a fairly secluded place*"Can we both be the best?""Yay! I'm impressive!""So, do you have enough free time to get, pardon my language, shit-faced drunk?""Woo, not like I figured that out already." *She says sarcastically*"I'm a meta?""I have no idea if it is True!" *She says happily*"I am a Hati!""Why would I?""I'm curious about important things!""Things like "Why is the sky blue" and "why do ducks get mad when I yell at them"!""Okay!""Why would you?""Then people will correct me later!"*She watches her draw*"Oh! Alrighty!" *She goes back, but can barely sit still*"Sometimes!"*She shrugs**She looks at him and growls**She smiles*"Yay!""Pretty!""Oh! Should I hit you again then?""Oh! Thank you! Is it one of the magic paintings?"*She tilts her head inquisitively*"That's okay!""It looks great!""Make what quick?""O-kaaaay!""Are we there yet?"*She begins to skip out*"Ha! Let's get to it then!""I stopped when I realized it, which was around when you wanted to interrogate him.""Yay!""WHAAAAAAT?!?! YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!" *He looks to her, detonator in his hand.*

*Meanwhile, Simon finds a nice hiding spot and slips the mask of Skoll out of his jacket, putting it on. In seconds, he changes into Skoll, currently wearing a white motorcycle helmet and white suit. He uses the noise from the argument to cover him making a weapon**Lilith does not care where food comes from, she just eats. And loves it.**Big hug!**Lilith is feasting nearby, and looks at him, looking a bit confused*[we can end it here, assuming they went on a drunken general romp]"You seemed to really wanna do it, didn't want to hurt your feelings." *She sounds mildly patronizing*"ABSOLUUUUUTELY DISGUSTING!" *His face twists in disgust* "AND WHAT EVEN IS THAT RAG YOU CALL AN OUTFIT?! WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ME?!?!?"

*Skoll makes his way nearby quietly, holding a bladed boomerang infused with fire**Extremely happy kiss!*[okay! I like their friendship, it is simple and nice.]IC: *Lilith shrugs*

OOC: not many people outside my family!"Well, thanks."*Hati is too happy to speak at the moment, and little hearts are floating in the air around her**She points to her eye and tilts her head inquisitively**He gasps* "THAT IS IT! I WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF YOU, WENCH!" *Just as he is about to press the detonator, Skoll's boomerang flies out from his hiding place offstage, slicing la fashionephalim's hand off and cauterizing the wound in a moment. LF looks too shocked to react as Skoll casually strides on stage* "Sorry I took so long, traffic was hell." *He says with a slightly joking tone*[we should have them go on a silly adventure some time!]*She only manages incoherent mumbling while hugging Thor**She looks shocked and worried*"Need a hand there?" *He says, grinning under his mask at his own bad pun. Meanwhile, he holds his hands together, forming a new weapon as the boomerang dissipates*"Any particular reason you'r running around interrogating people too?"*She shrugs, she doesn't seem to remember a full three seconds ago well right now**She actually looks impressed**Ya, he's knocked out.* "So, want me to help disarm those?""Boring, but admirable."*Trish, on her own bike, drives past Ashley at high speed**She does not look intent on letting go*"Something a bit more personal.""Alright, this shouldn't be too hard." *He says as a small weighted glove appears around his hand, frost quickly forming on it* "Any idea where it is? If not we could just wake him back up or you could feel around for it. Might want to be careful not to set it off though."*Trish notices Ash's acceleration. She hadn't intended to challenge her, but she wasn't
