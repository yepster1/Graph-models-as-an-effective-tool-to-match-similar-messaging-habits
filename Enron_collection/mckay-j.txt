 Scott,  I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.  Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920) Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007) Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960) Encal			C$(14,574,960)   Howard Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.  Regards,  Jon

 The rest should show up by Fedex tomorrow.  Regards,  Jon 
 Lucy,  Almost all basis in Canada is quoted in USD, normal convention is to quote the fixed price in CAD.  I will get Ian Cooke to send you the historical basis for AECO (in USD).  If you want a currency curve to work the numbers back into Canadian dollars we can also get you that, but I'm not sure what that would tell you.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Jon  Ian - could you please forward our historical AECO curve to Lucy  - Thanks

 Dawn,  It looks like Jason Garvey's last day is the August 17th.  Is there anything I need to do to make sure his departure is smooth from a HR stand point?   Jon 
 Todd,  Your welcome to come by at your convience, just give me a call to make sure I'm home.  I usually get home from work around 7:30pm.  I can be reached at 249-8322, and if your coming by my address is 4712 Grove Hill Rd. SW.  (This is just off 17th Avenue and 45th Street SW.)  Regards,  Jon 
 One of my flat screens will not reset and there is an unacceptable amount of static coming through.  Does anyone know of any tricks to fix this problem.  (Yes, I tried turning it off and back on again.)  Regards,  Jon 
 Hey Stephen,  Glad to hear the funds finally showed up.  It would be helpful to me if we could hook back up together in the next little while.  I'd like to get your opinion on a few different thoughts that I've had.  I need to do some "financial planning" so to speak.  Let me know how your schedule is looking  Thanks,  Jon 
 Thanks Des! 
 Kate,  Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.  Given their load profile we would be offered at 4.39/gj for supply one year out of August.  Please let me know if you need any thing else.  Best Regards,  Jon 
 We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.  Regards,  Jon 
 The current offer for these volumes 1 Year out of Oct. would be $4.615.  I hope this helps.  Jon 
 Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one),  How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?  Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.  My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?  Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.  Email me with the info. and I'll give you a call.  Love  Jon 
  Who is taking care of you? 
 David,  Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.  Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?  I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.  Let me know if I can do anything to help.  Regards,  Jon 
  Please take care of this.  Didn't we already send her the data for July?  Jon 
 Please approve  Thanks,  Jon 
 Hello,  Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a cha= nge'n with my life.  First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I d= rove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't t= hat bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You woul= d have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It = kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture,= and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com. = Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some = pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t= he traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from= New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do th= is drive?"  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She re= nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http:= //astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She too= k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thi= ng is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. T= he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro= up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo= w.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the= Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same bu= siness but none-the-less for the same company.  Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin= g to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mer= e coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really= want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part= , I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my hou= se anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have n= o problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiat= ion is in the lead as it stands.  Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me= borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV sta= nd, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store= the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for = the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in H= ouston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take = is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furni= ture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other = things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk ab= out what is best.  Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the s= ame), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself fo= r trying!  Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.  Love,  Jon =20 
 Martin  How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you = and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relat= ing to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I thin= k it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to= handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved. = Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to = the cuts and what we can and can not do.  This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is = anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.  Thanks,  Jon=20 
 Greg,  Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipel= ine declared as its force majure volume?  Jon McKay Unemployed phone: 403-974-6733 jonathan.mckay@enron.com

 Hi Rod,  I am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what I am being told as far as selecting a realtor (see below).  Today I am going to talk to the relocation people and do what I can about keeping things going with you.  The relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on, as demonstrated by their reference to "favorable tax treatment", but if they insist on having Royal LePage I wanted to see if you could speak to them directly.  My preference is to have you represent me, but if they are "paying the bills" I may have little choice.  Best Regards,  Jon

 Mark,  Do you remember this agreement?  I think I told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and I was wondering if this was done, and if I should follow up with him?  They certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this.  Please direct me as to what I should be doing   Regards,  Jon   PS. When you comin' back?

 this person does not report to me. 
 Jay,  The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.  Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.  Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.  Happy 4th of July,  Jon 
 I guess I'm not sure what you are after?  Do you have an example of another one that I could work off of ?  If I had a better idea of what kind of thing were suppose to be included I could probably get you something else.   Are we after more words or more duties.  Jon 
 Please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant, and not on the pipe, it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract.  Any deals we have that are not done under a Enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them.  Please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under.  Regards,  Jon 
 Yes, all trades have and associated contract that outlines the "performance obligations" and this is similar to NGX's.  Still waiting to talk to a lawyer on the other issues.  I will get it to you today.  Jon 
 Call me on this one.  I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X.  Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.  Hope all is going well.  Jon

 Did you know before me??............You always seem to.   I'll let you know when the beers are flowing.  See ya then.  Jon 
 Could you please do me a favor.  Deloitte is auditing our NGX feed process and they need to be able to check the integrity of our data.  Grahan Larson at Deloitte wanted us to run the query that is outline in the word doc attached with a few alterations.  He was wondering if we could include the counter party ID, counterpart flag, and the counterpart name in the query we send to him?  Could you please coordinate getting him the information he needs.   His phone number is 630-7618.  Thanks,  Jon 
 No problem....go ahead. 
 what time do you need it for? 
 Shyla,  I hope its going well!  I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.  Please give me a call to discuss.  Regards,  Jon 
 I hope this works.... 
  Ryan could you make contact with Jesus and be his contact for pricing.  Could you set up a process (maybe the bidfax) where by he can get daily pricing info.  Thanks,  Jon 
 The numbers looked good for the 18th's report of numbers for the 15th.  We will watch them closely for a couple of days.  So far 1 for 1.  Thanks,  Jon 
 Would LOVE to..............however, unable to attend due to prior commitments.  Have a glass for me.  Regards,  Jon 
 Jay,  Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.  Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.   Regards,  Jon

Do I need a lawyer?  Do any other provisions remain?  Any idea how I get paid? Any help would be appreciated!  Best Regards,  Jon   As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble Beach..........Just kidding. 
 How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.  Let me know what you want to do.  Jon 
 Hi Laura,  I hope all is going well.  The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.  I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the Enron fee rather than retail.  Hit them down the middle,  Jon 
 How about 1.5460 as the rate.  I'll just send you a cheque for USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).  Where should I send the cheque? 
 Thanks for you help 
 Cheque is in the mail.......sorry it didn't go out Friday, but with labor day weekend everyone had left early and by the time I found the place to courier it, it was closed.  I hope it arrives in time.  Regards,  Jon 
 Good morning.......... 
 Hi Stephanie,  My name is Jon McKay and I used to trade in Canada for Enron.  Could I please get access to all of the Canadian markets as I still have opportunities to trade certain locations from down here.  My login ID is ADM95363, or I can be found under JMcKay1.  Thanks for you help  Jon 
 Thank You,  I will not be needing to mange them on Stack down here.  Much appreciated! 
 Thank you 
 Scott,  I still can not seem to pull up TDS.  I can get in to the Position Manager, but I am unable to see any of the trading books (most important FT-East-new).  When you have a few minutes could you please let me know who understands/runs the system, so I can get my problem sorted out.  Thank you,  Jon 
 Dear Mr. Raffaele,  My name is Jon McKay and I just moved from Calgary, Canada to Houston.  Just prior to moving I passed the Level III C.F.A. exam and now find my self in need of a sponsor to join the Houston society.  I was wondering if you could put me in contact with some of the local charter holders so that I could obtain sponsor ship and join the Houston society.  I was not member of the society in Calgary, as I was waiting to pass the third examination before joining, but I could provide some contacts in Calgary that hold charters, who would a test to my character.  If you had a local membership list, or even just a list of Enron employee who have C.F.A. Charters that I could contact, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you can help please contact me at (w) 713 853-4810, (h) 713 225-1230 or, at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.  Thank you,  Jon McKay

 I have got some one lined up don't worry. 
 You, me, Vladi Pimenov, and his girlfriend Natalie  (who works in EES) will be going to the game.  Where would you like to meet them before we head over?

 That sounds like AOL not MSN.  I tried using that address for MSN and it said it was not available at this time.  I'll try to add you again later using that address. 
 People down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!  I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).  Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.  Jon

 I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  Geof Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.  Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.  Regards,  Jon 
 Hey Greg,  I thought I would drop you a quick note.  How are things going?  I hope your still getting lots of deals done and knocking them deal at Enron Direct.  I decided I would take a look at the Stampeder's stats before I dropped you the line.  It looks like things are getting a little better (other than turnovers).  Good luck tonight.........there is no one I hate more than the Saskatchewan Roughriders.  Regards,  Jon

 I don't think this is going to be the answer to all your problems.  It's the results of the audit.  I'm not sure they were all that successful?

 Ahhh....e-request, sorry for the inconvenience, I thought you were the gate keeper.  Thanks for all you help! 
 Adam,  The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.  If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.  Thanks,  Jon 
 Thanks for the invite, but it looks like I'm committed to going to the A&M ND game.  Jon  PS. love the in-depth feed back for my mid year review

 Could you help me obtain access to the O:\ERMS directory?  I know I'm suppose to send an email to someone, but I'm not sure who.  Thank you,  Jon

 Adam,  So far so good!  I'm only concerned with being able to print it out on one page.  If you need more space turn the print page to landscape and use smaller font.  Keep making the font smaller until either we get everything on one page or until you can't read the printout.  Do you need me to do anything?  Jon

 Sorry, for not saying good-bye when you left last night.  I thought you were at work on Thursday and I thought I would wish you well then.  So I guess, better late than never.  Have a good and safe trip!  Regards,  Jon 
 I have the squash racket in hand and I'm ready to play..........what time 5:30-6:00?  Love  Jon 
 Offers:  Nov02-Mar03, CNG Index, 5000/day @ .025 Nov03-Mar04, CNG Index, 5000/day @ .025 Apr02-Mar03, Z6 NY Index, 3000/day @ .14 Apr02-Mar03, M3 Index, 4000/day @ .045  I hope these help.  Regards,  Jon 
 Sorry Jim,  I don't really have much interest in selling the M3 and TZ6 index for those time periods (let alone any better than I quoted) and the CNG Index numbers came from Brad McKay where his two-way was .0175/.025 on both terms.  He is not in today and I am covering for him, and I will not be improving his offers in his absence.  Regards,  Jon 
 Well..............   On another note, due to the Friday effect running has been cancelled today.  If you want to go this weekend let me know. 
 How's about today at 2:00?  I looked at the map over the weekend and noticed a few areas that will need further work......overall not too bad!  Jon 
 How are you feeling today?...........I'm losing the war and thought I'd send you a note from the front......... Out look is ambiguous.  Love Jon 
 Or are we running. 
 What time do you want to run?  The earlier the better for me........bad day and I can't wait to get out of here. 
 Glen,  YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.  Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com  How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.  Jon 
 Any time after 1:30 is fine with me.  Regards,  Jon 
 You are a better man than me, yes, but I'm not so sure it will be outside. 
 Vladi,  I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal y
