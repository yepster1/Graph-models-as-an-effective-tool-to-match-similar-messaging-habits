 Scott,  I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.  Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920) Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007) Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960) Encal			C$(14,574,960)   Howard Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.  Regards,  Jon 
 Nov for 1 year	4.35 Nov for 2 year	4.5 Nov for 3 year	4.605 Nov for 5 year	4.72  Cheers.... 
 The rest should show up by Fedex tomorrow.  Regards,  Jon 
 Lucy,  Almost all basis in Canada is quoted in USD, normal convention is to quote the fixed price in CAD.  I will get Ian Cooke to send you the historical basis for AECO (in USD).  If you want a currency curve to work the numbers back into Canadian dollars we can also get you that, but I'm not sure what that would tell you.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Jon  Ian - could you please forward our historical AECO curve to Lucy  - Thanks

 Dawn,  It looks like Jason Garvey's last day is the August 17th.  Is there anything I need to do to make sure his departure is smooth from a HR stand point?   Jon 
 Todd,  Your welcome to come by at your convience, just give me a call to make sure I'm home.  I usually get home from work around 7:30pm.  I can be reached at 249-8322, and if your coming by my address is 4712 Grove Hill Rd. SW.  (This is just off 17th Avenue and 45th Street SW.)  Regards,  Jon 
 One of my flat screens will not reset and there is an unacceptable amount of static coming through.  Does anyone know of any tricks to fix this problem.  (Yes, I tried turning it off and back on again.)  Regards,  Jon 
 Hey Stephen,  Glad to hear the funds finally showed up.  It would be helpful to me if we could hook back up together in the next little while.  I'd like to get your opinion on a few different thoughts that I've had.  I need to do some "financial planning" so to speak.  Let me know how your schedule is looking  Thanks,  Jon 
 Thanks Des! 
 Kate,  Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.  Given their load profile we would be offered at 4.39/gj for supply one year out of August.  Please let me know if you need any thing else.  Best Regards,  Jon 
 We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.  Regards,  Jon 
 The current offer for these volumes 1 Year out of Oct. would be $4.615.  I hope this helps.  Jon 
 Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one),  How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?  Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.  My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?  Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.  Email me with the info. and I'll give you a call.  Love  Jon 
  Who is taking care of you? 
 David,  Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.  Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?  I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.  Let me know if I can do anything to help.  Regards,  Jon 
  Please take care of this.  Didn't we already send her the data for July?  Jon 
 Please approve  Thanks,  Jon 
 Hello,  Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a cha= nge'n with my life.  First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I d= rove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't t= hat bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You woul= d have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It = kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture,= and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com. = Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some = pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t= he traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from= New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do th= is drive?"  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She re= nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http:= //astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She too= k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thi= ng is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. T= he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro= up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo= w.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the= Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same bu= siness but none-the-less for the same company.  Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin= g to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mer= e coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really= want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part= , I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my hou= se anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have n= o problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiat= ion is in the lead as it stands.  Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me= borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV sta= nd, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store= the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for = the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in H= ouston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take = is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furni= ture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other = things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk ab= out what is best.  Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the s= ame), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself fo= r trying!  Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.  Love,  Jon =20 
 Martin  How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you = and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relat= ing to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I thin= k it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to= handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved. = Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to = the cuts and what we can and can not do.  This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is = anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.  Thanks,  Jon=20 
 Greg,  Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipel= ine declared as its force majure volume?  Jon McKay Unemployed phone: 403-974-6733 jonathan.mckay@enron.com
