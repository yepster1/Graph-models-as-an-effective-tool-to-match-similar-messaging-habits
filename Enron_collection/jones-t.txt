  Can you please provide me with the clean copies of the licenses Angela is referring to?  If I need to come pick them up to copy them, give me a call and I will do so.  Thanks! 
 Justy, thanks for your quick response.  I heard back from Edmund too, and he gave me the name of a V&E lawyer he has used in London for Russian law and Anne Koehler and I gave him a quick call.  Doug Glass.   So we switched it to NY law and ICC arbitration rules and are giving it a go.  Thanks for your help!  I can't believe our business guy call 2 hours before a lunch meeting with a Russian company and think it's business as usual! 
 I just spoke to Stephanie Sever with the EOL team, and she said this counterparty has been approved and should migrate tonight and they will send them a password out tomorrow. 
 I just agreed to the changes on the phone with Bob Klein and am going to finalize the agreement and fax it to him tomorrow and then follow-up with originals. 
  Are you having our copy walked up to me? 
 I know the online team is looking for people with paralegal experience.  Your contact would be Lisa Lees.  Lunch some other time?  Thursday or Friday?  I already have plans today and tomorrow... 
 I'll put you down too! 
  Done.  I was waiting for the EOL team to get in a new Password Application and no one told me they got it in.  I just went in and approved them. 
 Per our conversation last week, please ensure that Mark Taylor and I are your initial point of contact with respect to compliance with and/or violations by Enron North America Corp. with respect to NYMEX position limits.  Please fax Mark Taylor a copy of any correspondence with respect to our position limits.  Your assistance with this will help us monitor and maintain Enron's compliance with NYMEX rules.

 At the request of Anne Koehler, I am attaching our word version of the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service. 
 Is there a Canadian power GTC? 
 What is the nature of the business you are discussing?  Also, do you want me to send this by email?  If so, I will need thir email address. 
 Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:  1.  "executed" 2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master 3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it 4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master 5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement  Thanks for your attention herewith. 
  Any conflicts? 
 Brandon,  I need the full legal name & address of this company.  Thanks... 
  Any conflicts? 
 Another NDA.  The correct legal name of this entity is Foundry Networks, Inc.

 He's already signed for our side.  We're done. 
 There is a meeting of the Name/Change Merger Group Meeting on Monday at 1:00 pm in 49c4 to talk about timing of suspensions.  I don't know what, if any, relevance this will have for us, but since you do the name changes/mergers, I thought you might need to attend.  I wanted to forward you the email, but once I clicked yes, I will attend, it went away. 
 At the request of Brandon Wax, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no.

 Xavier, what group are you in? 
 NDA for COMYSY Information Technology Services, Inc. 
 Attached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far.  Tanya suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close-out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into Greg Whiting to see if that is the case.  I spoke to Craig Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that.  He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk.  What are your thoughts on that?  There appear to be two International Paper Deals.  Craig Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.  There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.  Craig, any knowledge of this other one?  No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no. Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no. 49011.1 for $442,000.  That just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on Debbie's list with no copy. 
 This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update? 
 Both I and Stephanie Panus plan on attending. 
 At the request of Nick Tubach, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit. 
  Here is the guaranty from Trans Alta. 
 713/661-5865 
 Thanks for the email.  I just got out of an all morning meeting.  I had already drafted the agreement for APB Europe.  I'll redraft it as directed. 
  It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them. 
 We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:  Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies  Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2 Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof  Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies  Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone. Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.  Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.   I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.  We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment. 
  OK for me. 
  I spoke to Mark Taylor and we would like Dave removed from this corporation as well.  We can date this revocation effective as of 10/1/01 as well.  We really appreciate your help with these resolutions.  I am circulating the EPMI resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed. 
  Jay,  I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this. 
  We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.  HOW GOES IT MARK???? 
  tom,  All of this relates to a broker Bob Shults wants to open up to trade on EOL.  When you have a minute can you give me or Mark a call so we can sort out who we want to trade with.  Thanks. 
  Another NDA.  This one is for the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
  Attached please find the NDA for transmittal to Bo Collins. 
 We have received an executed side letter agreement dated 08/10/01 with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. ("El Paso) which states that "notwithstanding the provisions of the Electronic Trading Agreement or the product descriptions on the EOL website, all financial derivative transactions entered into by El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. on the Web Site which are listed by either ENA or ECC will be deemed to be entered into between El Paso and ENA and will be governed the the ISDA Master Agreement between El Paso and ENA dated 12/1/99".  Copies will be distributed. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our form of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897or Bob Shults at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 We will also be getting these Mid-Market EIM Group Customer Lists on a going forward basis.  I spoke to Credit and for right now we will only be approving these counterparties to trade physical steel.  As with the regular online trading lists, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN ONE DAY, I will take it that you do not have any legal issues with the counterparties below trading. 
  Know anything about these deals? 
 Any conflicts? 
 At the request of Ross Mesquita, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 OK for you? 
 How can we find out who has a clue? 
  Nothing to report 
  Weren't we also going to get a printer in the area? 
 Not unless it's critical.  All the attorneys are out at an offsite today.  Can this wait til Monday or is this critical? 
 I will get them done today. 
 I will get them done today. 
  Can you change on my calendar.  Thanks! 
 This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.  We figure they are using the website for price discovery.  If I do not hear back from you within 24 hours whether London Legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals, it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products. 
  Per Stephanie's request, attached is an updated list. 
  I have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms.  Kim. if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me I would be most appreciative. 
 Lance,  Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks! 
  This counterparty has been updated. 
 Pretty funny!  If we could only do it for real! 
 I got a call from my buddy Mike Mulligan with Paribas in NY last night asking me to see if I can't check with you on the status of the guaranty he is trying to get in place with Enron Metals Limited.  He says he has been trying to get this in place with London for some time.  Is there some particular problem holding up this guaranty?  Is there anthing I can do to faciliate getting this guaranty to Paribas?  Please let me know... 
 I just had a voice mail from "Christine" at National Bank of Canada wanting to make a margin call and not knowing who here to call.  Can someone please call her.  Her number is 514/394-7567.  Thanks. 
  OK for me. 
 You are the best! 
  Any conflicts? 
  Erica,  Is 2Advance Studios their correct legal legal name?  Is there an Inc. or Corp. or anything there tacked on the end? 
  If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue? 
 Per our discussion, attached is the referenced NDA for transmittal to counterparty. 
 We also have lots of agreements between internal counterparties.  I also owe you more comments...I haven't forgotten... 
  Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't? 
  I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill. 
 There has been a little confusion about how this Counterparty wishes to be set up on EnronOnline, and after talking to the Counterparty, Darren Vanek in Credit, and Mary Cook we have come to the following agreement:  The counterparty will be (and I think already may be?) set up in the GCP System as Vector Pipeline, LP  I told the Counterparty that special Confirmation Templates would be prepared for this Counterparty and the signature line should be prepared as follows:  Vector Pipeline, LP, by its Managing General Partner, Vector Pipeline, LLC  By:  _____________________ Name:  __________________ Title:  ____________________  This form of signature block should be used for all EnronOnline and any offline trades for counterparty as well.  The Password Application has been executed by the Counterparty correctly so there is no need to have him re-apply. 
 Travis,  I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.  We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy. 
 Patrick,  Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them? 
 This cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."  We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.  What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you? 
 On 10/17/01 List, is this an ECP? 
  This was a good one, not a joke one. 
  That was good Kyle.  I have a few of the better bin Laden joke ones I'll forward on to you... 
  Here's one of the two humorous things.  I've been getting a lot of this bin= Laden humor stuff, but these two are my favorites so far. 
 Please send originals to me for handling.  I will give a copy to you. 
 Lance,  I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable? 
  Here's the other... 
 In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the Enron Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:  1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones 2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address 3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer 4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation. 5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up. 6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.  Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance. 
  This one isn't funny, but it's good... 
 John, that was great! 
 Re: Experian we need:  1.  Full Legal Name and Address 2.  Mark wants a more exact description of the nature of your discussions 3.  An email address so we can send it directly to counterparty 
  Any conflicts? 
  This counterparty was approved by Legal on Friday. 
  The actual name of the counterparty on this one is Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation. 
 Mary Cook wants me to put together a list of people's home ph, cell no's/pagers, in case we need to call in help during the holidays.  Can you provide me with your info in case we get surprised and have to set up additonal data rooms.  Much thanks! 
 At the request of Kim Detiveaux, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  OK for me. 
 De nada... 
  Just an FYI, my notes in my database reflect that Tri-State Generation is a Colorado Cooperative... 
  OK for me. 
 She needs to get a copy from London, I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson.  We do not have copies of London's masters. 
 They are settled, but not executed.  We have sent the ETA amendment out to the DB lawyer for signature, but we have not gotten it back signed.  I'll give here a call. 
  Do any of you have any problems with keeping these trades as they are now that we've figured out what they are.  If not we'll just keep them as they were... 
 Thanks Lance! 
 I would try Tom Moran x33017. 
  Attached is additional  correspondence from TransAlta re: the merger and guaranty info I sent you on 10/5/01.  Can you please contact TransAlta and let them know you will be handling this.  Thanks. 
  FYI, this came in and has been passed on to Stephanie Panus for handling. 
 It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest!  Anytime...  The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning...right after we announced our current earnings last week, The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders, non-disclosure of profits, etc., and have kept up with this story since last week, we have had shareholder lawsuits, SEC inquiries, our stock has taken a dive down to $15 today, down from $33 when the story first ran, and $87 since the beginning of the year.  Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight.  Anyway, you may to check the WSJ website and catch up...  Also,  I have a new boyfriend, my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months, that seems to be going well.  So that's all my news...  XXOO 
  FYI 
 Do you have copies of any of the following NDAs?  At the Moment True Exchange BizBots 
  You've want Puget Sound for approval to trade east physical power on above list, but Leslie Hansen will not approve per note below. 
  Mark,  Mark Greenberg asked me to check with you to see if Enron Corp. ever got Confidentiality Agreements in place with either True Exchange or BizBots?  Can you please let me know.  Thanks! 
 I can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are.  Can you meet with me? 
  Can you let me know whether Enron Corp. has any Confidentiality Agreements with the counterparties below.  Thanks! 
 We have received Articles of Merger from the referenced counterparty evidencing the merger of BP Exploration & Oil Inc. with and into Amoco Oil Company, with the surviving entity being Amoco Oil Company, which shall continue under the name of BP Products North America Inc., such merger being effective 10/11/01.  Copies are being sent to the usual Houston distribution.  I am sending a copy of this email to London Credit and Legal because I understand ECTRIC has done some financial trades with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  Houston Legal is awaiting Houston Credit's approval of the merger and its impact on our ISDA Master and underlying credit. 
  We appreciate all Credit does for us! 
 Nope, thanks! 
 Attached is the proposed form of NDA for your approval. 
 =20 
  Kay,  We will be getting this NDA in place for Williams, we are not exactly sure yet which of the Williams companies it will be for. 
  It appears that the fax you moved in on the 33rd floor was actively being used by Scott Tholan and his assistant on that floor (x58889).  Can your people please move it back ASAP and find us another one.  Thanks. 
      P.S.  The Mahonia ISDA Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex is attached to the Confirm. 
 At the request of Marc Eichmann, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.  Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.  Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"  MUCH THANKS!!! 
 Thanks for your help! 
 Thanks for your help Kate! 
 I just got handed another list...  Can I get the datasheets for the following companies:  Enron Global Markets LLC Enron Liquids Fuels, Inc. Enron Fuels Caribbean L.P. Enron Petrochemicals Company Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. Enron Clean Fuels Company Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Pte Ltd Enron Capital & Trade Global Resources Corp. Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. - Singapore Branch  Thanks! 
 Taria,  Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it! 
  I was out for a Dr's appt Oct. 23rd for 2 hours and Oct 19 4 hours. 
 This will get you access to Livelink 
 Any update on these faxes?  I have to get my list to Louise Kitchen today. 
  Here's set of any master agreements I need ASAP.  I didn't mention it on the earlier ones, but for all of these, if any of the agreements have been amended, I will need any amendments, as well as any guarantees.  Much thanks! 
 No, only executed amendments. 
   Sharon,  BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.  THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE! 
  Please handle.   Much thanks. 
 Yes, everything. 
  Sharon, did one of the Canadian lawyers look at the list for the things you could not identify? 
 Barbara Gray has asked me to seek your advice concerning our Enron Net Work client's request that we send a Confidentiality Agreement to an Enron Net Works customer located in Australia.  Among the issues we are concerned with are whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Australian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable or would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  When you have a minute we would be most appreciative of your input.  I have attached the form of Confidentiality Agreement we propose to submit to our customer. 
 Lance,  Did we replace the fax machine we erroneously took on the 33rd floor? 
 Already done.  See you tonight! 
 I saw you across the dining room at Luther's but you left before I got a chance to wish you a Happy New Year's.  I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week.  I'll have to take your class and you can explain to me how you went from lawyer to weathercaster.  Happy New Years again, and let's hope this year is better than the last! 
 Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.  The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.  Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.  I am proud to be an American...! 
  Anne, Mark Greenberg will not be in the office for the next two days.  Will you have time to look at this?  Thanks! 
 John wanted legal advice today, so I passed this email on to Anne Koehler for handling. 
  Larry,  Can you send me the aricles and bylaws for another company, Enron Transportation Services.  Much thanks, for ALL your help! 
 You are the best! 
 It sounds ok to me. 
 Sheri,  This project is very important to me.  However, I am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all.  I expect I am really the only one who will be giving you sustantive input.  As well, I have other design modifications we will need to incorporate.  I just wanted to give you a head's up because you are going to get ahead of me here for awhile. 
 Can you take a look at all the Canadian Agreements listed on this list provided to us by BP and verify whether these agreements exist in Canada? 
 You (as usual) are the best! 
 Mary Cook wanted me to send you an email to make sure if you are sending the Master Netting Agreement out to counterparties that you delete the last page of the agreement, which contains the user notes. 
  Teresa,  By copy of this email, I am asking Stephanie Panus, another Paralegal in our group, to handle this for you as I am on working on a special project this week.  Stephanie, per Teresa's voicemail, Cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us ASAP.  Can you please give their attorney a call.  Teresa, you forgot Mr. Gollomp's phone number. 
 At the request of Jennifer Smith, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  Thanks Sam, you're the best! 
 Bob Shults is Asking about that amendment to the Amerex Fee Agreement.  Can you help him... 
  I would like to attend.  God knows if Harry can/will come.  We'll see.  I did 12 (slow) miles last weekend... 
 Running 12 miles was no problem.  Harry & I had a little "tiff" (I hope only) this weekend, and as usual, he's out of town, so we haven't been able to talk.  So who knows? 
 I think yes. 
 Anne also requested this.  Kay young prepared and is emailing a copy to anne. 
 Per my conversations with Brandon, I am enclosing a clean and blacklined draft of the NDA revised to reflect changes in connection with your prior confidential discussions with the counterparty.  This form should be transmitted to the counterparty. 
 Steve asked me to send an email asking if you haven't already begun drafting your agreements yet, when you name you agreement, please indentify them by the counterparty and the products such as "Koch Energy-Gas" or "Aquila Marketing-Financing".  Thanks. 
  Yes they are to prepare all the UCC filings. 
  My pleasure.  Reading all that should keep you busy for awhile! 
  I don't know the answer to this.  Do you? 
 I am still using the list.  I have to circulate the list to the team from time to time. 
 Done. 
 Any idea who knows the answer to this question? 
  Can you please handle.  Thanks. 
 I wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as Mark approves the changes.  Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging. 
 Name of Company:  ERMT LLC, a Delaware limited liability company  Address:  1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas  77002 
 Branches:  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.  Restrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF. 
  Has this ever come in?  Can someone please respond to Jennifer?  Thanks! 
  Can you please handle this for Chris.  Thanks. 
 Sam,  Thanks for taking care of this! 
 So far I'm on if I don't have to work.  Harry and I broke up on Monday. 
 Done. 
 I need to know what group Nekesha is in. 
 You do not have to grant Nakesha access.  She already has view only access as does any Enron employee.  If you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database, she should be able to get view access to the database.  All Enron employees have view access.  Only employees of Legal and Credit can have edit access access.  Does that help? 
 We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.  ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.  We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.  I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.  Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.  Much thanks! 
 Edmund Cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people, credit people, companies, or change other drop downs in the database.  I have key word access on this side of the Atlantic and Edmund has it there.  If you need London Credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have Edmund go add them, or the company as a new key word. 
  I am not aware of any changes, are you? 
  Do I need to help you getting this out? 
  Who was this passed on to for handling? 
 I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that! 
 I'll give him a call. 
  Nothing to report. 
 Nothing from Legal. 
 I faxed you the alcoa ISDA immediately after we spoke.  It should be in NY right now. 
 Mark and I were just discussing the project yesterday.  I am out for Thanksgiving vacation all next week, but when I get back the week after that we definitely want to get it back on track! 
 Sure thing! 
 Do you have a full legal name for Equiva Trading? 
  Any conflicts? 
 Attached please find the NDA you requested. 
 Attached please find a current list of the Networks, EnronOnline and CommodityLogic executed and draft Confidentiality Agreements for your review. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists for your review. 
 Sheri,  I won't be back until that Thursday after Thanksgiving.  You might want to re-schedule that meeting. 
 I spoke to Norma at your store yesterday, and she said to send you an email to reserve a table.  I am with the Enron Legal Dept. and we would like to reserve a table for happy hour on Friday at 6:00 pm for 10 people.  We would like to have both wine and h'ors d'oeuvres.  If you need additional information, or if there are any problems, please call me at 713/853-3399. 
  Any conflicts? 
 With today being Leslie's day off, do you have any problems with these counterparties extending their tenor to 51 months?  This is a rush so I need to get them approved tonight. 
  OK for Legal. 
  You are the woman! 
 At the request of Albane Perinne, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  We have two additional NDA's in addition to the Live Capital one.  Any conflicts? 
 I'll approve this on today's approvals 
 Per my conversations earlier this week with Stephanie Sever and Wendi LeBrocq, I have sent down the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement and the three Password Applications necessary get the following three entities set up to start trading on EnronOnline.  Per my conversation with Stephanie and Wendi, the counterparty would like the counterparty to start trading on EOL by tomorrow.  The three entities are:  1.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agent for and on behalf of Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE) 2.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Ameren Generating Company 3.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS)  What if anything do we need to to to ensure that they can start trading by tomorrow.  The counterparty is calling me daily checking on this?  Can you please let me know? 
 As you requested, I am enclosing a revised Mutual form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  As I stated in my earlier email, if you have any comments or questions, please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-3448. 
 Janet,  Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you. 
 I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank. 
  No, I don't need one, but thanks for hunting that down! 
  No executed NDA received. 
 Who is Kevin Meredith?  I only review counterparty lists I receive from Credit. 
 It only shows a draft sent, no executed contract. 
 Per my note below, please fax the agreement to me at the fax number below, and I will have it executed by an officer at Enron and return it to you via fax.  If you would prefer to have originals executed, please send two executed originals to me, Tana Jones at 1400 Smith Street, 38th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002.  I look forward to receiving the document. 
 Your comments with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement have been forwarded on to me by Brandon Wax.  After reviewing them, we have agreed to most of your comments.  We have agreed to delete the arbitration provision but have retained the limitation of damages. Further, it is Enron corporate policy that the confidential information shall be limited to a term two years so we are unable to delete the final paragraph.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel at (713) 345-8897 or email us and let us know if these changes meet with your approval. 
  Sheila Tweed, the lawyer for this turbine product, has approved all of the counterparties on the attached list to trade this product, EXCEPT The City of Tacoma, Dept. of Public Utilities.  Let me know if you need anything further from me. 
  As you requested... 
  NDA for CheMatch, any conflicts? 
  I think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at Merita we negotiated the ISDA with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is OK to release the ISDA to you.  The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258. 
 Just a note...  I have not gotten that ISDA Master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the Atlantic.  I have asked Jay Williams in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.  I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit.  Just wanted to keep you updated... 
 At the request of Brandon Wax, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  OK for me. 
  Tom,  With respect to this NDA, do you want us to send it directly to Deloitte, or do you want to send it to them?  If you would like us to send it to them I am going to need an email address...  Let me know what you prefer... 
 No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then. 
  You should now have access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database. 
 Today. 
 As you requested: 
 Ran it by Leslie, OK for us! 
 Russell,  I want you to be my friend forever, after all, you are my favorite, ex-Credit person! 
 Thanks for the kind word! 
 At the request of Anne Koehler, I am transmitting the final draft of the referenced Guaranty. 
  I am sorry, but I checked with the lawyer, and we are going to need that executed Agreement and we are going to need it as fast as you can track it down...sorry to keep being such a pest! 
  Any conflicts? 
 As you requested, attached is the form of NDA for transmittal to your customer: 
 Anytime! 
  No time off. 
 I'll take care of this... 
 Janet,  Would you like me to fax it to you?  If so, what is your fax no? 
 I just spoke to Stacey Richardson, and, with Georgi Landau gone, she said we should contact her, or Bridgette Anderson, with any Global Contracts questions for the time being. 
 Janet,  I also thought it would save you alot of time if you are going to draft a document if you had the word version, so I am attaching it. 
 I am going away to the beach today so I am going to leave a little early today, at 2:00 pm. 
 We deserve it! 
 I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.  I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.  So, I am waiting on Credit... 
  ALL of the swap form are now back in the attorney forms bank! 
 I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks! 
  Any conflicts? 
 Anne Koehler & I had a quick call w/Doug Glass.  Thanks for his name.  We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).  And NY law.  Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.  I also heard back from Justy.  Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it! 
 Received email! 
 I'll be leaving for New Orleans in about 30 minutes for our legal conference.  It was fun visiting with you too.  I miss you terribly. 
 In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.  In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT Canada.  I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. Prior Guarantees. 
 FYI, cpy below is governmental. 
 I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with both of you.  She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.  I miss you! 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:   ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  March 31, 2000  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  Kellogg Company  Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: Weather and foreign exchange 
 Per my conversation with Lisa, I am going to open the referenced counterparty to trade financial. 
 I will be out Monday morning for my home inspection.  Also, I have my Scenic Texas board meeting at 2:00 pm in Dallas on Friday, so depending when I can get  plane reservations, I will be out some or all of Friday. 
 We have received the executed Acknowledgement and Termination Agreement dated effective as of December 1, 1999 by and among El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company (formerly known as El Paso Marketing Company, also formerly known as Eastex Hydrocarbons, Inc.), El Paso Merchant Energy Gas, L.P., El Paso Energy Corporation,  and ENA (formerly known as ECT).  Such document referenced the merger of Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. with and into El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas L.P., and the subsequent assignment of El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas LP's rights, duties and obligations to El Paso  Merchant Energy-Gas Company.  Under such agreement, the parties agree that:  1.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that (a) the Sonat Marketing Company and Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. financial Transactions shall be governed by the El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company financial Master Agreement dated as of April 20, 1995; and (b) the Sonat physical transactions shall be governed by the El Paso Enfolie Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated March 1, 1998; 2. El Paso Energy Corporation, as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above; 3.  Enron Corp., as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above; 4.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that the Sonat financial Master Agreement dated as of September 1, 1994, and the Sonat Master Firm Purchase/Sale physical Master Agreement, will be terminated; 5.  Each of ENA, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and El Paso Energy Corporation agree that the Sonat physical Guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Sonat financial Guaranty guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Enron Corp. financial Guaranty dated as of August 28, 1995 and the Enron Physical Guaranty dated May 1, 1994 are thereby terminated.  All of the above is rather complex, and I've tried to reduce 3 pages of "Whereas" clauses into 1 paragraph, but I will distribute the document to the usual suspects, so any confusion about parties should become clearer. 
 On the attached list please note that per my email of 04/17/00, U.S. Gas Transportation, Inc. has been acquired by Aquila.  Future trading for this counterparty should be done out of the name USGT/Aquila LP. 
 Any update yet? 
 No, a transaction had been entered into, the Master Agreement to govern it was signed, getting the certificates was one of the requirements under the agreement. 
 Jan, that was good, thanks for sharing it! 
 Mark asked if you could work on the following with our new secondee, Jason. I provided Jason a hard copy yesterday since he didn't have a computer yet. Thanks! 
 I've been a little distracted.  I've had a contract on a new house, and we had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving forward for a May 5 closing.  Also, I have had short in an electric line that keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!  Dalzenia has been in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can replant my garden...it's always something.  Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.  How do I go about doing that? 
 My closing is set for June 5, move-in date for my new house is June 9, so there should be no problem. 
 We have a new lawyer that started in our group yesterday.  His name is Jason Peters.  Can you get him added to the Master Swap Agreement database ASAP. Thanks.  How goes moving the Portland masters? 
 I am available Saturday after my morning run.  If you would like some help I would be happy to help out! 
 Can we get some credit?  Much thanks! 
 I needed to whine with you yesterday about my favorite nat gas trader and couldn't get hold of you...and then my favorite lazy paralegal already passed on some of her work to me! 
 Can you give view access only to Marie Heard, Robbi Rossi, and Cynthia Harkness with Bandwidth Legal to the referenced database.   Thanks! 
 Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty.  Please remember to fax the counterparty U.S. IRS Tax Forms  1001 and Form W-8.  Thanks. 
 It  appears the online people have revised the initial counterparty list. 
 FYI  Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at Cadwalader to determine if using the word "exchange" in a corporation's name would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.  Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word "exchange" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in using "exchange" in your corporate name, however, putting "exchange" in a company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.  He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea. 
 I guess you mean Wendi, no Molly? 
 I forget when you are coming?  If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in the Asia/Pacific Group will be having his XVIII Annual La Dolce Vita Party which is always a great blast, and I'll secure you an invite too...let me know...! 
 This time I just pulled out the notebook with the drafts of confidentiality agreements you left one of them to do, and they didn't bother to file them in the binder, they just stuck them in so when I pulled the file out, the documents fell out. 
 The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out, Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it. 
 Mr. Uretsky,  At the request of Michael Danielson, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  If the agreement meets with your approval, could you please have it executed by an authorized officer of Viant Corporation and fax it to me for signature by Enron North America Corp.   If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call me.  My phone no. is (713) 853-3399 and my fax no. is (713) 646-3490.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.  All of our forms are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out soon. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated April 10, 2000, effective  as of November 25, 1997, wherein Tembec Inc. assigned its interest in Contract No. #J7774.1 dated March 23, 1998 to National Bank of Canada.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000.  This amendment revises the ISDA Master Agreement with the referenced counterparty to bring the agreement up to current form standards with changes including, but not limited to:  1.  Adding the Canadian Securities Acts representation; 2.  Making certain changes to elections with respect to Payments on Early Termination and amending the Setoff language; 2.  Makes changes to certain credit provisions, including letter of credit provisions, the form of letter of credit, the Independent Amount,, and amends the definition of "Material Adverse Change" .  Copies will be distributed. 
 On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a determination...but you know that...! 
 I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!  Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here early enough to do that either...  Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.  Don't be shy about calling me if you need any help with anything!  I mean it! 
 All's I have to say is I was here this morning before 7:00 am, and I was the only person here until 8:00 am (if you catch my drift)... 
 Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.  If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's ready to leave... 
 Yes to both questions... 
 I hope we are confirming trades under the new TXU ISDA Master...?! 
 Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was over there.  Thanks! 
 I have forwarded the Statoil/J.Aron trades down to Bob Klein and Jeff Sorenson to sign off on the actual deals listed.  I'll keep you posted... 
 Would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since I am going to have to send it up to Canada for signature.  Much thanks! 
 We have received the faxed executed Confidentiality Agreement dated April 18, 2000 with Fieldston Publications.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 I'm not Tim.  Perhaps you'd better contact him some other way. 
 I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.  The only thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated out.  What's happening with that? 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.  The copy will be forwarded to Dave Samuels.  It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.  If there is some otherr person than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know. 
 Attached is our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty.     cc:  Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel 
 There is a document called "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" in Marie's directory where we all input any CA we have sent.  For some reason since last week it has appeared as a "read only" document", so I cannot input the agreements I am working on right now.  Can you get that fixed.  Thanks! 
 Can you email over to me your Paragraph 11 too!  Thanks again. 
 Attached is our form of Confidentiality Agreement which we would prefer to use.  If after reviewing our agreement you still prefer to use your own form, Carol St. Clair, an attorney in our group will have to get back to you with our comments.   I will wait to hear from you. 
 Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!  I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth counterparties:  1.  Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 28, 2000.  It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global Contracts.  2.  The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC should be used here.  If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get someone who can! 
 You are the one!  I hope everything works out, keep me posted and let me know if there's anything I can do to help! 
 Faxed the signed document to me at (713) 646-3490.  My direct phone in case you have any questions is (713) 853-3399. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.

 Frank, can you email us both a copy of the GTC that the counterparty is seeing on the system.  Thanks! 
 The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like me to fedex it to you? 
 It's always nice to chat with you too!  I'd love to go to lunch, I'm going to put in on my calendar to call you when I get back so we don't forget until the next time we see each other. 
 Lorna,  Thanks for following up on this! 
 Getchen is in our personnel dept.  She will coordinate filling job positions with candidates.  If you just emailed her your resume, you might want to give her a few days because she is working on lots of jobs.  I've used her before, so you might want to mention my name, say I work in the Enron North America Legal Dept.  She is really sweet. 
 Taffy,  Can you take care of faxing him a copy of the ISDA and guarantees ASAP. Thanks! 
 Attached is the form of Letter of Credit you requested.  Also, I am still working to get that info from London on the margin funds and securities.  They are working on it so I hope to get it to you soon.  They are the only holdout. 
 Just to give a head's up,  In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of EnronOnline. 
 Let's chat about attached...! 
 I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades. Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with me on this? 
 I printed out the referenced list that you sent me, but it has some information on it that I don't think we necessarily want to show the NYMEX. Specifically, your last two columns that show "cmbTaxType" and "tg/Active". Is there any way you can reprint the list only showing the name of the corporation and the place of incorporation?  Thanks. 
 It wasn't at the bottom of my list, but it appears it was at the bottom of London's list. 
 Per your request a few weeks ago, Global Contracts prepared a list of executed financial masters for Bob Bowen which he forwarded up to me.  Let me know what you think. 
 Attached is the form of Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service. 
 As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global Contract and the online crew.  Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality agreement with Human Code, Inc. dated May 3, 2000.  Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults. 
 The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened. Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to my select, special friends! 
 Well, I was here by 7:30 this am and guess who's still not here yet?!  Think harder, I know you can get this one...! 
 Anthony,  You never got back to me on whether this date was good and the total head count.  Can youu please confirm this.  Thanks. 
 We have received the Confidentiality Agreement with Novo MediaGroup, Inc. dated  May 2, 2000.  Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults.  I am also attaching an updated list of the EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements. 
 Ding, ding, ding...!  You're ready for Who Wants to be a Millionaire! 
 I have created a new subdirectory aptly called "Confidentiality Agreements" and have moved Marie's list of Confidentiality Agreements there, the list of EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreement and the two EnronOnline forms of Confidentiality Agreements. 
 What is going on with the revisions to the tax language in the ISDA?  I spoke to Marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of "ISDAexh.doc "was sent to Rhett Jackson for review and as far as she know it hadn't been signed off on.  Obviously, we still have the old language in the form and we need to get this updated. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with MarchFIRST dated April 27, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 In my directory. 
 You don't appear to have attached the list...    "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 05/04/2000 12:33 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated May 2, 2000 with the referenced counterparty.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 I'm ok.  Can you put it on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Here's an updated confirm on Saga.  Bernice is awaiting your approval. 
 1.  5/2/00 List:  Per my conv. w/ CIBC World Markets, they are a U.K. incorporated company, and will be trading only out of New York  2.  5/3/00 List:  We are not changing our prior approvals, which included "no power" , which Leslie Hansen has reconfirmed. 
 Nancy,  Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one you are making.  The directions to my house are as follows:  1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is "Ashby", make a right on Ashby. 4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the back yard.  My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look forward to seeing you there! 
 We definitely have enough people for a party.  I haven't heard back from some people yet, I'll keep trying.  I hope to have some responses when I get home from work tonight.  Atached is of list of the status so far:    What do you think? 
 Andrea,  The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your choice!  - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 Great choice, I got several responses last night and that was not one of them!  All the recipes look really good (as usual). 
 Suzanne,  Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.  Can you coordinate with him the exact head count as we get closer.  Thanks! 
 I got several responses last night and this morning by email, so I am attaching a revised list. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World Markets plc.  Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed 
 I've got the dinner schedules for 7:30 pm.  Your choice was perfect.  There was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook.  I couldn't have planned it better! 
 Jeff Hodge is your man! 
 There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.  I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.  I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full time to this project finally.  So that's my story, how are you? 
 Attached are the recipes.  I sent you them all because they all looked so good.  Will you be talking to Steve?  I left him a voicemail about the dinner.  I have scheduled him for the garlic bread.  I guess I will just mail him the recipe.  - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 Attached are the recipes for the Church Gourmet Dinner.  I've got you down tor the pork chops (Alicia says  to make it a mix of pork and chicken).  All the recipes looked really good, so I thought you might want to look at them anyway.  The directions to my house are as follows:  1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is "Ashby", make a right on Ashby. 4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the back yard.  My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look forward to seeing you there!   - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 I left a message for Judy Wells and will keep you posted.  Hopefully by the end of the weekend I should have an exact head count so I can tell people how much to make.  So far we've got 12.  The only recipe so far that is unclaimed is the Roasted Red Pepper Dip, you could either do that, or based on the number of people, you may do another of the meat recipe, since probably that will be the most expensive.  Why don't we chat (via email!) Monday and figure out the best way to go.  I've got a call into Peter Shaddock to see if I can borrow his barbecue grill and if he can get it to my house.  Another thing too, does the Church have folding tables and chairs to borrow? My table will only sit 6 at the best. 
 I can go either way on this.  I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not enough tables.  But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.  I used to have a nice folding table but it was stolen out of my garage.  If you host it I would be happy to help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...! 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex A for the referenced counterparty.  Please call me at x33399 or Sara at x35620 if we can be of further assistance. 
 Do you have a fax no?  I could fax them to you... 
 Are we in agreement that you will be hosting the dinner.  If so, I will need to call everyone and let them know the change of plans.  In furtherance of that, I will need direction to your house to provide them. 
 Lisa,  I was returning your phone call to Carol St. Clair about the agreement and deleted the message by mistake before I got to your phone no.  Can you give me a call at (713) 853-3399.  Thanks! 
 I'll wait to hear from you tommorow.  "Lisa Taylor" <ltaylor@Cysive.com> 05/08/2000 02:39 PM 
 Bob McInosh from Rock-Tenn called yesterday, and they did a trade with us and owe us money and he doesn't know where to send it.  His phone no. is (770) 263-4456, fax. (770) 248-4402.  If someone could contact him with our wire transfer instructions.  It will probably be in the confirm you send him. 
 At the request of Anita Herrera, I am enclosing a copy of a list that shows the discrepancies that our records show from the list we were sent of trades to be assigned to J. Aron.  Please resolve the trades issues directly with Bob Bowen.  His # is 713/853-7859. 
 At the request of Anita Herrera, I am sending you a list of discrepancies with the J. Aron trades.  I tried to send this earlier and attached the wrong documents.  Please disregard that email and delete it.  Thanks. 
 Can you take care of sending him the executed documents! 
 Can you help me figure out the Portland thing so we can get this database opened...thanks! 
 Attached is our bilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement when both parties are providing Confidential Information. 
 I don't think you can bird dog her too much.  She receives in the emails and forwards them on to the relevant job group.  The person with the job then decides who they do or do not want to interview.  I don't think Gretchen will have much to do with that. 
 If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database from "Executed" to "Executed-Under Amendment".  Once a master is executed, "Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you should ever choose.  If you change it to "Draft Sent", "Under Negotiation", etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters. 
 How many times do we have to say this?! 
 Are we having your group meeting today?  Inquiring minds want to know... 
 Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement. We have not consented to the Statoil/J. Aron assignment (in principal yet, in actuality, no).  We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.  Only then can we move the trades...    Tanya Rohauer 05/09/2000 01:36 PM 
 The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 (last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the middle or toward the end of May.    Trey Hardy 05/09/2000 01:43 PM

 There has been a change in plans, the dinner is now going to be held at Pastor Beth's.  A list of who is coming, what they are preparing and directions to Pastor Beth's house are attached.  Laura, is Steve getting the recipe from you or Pastor Beth?  Pastor Beth, I've got you coordinating with Matthias & Karen.  I've faxed the recipes to Karl & Ulf.  July Weller is the only one I need to assign a recipe.  I'm hoping she'll do one of the Gazpacho recipes since it's a little more complicated.  Everyone else I having doing double recipes. I'll keep you posted... 
 I just forwarded directions to Pastor Beth's and a note about the number of people.  Did you get it?  We just got Windows 2000 and I'm having trouble with my emails...    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/09/2000 02:35 PM 
 I have opened the referenced counterparty to trade weather online.  However, they should continue to use the same special form of confirm that they are using offline until we get an ISDA Master in place with them. 
 We cannot move the trades until we agree to the assignment, which we have not done yet.  We are resolving the trades being assigned, so don't move the trades until you hear from me.  Bob Bowen has been working on this on the confirm desk side. 
 Yes, we will be having it at Pastor Beth's.  Do you need directions?  It's at 7:00 pm.    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/09/2000 03:55 PM 
 We will have 14 people.    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/10/2000 08:03 AM 
 I didn't havw any time off. 
 Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement you requested. 
 At your request, attached is the bilateral Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty. 
 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  If you have any questions or comments concerning the agreement please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Taylor, Assisant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7459.  If the agreement meets with your approval, please have it executed by an authorized officer and return it to me via fax at (713) 646-3490. 
 This Koch trade you sent me is a London based Credit counterparty, not a Houston counterparty so I have no information on it.  You are going to have to resolve this with London Legal, Edmund Cooper  who is an attorney in London at  011 44 20 7783 5382. 
 Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.  I need to respond to EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.  The list is broken up into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).  You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to trade is the Singapore based group of products. 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  With respect to the list for 5/8/00, Imperial Oil Resources and Pengrowth Corporation were on the initial approval lists.  We have a duplicate Global Counterparty # open for Imperial.  The second one needs to be shut down. 
 Attached is the form of ETA Amendment we executed with Koch Energy Trading. The referenced Diamond Shamrock/Koch joint venture would like to execute the same one.  Is this OK with you.    Forever in your debt...Tana 
 Melissa,  I still need to return the prior PG&E guarantees referenced below to the counterparty.  Were you having them pulled? 
 1.  Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty. Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron guarantees out with the counterparty?  2.  Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty? 
 Attached for signature is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need two executed copies since both parties have to execute the Guaranty.  This ISDA Master Agreement will supersede and replace an existing Master Agreement with this Counterparty, and this Enron Corp.Guaranty will supersede and replace the previous Enron Corp. Guaranty dated as of March 4, 1994.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 It looks like you finally made the cut again! 
 I have lots of blanks on my approvals on the attached list for several European products.  If you know any of the answers, can you please just hand write them in and fax them back to me, or email a more recent list you might that addresses the European approvals.  Much thanks. 
 She didn't return my phone calls from yesterday either, so if you can go ahead and double the batch, just making one batch w/o the shrimp for our vegetarian and non-fish eaters.  Thanks for your help! 
 I am still trying to get the countries of incorp. on the Japan List for you. Tom Moran is out today so I have to get them from Tracy Ngo. 
 What do the numbers "4" and "8" mean on your list?     Edmund Cooper 05/12/2000 04:14 AM 
 I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to have to email people the link to get in. 
 Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to people outside of Legal and Credit.  You will be able to use this database to verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues.  Jeff, once we  have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is still in progress).  Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to have view access to this database.  I will have to email them the link. 
 Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one sitting!  My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit. I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis fountain.  He's just lovely!  Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of the 4th of July holiday.  You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about things I can picture what you're talking about.  Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of poor Willow.  Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think I gave it justice.  It was good talking to you the other day!  I'll give you a call when I get back. 
 You're a star!    Stacy E Dickson 05/12/2000 01:59 PM 
 Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.  I ran them by Mark Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.  If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no. is (713) 853-7459.  I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in touch with me my phone no. is (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I understand either of you gentlemen can advise me on what legal issues, if any, we might have with trading the new Singapore online products with my US based counterparty list..?  Do we have any issues trading those products with counterparties incorporated in any specific country? 
 Attached please find referenced list.  A few notes:  No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese counterparties.  Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 11, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of= =20 the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under = an=20 ISDA Master Agreement.

 We have received the following two executed Confidentiality Agreements:  1.  Dow Jones & Company, Inc. dated May 11, 2000  2.  Cysive, Inc. dated May 12, 2000  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels.  I am also attaching a revised copy of the Online Confidentiality Agreement List.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions on the list. 
 I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).  We won't get the letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.  I spoke to Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.  I'll pass on the approval letter and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter. 
 No wonder you couldn't find it!  Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can see it, the job will be open outside Enron.  Didn't you think the job sounded perfect!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 05/16/2000 10:50 AM

 I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to physical trading and the online account.  I also called the company and got a copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment. 
 can you give these three people in London Legal access to the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Thanks. 
 At the request of Rahil Jafry, attached is our form of bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.   Please let me know if the attached meets with your approval. 
 Attached is the list referenced above, revised to approve Imperial Oil Resources (cpy ID 58981) for all products but power (of course no credit derivatives).  The other Imperial Oil Resources Limited  from the original approvals (cpy ID5193), I would like shut down for all products until I am provided information as to how it differs from the other Imperial Oil Resources.  Whew...!!! 
 The check is in the mail...no really...!!!  Actually, I meant to give it to you at breakfast last weekend, but I have no memory.  Do you want to run Saturday again.  Do the Rose Garden run?    MONTALBANO.HOLLY@heb.com 05/09/2000 03:49 PM 
 How about this afternoon, right after lunch, before I start getting phone calls!    Greg Johnston 05/18/2000 11:23 AM 
 I have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to Melba Lozano on the Confirmation Desk for handling. 
 Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them. They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit. 
 I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions (brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading policy? 
 Attached please find the referenced lists. 
 Thanks for your help! =20 
 I spoke to Greg Johnston, one of the Canadian lawyers who is currently seconded here, and have determined the following:  Imperial Oil Resources is an Alberta limited partnership.  All Canadian transactions are entered into with this counterparty.  Imperial Oil Resources Limited is the General Partner of Imperial Oil Resources.  We do not transact business with this entity. 
 Thanks for the T-Shirt and the magic wand.  People have already been at my desk trying to steal my magic wand, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.  That was sweet of you to think of me! 
 Done... 
 The ballots are due in New York on June 20, and there are no provisions made for faxing the ballots, so we need to mail them in time to be received by the due date. 
 Per conv. w/Anthony, we should expect 13 people.  We do not need to teleconference anyone in.  Anthony wanted the London Global Contracts people on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact London Legal if they would like a presentation. 
 We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) effective as of 06/29/99.  Copies will be distributed.  IMPORTANT:  All confirmations for this counterparty must contain the following representation:  "Each party represents that it is in compliance with the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the board resolutions or other guidelines that are applicable to such party's execution and performance of this Transaction." 
 Sorry for my hold up on this list.  I had an issue with the division/dba approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.  We will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with divisions/dba's in the future.  For this Koch counterparty:  Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name gets amended to read as follows:  Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.  (FYI, this is the way we styled the ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.) 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 12, 2000.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Teresa Smith. 
 We have received Confidentiality Agreemend executed as of May 17, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 The list looks OK except take off Clement Abrams and Ted Murphy.    Suzanne Adams 05/22/2000 02:25 PM 
 Luanne Geison at J. Aron left me a message that their guaranty is being processed and she expect to have it ready early to mid week and will fedex it to us. 
 You can take them off.  I spoke to Sara and Marie didn't want them to attend and that is fine with Sara.    Suzanne Adams 05/23/2000 09:19 AM 
 With respect to El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., this counterparty was on yesterday's list as an amended counterparty, but it is actually a new counterparty.  It should be approved for all products but power. 
 Thanks Bob!     Bob Bowen 05/23/2000 02:09 PM 
 Melissa,  I still need to forward over the documents listed below.  Have you, or someone in your group, been able to track them down. 
 Per my conversation a minute ago with Leslie Hansen, El Paso Merchant Energy is OK to trade power, so I have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that change. 
 I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!  We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood Services.  I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before. We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft master to about a year ago.  Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial with us?  Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?  By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?  You Credit guys live high on the hog!  You must have a bigger budget than us! 
 At the request of Mike Danielson, I am attaching our form of NDA.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 (fax no 713/646-3490) or Mike at (713) 853-9052.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I'm not exactly sure what your email is getting at.  No matter what the financial product is, if we have a financial master agreement in place we should tie the financial master to the product.    Karen Lambert 05/24/2000 04:17 PM

 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  It is our desire to have this agreement executed before the Tuesday, May 30 meeting with Louise and Mark Crosno.  If you have any comments or questions please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Taylor, V.P. and Assistant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7549.  Sincerely,  Tana L. Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Please ignore my last list and use this one!! 
 We have received the executed amendment to the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 16, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Mark Taylor, the attorney I work for, has agreed to the changes you made, so if you would like to process the agreement on your side and fax the signed copy to me I will have it executed by an authorized officer here.  Thanks for your prompt review and have a nice Memorial Day holiday!      Timothy Sturm <TSturm@Altra.com> 05/26/2000 03:23 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 29, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Here's that physical deal you were inquiring about.  Stacy is a physical lawyer and will be taking care of that assignment. 
 Where are you going?!     Lisa Gillette 05/30/2000 09:46 AM 
 Good luck with the next stage of your life.  It has been a pleasure working with you!    Tobin Carlson 05/30/2000 09:52 AM 
 Anthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, you've got to have them somewhere there.  Maybe they're with some old Margie Wright files.  But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there. 
 I would like to take the following time off:  Wednesday, May 31 - I need to leave at 3:00  My new house closing is on Monday June 5 at Partner's Title in the old Texas Commerce Bank Bldg.- they haven't set the time yet I will be taking two days off in June to move into my new house - June 12 & 13  My old house sale closes on Monday, June 19 - also at Partner's Title - they haven't set the time yet  Let me know if there are any problems... 
 So I guess I'll be hearing from you when you need Confidentiality Agreements.  So we'll still get to work together!     Lisa Gillette 05/30/2000 10:03 AM 
 Lorraine, Mike is wrong.  I never got the fax of the executed NDA.  May he could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!    Lorraine Becker 05/31/2000 06:43 AM 
 Can you get the new attorney in our group, Jason Peters access to both the Financial Trading Database and the Online Trading Database.  Please let us know when he has access.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the revised list of our Online Confidentiality Agreements. Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or changes. 
 Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.  It appears Aurora Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.  We have an ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.  Further, per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC. 
 I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Someone went into one of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it wasn't.  If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please consult with him.  Thanks 
 It's about 1 1/2 hour drive outside of the City.  I think if you wanted to ride you would only be able to do it weekends.  Are you still interested? 
 Edmund,  Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a master swap agreement executed.  With this email Global Counterparty can open the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo.    If we get the master in signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation  (like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending the email.  Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.  We used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.  Does this make sense?...  I am now going to look for one with special instructions...  Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed documents I send down to them.  Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a copy in the Global Contract file) 
 Mary Solmonson is a Senior Director with ENA.  Business purpose was to discuss online issues.    Taffy Milligan 06/01/2000 02:19 PM 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)  Effective Date:   08/14/94  Executed Date:   05/11/00  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:   J. Aron & Company  Transactions Covered:  All products, except pulp & paper   Please note the following:  1. This ISDA Master Agreement supersedes and replaces the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated as of   03/09/93. 2. Incorporated is the ISDA Master Agreement is the consent to the assignment by Columbia Energy Services Corporation ("CES") to ENA of the financial transactions between CES and J. Aron & Company. 3. J. Aron & Company is the Calculation Agent and Confirming Agent under the ISDA Master Agreement.

 I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover (and clean from my construction work).  I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast and dinner included!  Such a deal!  I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.  I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them yet.  What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things going on? 
 We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the "Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit. Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access so I can email them the agent to open the database.  Much thanks! 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I will forward it to them.  We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.   Link --> 
 This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.  Stacy Dickson will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears she has not yet. 
 You scared me...I went in to make sure I sent the list to everybody!! 
 How about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading? 
 I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them up they will have a cow!!  1.  When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.  They are insistent that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to in the master apply.  2.  All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, should roll up under the master.  As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.  I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!! 
 I am still waiting for responses on the 5/30/00 list.  I hope to have it to you shortly. 
 Thanks, as usual!!     Leslie Hansen 06/02/2000 11:33 AM 
 I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the approved swap forms there.  The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".  I hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.  Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc), industrial-canadian, etc..  I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.  I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.  If there is a form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.  This should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office.  To the U.K. and Singapore:  We are going through a form revision process here in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies of the changes to you for your review. 
 FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until I am given further instruction.  As with all the online documents I am getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.  We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.  The original is being sent to Dave. 
 We have received the executed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement dated 5/24/00 with the referenced party.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Mike Danielson. 
 Just a reminder that I will be at my house closing Monday morning... 
 As you requested... 
 FYI, you've got several people on the referenced resolution that are no longer in your group.  You might want to take a look at it... 
 We have a new paralegal in our group, Samantha Boyd, she just started Monday.  Can you get her Master Swap Agreement access.  Thanks! 
 I am going to have to leave the Group Meeting a little early tomorrow.  The online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 10:30 am Tom Moran and I are going to give a presentation on online approval procedures. 
 Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:  We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all financial immediately. 
 I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial. Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until they get your email.  Thanks. 
 Samantha,  When you get in let's take a look and see if you can get into the Master Swap Agreement Database. 
 Kal,  Attached is your agreement.        Kal Shah 06/06/2000 03:54 PM 
 I have jury duty scheduled for June 23 at 8:00 am. 
 At Stephanie's request, I am approving the following three counterparties to transact Enron power SALES only prior to these counterparties coming out on tonight's Credit approval list (when we will do the full approvals):  The three new counterparties are:  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania Electric Company  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan Edison Company  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central Power and Light Company  Call me if you have any questions... 
 It is always a pleasure working with the online team,  You all keep me busy but you are always kind and thankful, and believe me, those thanks are always appreciated!     Lisa Gillette 06/07/2000 04:08 PM 
 Correct!     David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 06/07/2000 07:48 PM 
 I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type of financial power transactions they can enter into:  1.  The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options 2.  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options 3.  Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy prices swap, put & call options.  Per my discussions with Tom, this counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power.  They have a really old form of agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial transactions.  I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an ISDA.  I am going to talk to Credit about this.  They will definitely not be able to trade financial power by Monday... 4.  PXRE Corporation - weather only 5.  Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only 6.  Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only 
 Michael is the person.  Keep me posted if you don't get access.  How are you?  How goes the weight training?  Don't be a stranger... 
 In my absence on Monday and Tuesday, can you forward the counterparty approval lists to Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, and she will forward them on to my distribution, so we can at least get people reviewing the lists while I am out.  Much thanks! 
 Boy, I'd like to know where I'm going to be for the next 2 days too!    Tom Moran 06/09/2000 09:19 AM 
 I look forward to it!  I was talking to Genia and I also heard how lovely your house looked...I can't wait to see yours too!    Leslie Hansen 06/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open them up for power.  US emissions has been opened.      P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract. 
 Attached is the referenced Annex B.  Call me if I can be of further help. 
 Always my pleasure. ...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?!    John Suttle 06/09/2000 01:30 PM 
 I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend will achieve "favored Credit person" status.    John Suttle 06/09/2000 03:42 PM 
 Dan,  I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.  Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting it signed.  Her phone no. is 853-9188.  I understand you need it signed by Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.  As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).  If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399. 
 You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.  For you, it would have much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.  I would certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to compete with sweet Russell...    John Suttle 06/09/2000 04:04 PM 
 Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you couldn't get those types of files in England).  One of our assistants got a call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.  So if you do want the blue files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the Atlantic again.  We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no big deal. 
 I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  In my absence, Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, will forward the Counterparty Approval Lists to you once she receives them from Credit. Please return any responses you might have to me.  Thanks! 
 I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality agreements.  On a going forward basis can you please provide that information along with the other info you give me.  Thanks!  I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.  If you have a RUSH Confidentiality Agreement that can't wait until Wednesday, call Mark Taylor at x37459 and he will find someone else in our Group to prepare it.  Louise, don't worry about Continental.  Mark is working on getting it signed in my absence!

 Are you going to be sending me some credit? 
 I'm so depressed...I wanted to work on this for you...!!    William S Bradford 06/12/2000 03:25 PM 
 I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.  Now Erica has received back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).  Can you work out what supplies you want from us.  We are happy to order whatever you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what the supplies are worth.  Thanks. 
 I don't know what a terminations number is?!    Carol St Clair 06/12/2000 11:52 AM 
 Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and moved into my new house.  I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.  This yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.  Hopefully, some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house! 
 Here's the excuse we need to get me up there for the Stampede!  Isn't it coming up soon? 
 Yes, we do have a standard Enron guaranty form.  It is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc (both the Enron & counterparty guarantees are in there). 
 We have not yet received the executed documents. 
 You can go back sending the counterparty lists only to me and Mark Taylor. Thanks! 
 Just a reminder that I will be taking Friday afternoon off to meet the cable tv guy, then, my closing on my old house is set for Monday at 3:30 pm. 
 How can a non-bank be a multibranch entity?  If I remember, we spent a hour with London over the phone discussing just this issue! 
 Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the approval.  We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always contain the most current resolution. 
 I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.  I mentioned to him our agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner, he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously, mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just changing it for any cross-border issues.  I told him I would run it by our Credit Dept. 
 We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX for 2000.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary Companies.  Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help with this! 
 We got a call from the NYMEX today, and they received another Access terminal that appears to be slated for Enron.  My understanding is that we have the five terminals that I ordered.  You do have your two in Portland, don't you?  Please confirm that for me.  Thanks! 
 We have received the executed Second Amendment to Guaranty Agreement dated as of June 9, 2000.  This amendment changed the guaranty of Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA ("Guarantor") with respect to the physical transactions with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. and financial transactions with Neumin Production Co. to an unlimited guaranty.  The original guaranty amendment will be sent to Credit. 
 Per my conv. a minute ago with Maryann Friel, they will be fedexing the documents out to us tonight! 
 You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they would like to send us one we will take a look at it.    David P Dupre 06/15/2000 10:40 AM 
 We have finally received the executed Termination Agreement for the two Koch physical trades done in error on EOL (which have already rolled off the books!).  The deal nos. are EOL Nos. 103992 and 104018.  I am sending the original to Bob Bowen. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assigned two physical trades to CIBC World Markets Plc.  Those two deal Nos are EOL deal no 137945 and 149472.  The originals will be sent to Bob Bowen. 
 To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:  1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty 2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since it is written more in our favor. 3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided. 4.  The address of the counterparty 5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty  Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.     Teresa Smith@ENRON 06/15/2000 10:59 AM 
 We had a new paralegal start in our group Monday.  Her name is Susan Bailey. Can you get her access to our Master Swap Agreement Database.  Thanks. 
 I just wanted to let you know that Shari Stack is working on that Talisman letter.  It was good talking to you, as always.  I hope you got out and "stomped" a little bit! 
 You're the best!    Teresa Smith@ENRON 06/15/2000 01:04 PM 
 The Power Desk directed me to give John Galperin, our broker with Salomon, Smith Barney a call to get the May Entergy volumes.  John spoke to the NYMEX and they came back with a figure of -0- contracts traded in May, with a total of 34 Entergy contracts traded so far for 2000 (all months). 
 I can be there, but I have to be home by 1:00, because the cable tv guy is going to show up sometime between 1-5.    Taffy Milligan 06/15/2000 02:31 PM 
 Tanya, "eligible" is spelled wrong...otherwise, lovely credit worksheet!    Carol St Clair 06/15/2000 03:19 PM 
 I will be able to attend. 
 I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North America and its trading affiliate offices.  This includes Houston, Calgary, London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.  Can someone with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this to.  Thanks! 
 If we are going to vote on the NYMEX demutualization plan the ballots are due tomorrow, so today is your last possible day to get them out, since it only provides for mail in ballots, no faxes this time.   I check and both Mark and Kevin are in, for right now! 
 Done. 
 I do not have an individual list.  It will have to got to all the employees in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is pretty much the list I had below.    Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON Sent by: Erika Vaughan@ENRON 06/19/2000 02:24 PM 
 I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have not received such approval.  With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.  Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with assigning the online account over... 
 Wouldn't you like to know which of the two Susan's gave her notice today!?! 
 I called Haedicke to check on the status of his Rappaport conversation, and he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax in the ballots, which I have done (I got Kevin's too). 
 I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too. 
 Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?    Greg Johnston 06/20/2000 02:41 PM 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the original list, I open them up for it just in case.  Also, I opened them up for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for financial.    , 
 I just wanted to check for one of our British attorneys who is coming into town next month to confirm he is registered for a seminar.  Do you have Mark Elliott registered for Derivatives I on August 8 and 9.  Can you confirm this for me so I can confirm it for him.  Thanks! 
 Please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below (I think Sydney is our Australia office).  I have revised the letter a little and am reattaching  it.  Thanks!       Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON Sent by: Erika Vaughan@ENRON 06/19/2000 02:58 PM 
 Mike, I thought you were taking care of this for me.  What happened?  P.S. Does Samantha Boyd has full access to the database also? 
 I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.  Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?  Anything else special you think I need to mention? 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between Continental Airlines, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline LLC dated June 19, 2000.  A copy will be distributed to Daniel Diamond and Dave Samuels. 
 Just a followup note:  We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!). 
 FYI,  I spoke to my contact in the NYMEX Marketing Group and she told me that the NYMEX demutualization vote passed 140-11. 
 The draft of the email you sent Mark looks OK in terms of its content.  Is there any way I will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails? 
 Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that might be responsible for filing original guarantees.

 Just wanted to give you a head's up.  We received last night from ED&F Man their form of proposed Clearing Agreement with the OMLX.  It appears they simultaneously sent it to the OMLX.  I am having my assistant fax a copy to you.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this morning.  As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few weeks ago, and they've now come back with their form.  I don't know how customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look at it here and give you a call.

 She's not too far away from snapping...!  I'm afraid to say anything.    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/21/2000 05:27 PM 
 Yes it does.  It includes any original guarantees we may be giving or receiving.     Jeffrey T Hodge 06/22/2000 02:52 AM 
 Just a reminder that I hope to be out this afternoon (as of this morning my old house closing is set for 3:00 pm, keep your fingers crossed it goes through this time!).   Also, I have morning jury duty tomorrow. 
 You are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision!    Jeffrey T Hodge 06/22/2000 09:03 AM 
 I have prepared a form of transmittal memo for sending the original guarantees down to Credit.  I though you might want to use it as a template. 
 The memo applies to ENA and its other trading affiliates, Enron Canada Corp= .=20 and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.).  If you work for= =20 any of these trading affiliates, this memo would apply to you.  Because of= =20 the constraints of our company wide broadcast system, they could not limit= =20 the email in some offices to only those companies, so we had to send it out= =20 to the whole office.  If you do not work for those companies, this does not= =20 apply to you. 
 Below is my listing of the remaining projects.  1.  Finish painting sunroom. 2.  Paint bedroom furniture. 3.  Replace two front door thresholds. 4.  Put mailbox in Nancy & Peter's front door.  They have the hardware. 5.  Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's. 6.  Paint outdoor pipes same color as house. 7.  I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.  Bob asked if you could replace it for him and send him the bill. 8.  Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom plumbing.  That should do it! 
 Marie,  Obviously, you are not "in the know".  The word on the Enron streets is that Yao is brokering the peace in Bosnia, and that is why he is too busy to call his old friends! 
 Good memo.  I look forward to hearing from you.    Ted Murphy 06/22/2000 04:20 PM 
 I am the person that handles all this.  If you would like to meet to discuss this let me know and we'll set up a time.    Steven J Ehrig@ENRON 06/22/2000 05:51 PM 
 What the NYMEX is trying to get at is their concern that the NYMEX consider= s=20 the trades of ENA and its two other principal trading affiliates (Enron=20 Canada and London) to be one and the same as ENA.

 Marie,  I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.  I thought, "could it be...might it be...?!".  And it was...it was truly he.  I'm sure of it! 
 With respect to Utilicorp, I cannot amend their profile yet to open them for financial until I get the word that everything is set up and ready to go.  We do have the financial master in, so as soon as we figure out how we want to open the accounts, I can send my email.

 I am still getting the chill and it's getting really old.  I've tried to enter into the conversations, make a comment or interact, and I just get frozen out.  It's going to be a long walk over there to help her out.  In  2 weeks, I'm all she's got. 
 Am I supposed to do anything here? 
 I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.  The top of the Schedule says "Milbank Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.  Robina Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.  I would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.  Mark needs the computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in Houston.  Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.  I'd appreciate it. 
 Stephanie rightly pointed out that I was confusing Utilcorp w/Pacific Gas and Electric.  Just call me Roseannaroseannatana!  Attached is the corrected list for 6/20/00 to open Utilicorp for all products except pulp & paper.

 As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced online.  Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already given to the mirrored product.

Our floor is completely full right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to do some shifting.  They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of space.  Something y'all can relate to there in London!

 Anytime!    Stacy E Dickson 06/28/2000 04:46 PM 
 I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware, since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based segments as we add them in the future. 
 Please add Carol St. Clair to the Credit Watch Lists for Houston and Canada.

 Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.  You can see it by clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it says "MG New Cpys".  Ignore the first tab.  I am told by London Legal that our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.  Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.  We've got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.  So unless we hear otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties "read only" access. 
 I just got an updated list.  Please ignore the one I sent you a few minutes ago.

 We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement:  Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  05/15/00  Executed Date:  06/09/00  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  Pacific Gas & Electric Company  Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX  ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  1. DIVISION TRADING.  This counterparty may elect to do additional financial trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its California Gas Transmission Department.  If the Counterparty does elect to trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this master agreement.  No other divisions should be approved for any financial trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from Legal.  However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.  All payments must be treated separately.  It is critical that the PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.  (CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.)  2. Canadian and US Trades:  All financial trades with this counterparty, whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this master agreement.  THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.  3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  When we open them up to trade online, we need to make sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement. Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial product.  3. ONLINE TRADING:  It is critical that  the above information is captured correctly before we can open them up for online trading.  I will verbally confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal approves them to trade online. 
 I say let them eat cake!    Stacy E Dickson 06/29/2000 01:43 PM 
 How should I respond to soybeans?  It is on the list of commodities we might trade. 
 At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the referenced master.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Carol at (713) 853-3989 if you have any comments or questions.  If the amendment meets with your approval, please have two copies executed by an authorized officer of J. Aron and return them to me for signature by Enron.  Thanks for your help! 
 Luanne,  I missed a few of Carol's changes so she asked me to resend the document. Sorry! 
 I don't think your attachment was attached.    "Giessen, Luanne" <luanne.giessen@gs.com> 06/30/2000 08:47 AM 
 I just spoke to John Cameron, the lawyer for the Company and our plan is to email him, an associate of his, and Doug Thomas the draft as soon as it is ready.    I will also fax John Cameron the draft.   Tracy Ngo in Credit is working up the credit, and I am doing as much of the draft as I can pending credit.  Carol St. Clair, a lawyer in our Group here in Houston, will be reviewing the draft.  As this is moving quickly, please provide us with any updates of information.    John Malowney 06/30/2000 09:36 AM 
 We have received the following three amendments to the ETA's, as indicated below:  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan Edison Company  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania Electric Company  Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central Power & Light Company  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have finally received comments on the ISDA from the referenced counterparty.  I have sent copies to each of you.  There were substantial comments to the guaranty so I have sent a copy of the guaranty along with the comments to Clem.  Clem,  congrats on that trophy! 
 You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.  All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it. I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in a construction site.  I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!  Keep in touch...! 
 John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.  She is a lawyer working on the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a paralegal).  Thanks.    "Cameron, John" <johncameron@DWT.COM> 06/30/2000 11:41 AM 
 Thanks for the credit!    Tracy Ngo 06/30/2000 01:03 PM 
 Attached please find a draft of the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement between Bellingham Cold Storage Co. and Enron North America Corp.  Please call Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel, at (713) 853-3989 with any questions or comments you may have.  My direct dial number is (713) 853-3399. 
 You are so very welcome!    John Malowney 06/30/2000 03:13 PM 
 We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.  We found that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.  In the long run we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as the trading markets become more international in nature.  If you prefer the Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to compare the forms and convert the document over.  Please let me know if that is your preference.    "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 06/30/2000 05:15 PM 
 I have scheduled taking Monday and Tuesday July 17 & 18 off to visit my family in New York. 
 Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty is the protected party.  This form needs a little tweaking since it is more directed for a financing transaction.  Peter can find it, as well as other forms, in the attorney forms bank.  Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can be of further help. 
 I spoke to Serge Martin, their outside counsel, and he said it's on his list, but he hasn't been able to get to it.  Maybe in another month... 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated June 28, 2000 wherein Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. ("Assignor") assigned its interest in certain natural gas wholesale and derivatives transactions with Enron North America Corp. to J. Aron & Company ("Assignee").  A copy of the trades being assigned is attached to the assignment which will be distributed to the usual distribution group, plus Bob Klein. 
 I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group.  I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client, the online trading group.  Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us meet the needs of our clients.  Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team! 
 In case you were wondering... 
 I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced counterparty.  I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.  He finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for a lawyer on his side to review it.  He has one comments already I'll run by Mark.  Otherwise, we're waiting for him to get back with his lawyer's comments. 
 We have received the executed Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 30, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.     David Forster@ENRON 07/05/2000 05:01 PM 
 Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)... 
 Boy, was she quick.  We appear to have only one trade to assign, so Credit, I guess you are OK with this, and Bob, you don't show any other crude trades do you? 
 Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in place?  When can we receive copies? 
 Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.  We have the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements:  Limitation of Rate.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party.   For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis.  Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to the above highlighted language?  Thanks for your help. 
 Per Lotus Notes, it looks like Susan Flynn sent them a draft on 5/23 and hasn't heard from them.  The name of the person she sent it to was Adrian Brabham. 
 Mark spoke to Bloomberg and their attorney with Wilkie Farr, and they made substantial revisions to the form.  I just faxed a clean and blacklined draft to them and am waiting to get their approval.  Will you be around to sign? 
 We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with Bloomberg PowerMatch LLC and Bloomberg L.P dated July 6, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Anita,  You were going to fax me the form of assignment...     "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 07/05/2000 06:06 PM 
 Fax no is 713/646-3490.     "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 07/06/2000 06:03 PM 
 Can you send him a copy of this.  Thanks.

 Thanks for your email.  As you aleady appear to be aware, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from tading any products the company trades.   As you may or may not be aware, the products the company trades has expanded beyond energy commodities, we trade interest rates & currencies, pulp & paper, weather, and metals.

 Robbi,  What impact will the advice below have on our Japanese bandwidth approvals? Right now I have them OK to trade the US segment.  Based on the advice below do you think we will need to get a license as a "telecommunications carrier"?  Should I shut Japan down for now?    Robbi Rossi@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/07/2000 08:51 AM 
 We have received the executed amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated June 23, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the pulp & paper trades to that website.  In oder to determine whether any of the counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper online.  Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?  Thanks! 
 Re: the Statoil Assignment  The Statoil master will not be terminated. They sold their existing natgas & crude oil book to J. Aron.  They may trade other products out of that master, or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those products.  So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under the J. Aron master.  Everything else should remain the same. 
 You would need to talk to Mike Moscosco.  I don't know, but perhaps they don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.    Steven J Ehrig@ENRON 07/07/2000 01:36 PM 
 Gene,  As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project Services Agreement in Enron's files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.? 
 I am working with the Click Paper.com lawyers on their online documentation, and they want to see a UK form of financial GTC.  Can you send me one?  As ever, in your debt... 
 Jeff,  We are also usually sent a page from some tax book that show the rate of withholding for each of the treaty countries.  Their rate of withholding will impact which form we may or may not need.  Can you send it to me?  Thanks!    Jeff Blumenthal 07/07/2000 04:53 PM 
 The page out of the book we were sent last year says "Treaty Withholding Tax Rates" , and under it is says "The following are US withholding tax rates for dividend, interest and royalty payments from the United States to residents of various treaty countries.  Then below there it has a list which shows the Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.    Jeff Blumenthal 07/07/2000 05:11 PM 
 Thanks as usual for the prompt response.  You are a star!    Edmund Cooper 07/07/2000 05:41 PM 
 Attached please find the lists referenced above, except the list for 7/6/00. which just has 1 declined counterparty on it. 
 I walked past that office and it still looked a little messy.  Is someone from Prjoect Rock going to clean it out? 
 Below is a new gas product.  Any issues I need to be aware of? 
 Can you send me your form(s) of Password Applications?!  Thanks!  I needed to talk to you about MG, because I am really backed up and have not been able to get to that counterparty list.  What is my drop dead date? 
 Yes, we have an ISDA in place with Georgia Pacific Corporation.    John Malowney 07/11/2000 12:27 PM 
 This counterparty came across on my online list for today.  I took a look at the master you have in your office, and to me it seems to be approved for all products, including weather & pulp & paper, just not FX.  In Susan Flynn's email she said no pulp & paper.  Which is correct? 
 Attached is the referenced amendment.  Please call me or Carol if we can be of further service. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need a Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 In order to get you phone service here, the phone people want your passport number since you don't have a social security number.  Can you provide it to Joyce Dorsey, an assistant here in Legal.  She's working with Sylvia to get your office set up.  Thanks! 
 I don't see that I got a response from Leslie on the above list.  Can you check this one too?  Thanks! 
 I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you? Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!  This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)... 
 I thought that body looked pretty buff!  I should have known it was you.  So you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!    Justin Boyd 07/12/2000 11:16 AM

 London Legal wants to know if this is done? 
 Attached is that RUSH guaranty Stuart Zisman called about.  We need to get it signed today.  We will also need the Certificate with respect to the incumbency of the officer signing the guaranty.  Thanks! 
 Ted,  Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."  Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that language? 
 Attached is the language for insertion in the confirmation.

 I spoke to Tanya and she said they only do energy trading through J. Aron, all the interest rate and currency trading is done through Goldman, so we don't need language re: that business.  Also, I ran it by her, and she does want the language in the credit rating section of the MAC about "not supported by third party credit enhancement." 
 Thanks!.  I'll fax it back to you after it's signed.    "Pete Groetzinger" <pgroetzinger@brentbroker.com> 07/13/2000 07:08 PM 
 It was good seeing you.  Thanks for dinner.  Shawna and I were waiting for your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!), but I guess we missed you for this trip.  She sends her regards!  I harassed Justy about his movie career.  He told me he was the body double for Russell Crowe.  I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!)  Keep me posted on the house.  It looked great! 
 Is this only available to the Legal Group?  There are a few people in Credit and Global Contracts that might find this helpful.  Please add me to the list.  Thanks!    Sylvia Hu@ENRON 07/13/2000 05:51 PM 
 Did you get this? 
 Serge,  That was sent to you yesterday morning.  I guess you didn't get it? 
 Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the referenced counterparty for review.  There is no indication of what Enron business person is interested in this counterparty.  I will forward a copy of the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the contact information.  We won't do anything until we receive a credit worksheet from Credit. 
 None of the counterparties on your Mexico counterparty list should be approved to trade:  any financial product, physical bandwidth, and physical power.  When I get back to the office on Wednesday, I will do up your spreadsheets.  Thanks! 
 Are there any individuals in your group that might find this seminar beneficial? 
 Please keep me on the distribution for all credit worksheets.  Thanks. 
 I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest change question we asked him.  You'll see, he sent us both a fax with proposed changes to that section.  When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.  It wasn't a clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on this. 
 John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in.   I take it that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?  Our usual sample form does not have the governmental provisions.  I would think we would want to send them a sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional provisions in there.  Can you confirm for me that they are a governmental/quasi-governmental?  Also, have you requested credit from Credit?    John Malowney 07/17/2000 11:25 AM

 Please handle.  Thanks! 
 There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity. It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a "dba" (which means "doing business as") or "assumed name" for an incorporated entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples might be "Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division" or "Tana Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company" or "TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones Inc."  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's master.  P.S. Susan Flynn is on an extended leave of absence.     Stacey Richardson 07/20/2000 05:36 PM 
 Deb,  Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is not showing up on the list.  Thanks! 
 In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following information:  1.  The company's full legal name 2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form 3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of transaction is it for) 4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number 5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to talk to them) 
 Bill,  I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out... 
 Per our conversation, attached is the Authorized Trader List.  Can you have Gary review it Monday when he gets back, as we are opening a new brokerage account and we need to provide the list to the brokerage firm. 
 Do you have any updates to the Pulp & Paper group? 
 Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?  If it's not a rush, it makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like "this is not negotiable!".    Savita Puthigai@ENRON 07/21/2000 10:32 AM 
 I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the counterparty.   If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.  1.  Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of Enron Power Marketing  (this would have covered physical power, not financial).  I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is taken care of. 
 Brent Hendry, an attorney that used to be in our group in Houston, then went to Argentina, is now back.  He had review only access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Can you get him added ASAP with full edit capability. Thanks! 
 Scott,  Is there someone else in your group who can get Brent access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database? 
 He has view access, but he doesn't have edit capability, which he needs.    Scott Cleverly 07/21/2000 03:28 PM 
 Below is the initial list of the ClickPaper.com counterparties.  As usual, let me know if you have any issues, otherwise I will consider them approved 1 day after transmittal of the list. 
 We need to set up a new database as soon as possible when you get back.  We have a new online trading system starting Tuesday, ClickPaper.com, and I will need to mirror the Online Trading Database.  Can you call me when you get back. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I understand that the Western Area Power Administration - Upper Great Plain has been bugging us to get opened up for physical power, so you might want to give a rush approval on that one. 
 No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.  You have two on the 7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United States Department of Energy.  Can you please change the name on the accounts.  I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name on to the account.   The people who approve Password Applications should be sorting this out.  Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.  Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 Please note that we are in a dispute with Enage Energy US, LP with respect to power trading, and they are shut down for power trading only until such dispute is resolved.  I have already confirmed this with Stephanie. 
 Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.  In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for document creation more attractive. 
 Thanks Mike!    Michael Neves 07/24/2000 11:25 AM 
 Attached is a revised draft of the Authorized Trader List.  We need to open a pulp & paper brokerage account today, so we will need to get this signed by the end of the day.  Please let me know if Ted has any comments.  If not, I will get it initialled and bring it to Ted for signature.   I am wating to hear from Sara as to whether we should add agricultural to the list.  Per Gary, the list will be the same exact list as financial.  Thanks! 
 Mary Cook signed off with a few minor changes.  Attached is the amendment with the revised numbers.  Please check them and let me know if they are OK. 
 FYI, 
 We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.  We do have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.  I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).  We will await Credit's instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the documentation. 
 At the request of Bill Bradford in our Credit Department, I am attaching our proposed amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement between HS Resources, Inc. and Enron North America.  Please let me know if the amendment meets with your approval.  My phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Tana L. Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look these dates up?    Bernice Rodriguez 07/24/2000 05:31 PM 
 It is in my "forms" subdirectory, called "questionnaire-umbrella re internet trading1.doc.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 07/24/2000 06:05 PM 
 I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2. The contact is Theresa Pace (French pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.  I spoke to Harry Arora about it, and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.  So when you have a minute, let's talk about what to do. 
 Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES. 
 Gosh, I'm getting so good at this I might not need you anymore...did I not see that one coming or what!    Leslie Hansen 07/25/2000 10:00 AM 
 Jeff,  Would you handle this or would Alan, or both of you? 
 Below is John's contact as Boeing.  He would like to get some credit so we can get this counterparty an ISDA.  I understand that you are under the gun today, if you could just let us know when we might be able to get some credit.  Much thanks! 
 Mark,  I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney. I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your direction as to how I should handle this.  I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone number is 713/853-3399. 
 I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list Credit sent me).  One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical power.  Like the other European based physical power products, it should not be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a particular one).  Is that OK with you.  Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit opened them up for all financial power).  I had already opened them up for all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  There are only 2 counterparties for approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.  Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add financial power.  I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products with utilities under Virginia law.  Notes in our database reflect that this was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.  I have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to resolve this directly with them.  Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas Company, and that needs to be made part of the name. 
 I still need to see you about that Market Disruption summary for the Husky Oil Global Contract Datasheet so I can close up that file. 
 At the request of Andy Zipper, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any comments or questions. 
 Alan & Harry  Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know. 
 Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp. was originally shut down for financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.  Since then, we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental utilities.  Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp. (and moved the Aquila trades under it).  Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp. for all financial products. 
 The referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical and financial products offered online.  I am not sure if we need to see this counterparty come through again as a Click Paper counterparty or not.  I'll let Tom decide.   For me, I'm OK. 
 David,  A clarification...  On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a correct interpretation?    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/25/2000 06:01 PM 
 It is OK to sign the copy I emailed to you.  Just return the signed copy  to me via fax 713/646-3490 and I will get is signed by an authorized officer here and return it to you.  In your fax please tell me who you would like me to send the return fax to.  Thanks for your prompt attention with this! 
 I have already responded to the counterparty.    Savita Puthigai@ENRON 07/26/2000 03:37 PM 
 Done at last!  Whew, I'm whooped!  Now it's your turn to have fun! Unfortunatel, I have a call into David Minns about one issue, and I hope when he responds it doesn't change my approvals... 
 Per our conversation last night, can you take a look at my list of country product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the information.  Thanks. 
 Try talking to Nadeem Tufail in London.  I believe he is a paralegal that is responsible for their corporate filings. 
 Leslie,  On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.  I have no record on PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even though it says amended.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I am still waiting on 1 response for the list from the 24th. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated 7/26/00.  Copies will be sent to Andy Zipper and a copy to Dave Samuels for the files. 
 Mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a Confidentiality Agreement for the Houston Chronicle.  What's the scoop there? 
 Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we offer newprint commodity swaps and options online. 
 The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions." In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types of products they are approved to do with us. 
 Anthony, I have no idea what that questions means...    Anthony Campos 07/27/2000 02:35 PM 
 Attached please find Deemed ISDA. 
 I forgot one thing.  I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or whatever it is, and then painting that.  Do you remember?  By the way, I can't believe you're alive.  By the way you've been quiet, I thought you were maybe in that plane too...! 
 Holly,  Attached is a sample incumbency certificate.        "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 07/25/2000 11:10 AM 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:   Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, attached is our form of Letter of Credit. 
 Holly,  Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine.  Frequently, companies do not know who will be available to sign, so they list more than one signer.    "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 07/28/2000 04:49 PM 
 We have received and executed Master Agreement:   Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   April 28, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.   Counterparty:   Kinder Morgan, Inc.  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp & Paper Foreign Exchange 
 Holly, I already mailed the documents out to meet the Fedex deadline.  Can you substitute these pages out later, or hand write the changes?    "Mitchell, Holly" <hollymitchell@dwt.com> 07/28/2000 05:31 PM 
 Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.  It appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any, has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict metals trading. 
 Mr. Faragalla,  I am checking on your review of the Confdientiality Agreement referenced in our earlier email below.   When might we expect to hear some comments from you?  Please let me know. 
 Mr. Finzi,  We have heard back from you regarding the Confidentiality Agreement referenced below.  Can you please let me know when we might expect your comments?  Thank you. 
 That's the point, it wasn't on my list!  I remembered when I was standing there looking at the garden and saw the rotted board.  Also, there is a skootch of repainting that needs to be done on the same garage wall.  You didn't tell me the bathroom you were working on for your other "client" was Michelle's! 
 As a follow-up to my memo re: tax treaty countries, I called Jeff Blumenthal about Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania & Venezuela, since they were not on the list and in a separate memo, and he said that they adopted tax treaties after the Tax Code binder was published. 
 I take it by PG&E Core, you mean PG&E's Core Procurement Department.  Yes, it should go out under the master    Sheetal Patel 07/31/2000 01:56 PM 
 I need to hear back from anyone whose group may be trading with this counterparty.  Here's my issue.  We have been negotiating an amendment to the Password Application with this counterparty.  The absolutely refuse to see a GTC.  I don't know if any of you are trading gas, crude or power with them, but if you are, do you have a master, or would the counterparty see a GTC.  I'm trying to figure out what we have before we talk to them.  Thanks! 
 We have this down for signature right now.  We hope to get it out today.    John Pavetto@ENRON 07/31/2000 03:00 PM 
 Yeah, it won't go away!    Stacy E Dickson 07/31/2000 03:32 PM 
 We have received comments from the referenced counterparty with respect to comments to an Annex A to a Confirmation.  Mary Cook, a new attorney in our Group, will be working on this. 
 Remember, on the divisions, to make the incorporated entity name part of the counterparty's name! 
 No.    Tanya Rohauer 08/01/2000 10:26 AM 
 Getting back to the original questions.  Do you trade with this counterparty and do you trade pursuant to a master or a GTC? 
 I know you are just a spy so she can keep track of the progress of my garden.  Why, just the other day I came home from work and caught her in my backyard!! 
 Have you heard from The Houston Chronicle? 
 Do you want me to follow up with them?    Louise Kitchen 08/01/2000 11:33 AM 
 Is there someone in our group that is working on this.  I looked in Lotus Notes and didn't find any entry for this. 
 Is someone from our group working on this? 
 John,  Mark left a message for you yesterday.  He needs to discuss this comment with you.  Can you please call him.  Thanks! 
 fyi 
 Dave,  Leslie Hansen is going to review your NDA.  Her number is x36121.    Dave Samuels 08/01/2000 03:32 PM 
 I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement on the gas side to see what you've done before.  Debbie Brackett says she knows what agreement you're talking about.  I'll keep you posted. 
 Fix all!  I need to tell Peter and Nancy when you'll be in their apartment. 
 Carol,  Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.  It is not clear to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK. It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.  What do I need to do here?  Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some hand marked changes.  Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should sign?  Hope all is going well...    Carol St Clair 07/19/2000 12:54 PM 
 With respect to your inquiry as to whether there was any assignment executed with respect to the assignment of the Howard trades to TXU, I looked in the file and it appears that Susan Bailey in our Group prepared an Assignment and Termination Agreement which she passed on the Brant Reves in Credit on 1/6/00 for handling.  There is no record of this assignment ever being executed in our records. 
 Brenda,  I am forwarding this email to you, because attached to the bottom is a presentation that Mark wants to copy to put slides in his presentation. 
 Nella,  Do you have a master agreement in place with Pacific Gas & Electric if you trade with them, or do you trade under GTC's? 
 Who at the West Desk should I speak to?  We don't usually talk with the physical traders. 
 Stephanie,  Can you provide Travis, the ClickPaper lawyer, with a copy of the Japanese ETA? 
 Please fax the signed agreement to 713/646-3490.  If you have any questions call me at 713/853-3399.  Thanks.    "George Emerson" <gemerson@sportsrocket.com> 08/03/2000 09:07 AM Please respond to gemerson 
 I looked thru the attached 10K for NSTAR and could find no "NSTAR Companies" entity listed there.  Maybe you'll have better luck, or are smarter and will find it (since I failed so miserably on you know what today!). 
 Yes, you can fax me the invoice and statement. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:  7/31/00 List - I am not opening up Equitable Gas Company, because it does not say a division of Equitable Resources Inc.  I thought that was our deal. 8/1/00 List- I cannot review NSTAR Companies yet.  There is some question as to whether that is a correct legal entity. 
 Anyone know anything about this? 
 All's I need now is your email w/instructions. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with Spear, Leeds & Kellogg dated July 31, 2000.  A copy will be sent to John Pavetto and to Dave Samuels for the files. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 04/18/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I will redo the 7/31/00 list with the Equitable approval.    Stephanie Sever 08/04/2000 10:24 AM 
 Credit wants to open up the referenced counterparty immediately.  They are approved to trade all physical products, except physical power, and can trade all financial.  I will follow up with this counterparty profile on today's approvals. 
 Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July. Please let me know if the changes meet with your approval. 
 Sure.  Maybe after running we could get cleaned up and go take a look.  Do you still want to go to the movies?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 08/04/2000 03:18 PM 
 Today after work would be fine if you want to?!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 08/04/2000 05:22 PM 
 Tracy, is there some particular reason I'm getting this notice?   Debra Perlingiere is the paralegal that does the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements. 
 Attached is the referenced amendment.  Let me know if it meets with your approval.  Make sure you check my numbers. 
 I've got  several European counterparties on my 8/3/00 ClickPaper Online List, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and France.  Are there any restrictions on trading financial pulp & paper in Europe?  Everything going well...? 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   July 28, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:   Bellingham Cold Storage Co.  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Foreign Exchange 
 Bob,  John Viverito, an attorney from Houston who is temporarily in Japan setting up our Japanese trading office, is looking for the templates for confirmations for US weather and pulp and paper confirmations.  Can you send the confirmations to him.  Thanks! 
 Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up with the online team for some reason.    Mary Griff Gray 08/07/2000 08:44 AM 
 Just an heads up, they are open to trade physical power, which I expect is what they want to trade, but not financial.    Mary Griff Gray 08/07/2000 09:00 AM 
 Yes, the only weather representations we need are now always covered in the confirmation.  As far as thru what entity they trade, I support whatever Lotus Notes says.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 08/07/2000 09:05 AM 
 Dave,  This should do it...       David Forster@ENRON 08/04/2000 07:51 PM 
 Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.    Mary Griff Gray 08/07/2000 09:33 AM 
 We have a new paralegal starting in our group today, Stephanie Panus.  Can you get her full access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  Thanks! 
 Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master? 
 Below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes. Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving). Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need to know where they are located.  Justin Boyd, London Edmund Cooper, London Mark Elliott, London Paul Simons, London Peter Keohane, Calgary Martin Rosell, Oslo Matthis Lee, Singapore David Minns, Australia John Viverito, Japan 
 I thought this was what we were already doing.  Sara, Mark, wasn't that your understanding?    Brent Hendry@ENRON 08/07/2000 10:45 AM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated as of August 1, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels for the files. 
 Can you handle this? 
 And here I thought you were inviting me to a barbecue!    Mary Cook 08/07/2000 12:46 PM 
 Per your request. 
 Thanks Edmund.  You're the best!    Edmund Cooper 08/07/2000 02:04 PM 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Please note the following:  James Hardie N.V. is a Netherlands counterparty.  They can enter into swap transactions only, no options.  As we expand the product list, we will have to note this. Societe Industrielle de Transports Automobile:  I have them shut down for now until I speak to the London office tomorrow about bankruptcy/setoff issues in France. 
 What do you mean "Happy Hour"?!  How can we be happy when we're losing our Erica!! 
 I looked in the Lotus Notes database, and I didn't see anything about this. Unless Susan is working on this, I know nothing...    Larry Joe Hunter 08/08/2000 10:17 AM 
 The Assignment and Amendment to the Assignment was faxed to Vangie McGilloway and the orginals are being fedexed to her tonight.  A copy is being sent to Tracy. 
 We have received the executed Second Amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of July 31, 2000.  This amendment changes the Counterparty's exposure Threshold and exempts certain Transactions when calculating "Exposure" under Paragraph 3 of the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I left a message with both Clement Abrams and his paralegal, Carol Essig, about the information you are requesting.  I told them you needed an immediate response.  If you don't hear from them within the next 1/2 hour let me know. 
 What is this attached list?  Have I seen it before?    Camille Gerard@ENRON 08/08/2000 06:07 PM 
 Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties. Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling people without my systems in place! 
 With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into newsprint swaps and options only.  At this time our list does not reflect the individual products you are trading.  I understand from Mark Taylor that he spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as this one will occur from time to time. 
 At Mark Taylor's direction, I have revised the Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement form to add a new Paragraph 2 with respect to keeping the discussions confidential.  A copy is attached for your files. 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  A few things to note:  On the 8/7/00 List:  Papier Masson, LTEE can transact all pulp and papers swaps, but not options (when we have them).  On the 8/8/00 List:  Globe Building Materials, Inc. has been shut down from trading financial since they are currently not an eligible swap participant ("ESP") in their own right.  However, getting a letter of credit in place would make them an ESP, and Credit has requested a letter of credit from them.  As soon as they receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for re-approval. 
 On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new counterparty.  On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read: City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department. the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C. 
 I just wanted to confirm that your records show the referenced counterparty closed for power...? 
 With the forms relocation, forms list.doc needs to be revised to reflect their new location. 
 I have gotten a phone call from Hydro-Quebec checking on the status of this. Can we expect a credit worksheet for an ISDA comparison? 
 I'm going to try someone else. 
 In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.  The City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are the City of Huntsville, AL.  This isn't going to be a problem with my financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.  The same would apply to counties.  So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of the counterparty name.  Leslie, do you have any problem w/Huntsville, let me know? 
 Attached is the referenced list.  Please see the change for power on Turlock.  I will be out of the office Friday and Monday. 
 Just a followup, Stephanie needs full access ASAP.  Can you let her know when her access is granted.  Thanks! 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated July 27, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I have redone the attached list to open up Equitable for everything but physical power. 
 Mark Taylor asked me to respond to your request about the OMLX  software.  I spoke to Mark Elliott in our London office who dealt directly with the OMLX. He said to contact Susan Gill at the OMLX, who we spoke to on the agreements, and she should be able to direct you to their software people.  Her number in London is 011 44 171 815 8510.  Let me know if I can be of further service. 
 No, the City of Huntsville is not approved for financial trading  or physical power.  FYI< with the US based customer list (online and offline), we will never approve a governmental entity for financial trading unless we have a master in place, or time to do some due diligence on their authority to enter into financial transactions.

 I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).  With such an increase in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!  The White House may become an option... 
 I just got in from Aspen.  This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's birthday.  Is Holly going, she might like to...?  In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.  It seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to be careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...  As far as not hearing back from Enron.  I wouldn't think anything of it. They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from them for two months.  Big companies have lots of layers to get anything done.

 No response yet.  I have a call into Credit to discuss what entities we want to trade with. 
 Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies that can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access this information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an online search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company that can verify this information for us?  I appreciate your help. 
 We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of July 5, 2000.  This amendment changes the Material Adverse Change Clause in the Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.

 Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that this is a credit derivatives counterparty.    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/15/2000 05:32 PM

 1.  What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?  I think that should be "Credit Derivatives".  2.  Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list, since I never have any responses from those groups.  3.  I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.  4.  Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for "EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".  I will maintain my approvals for each of those separate online trading databases in the same database.  5.  I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".  Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush from last week done....  As usual, your help is always appreciated! 
 Nella Cappalleto has early retired from the Calgary office.  In your distribution memos for signed documents, copies of Canadian agreements were previously sent to Nella.  Please send them to Peter Keohane's new assistant, Sharon Crawford.

 Thanks to you and Scott for your help, I appreciate it!  I hope all is going well... 
 Mike,  Checking on the status of getting Stephanie Panus, a new paralegal in our Group, full edit access to the referenced database.  Also, we need to get some additional people full edit access:  Matt Dawson, who just started in London Legal, and David Minns, a lawyer in our Australia office.  Can you let me and each of these people know when they have access.  Thanks! 
 Camille, you're not waiting on anything from me to resolve the "Bakersfield Californian Issue", are you? 
 With respect to the attached list, a few things:  1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know if your approvals reflect otherwise?  2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company: Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading arm, so that entity name should be left alone.  I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from Australia about a question. 
 Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?  For online, what I daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading legal groups.  Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's list.  I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties. Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).   I understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process may get more complex.  Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you? 
 Can you put this on my calendar.  Thanks.    Taffy Milligan 08/16/2000 06:47 PM 
 Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will not be approving them to trade financial products.  As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.  If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet this test.  At your direction I will handle this in this manner.  How would you like me to proceed?     David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/16/2000 07:58 PM 
 Justin,  I approved Powercor to trade before I left last night.  By copy of this email to our online team here, I will be notifying them of your concern that this counterparty is opened to trade when you arrive at work today in Australia.    Justin.Timothy@ect.enron.com 08/17/2000 12:24 AM 
 John,  Here is the list from yesterday.  On a going forward basis I will just add you to my distribution, and there will usually be no message from me unless we have a RUSH approval or some other info I need to communicate. 
 The online team called and they would like a rush approval for Duke Energy Merchants LLC.  In particular, this counterparty would like to trade European physical coal.  Please let me know as soon as possible whether you have any problems with this counterparty. 
 Just to keep you in the loop on things.  Lee sent me the following email and I'm following up trying to figure this out.  I spoke to Debbie Brackett in our Credit Dept. when I got back from London and she seemed to be aware of the contract Lee has been talking about.  I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement from Debbie so I can figure this out.  I'll keep you posted.  How are things going there?  Same old grind?! 
 Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll keep you posted. 
 No problema!    Robert Bruce@ENRON Sent by: Robert Bruce@ENRON 08/17/2000 09:14 AM 
 David,  Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system.  This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front.  In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.  Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.  For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading.  For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have found helpful.  You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..  Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you. 
 I heard back from the coal lawyers.  Duke is approved to trade all coal. 
 Mark Taylor just heard that Edmund is very sick and has been out for quite awhile.  What's the scoop?  Is he in the hospital, will he continue to be out, is there someplace we can send flowers?  Can you let me know what's going on.  Thanks! 
 Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather online.  However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only covers energy commodities.  I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the master agreement.   I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.  So, they are OK to open for weather. 
 Can you please have the Password Application amended to set up the counterparty as I have indicated.  Then tell Global Contracts it is done. 
 Per Leslie Hansen, the name above is the way the Town of Braintree, Massachusetts is setting up their power contract, so this is the way we should open them up for EOL. 
 I have already responded in my initial email.  For whatever reason, the counterparty trades physical gas as "Nicor Gas Company".  They trade financial as indicated below.    It is now up to EOL to get back with the counterparty and get them to amend the Password Applcation.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 08/17/2000 11:04 AM 
 We have received the First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated  as of July 1, 2000 ("Amendment").  This Amendment (1) amends Counterparty's Threshold under the Credit Suport Annex, (2) exempts certain Transactions when determining "Exposure" under the ISDA Master Agreement, and (3) changes the Fixed Price with respect to the "Exempt Transactions" reflected in the Amendment.  Copies will be distributed. 
 There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading with these entities.  We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not set up this way it need to be.  Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.  The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.  When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.  Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too. 
 Per the memo below, we are looking for European and Canadian corporate search companies, and it occurred to me that you may already have someone you use. Do you have any recommendations?  Thanks for your help! 
 I approved this counterparty with US EOL this morning to trade all coal including European coal.    Edmund Cooper 08/17/2000 04:09 PM 
 Edmund,  I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea. What's the scoop?  Should I be worried? 
 Per the email below, it appears to me physical gas should be traded only under Nicor Gas Company and financial through the dba.  Do you agree? 
 I had a hernia two years ago.  It's not fun.  Mine didn't sound as bad as your does, though.  You haven't been having a good year.  I hope things improve.    Edmund Cooper 08/17/2000 04:22 PM

 In addition to granting full edit access to David Minns in our Australia office, he has also required that Alison Keogh and Rob McGrory in his office be granted access.  Can you let them know when they have full edit capability.  Thanks 
 I think if once you get full access  you could have your assistant plug in the required data for on each ISDA Master in place or draft you have out to counterparties.  When you come here I would like to spend just a little time going over some of the data and the reporting funtions.

 I am getting ready to fax you the Cancellation Agreement which has been executed by an officer of ECT.  I have two originally executed copies which I would like to overnight to you for execution and I need your address.  Can you please email it back to me.  Much thanks! 
 Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".  Upon receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I will contact Credit and the Online team.    Stacey Richardson 08/17/2000 04:49 PM

 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching a clean and blacklined draft of the Schedule and Credit Support Annex to the referenced ISDA Master Agreement.  Can you please provide or confirm the following information:  (1) since the Counterparty is Australian, I have added the Counterparty's ACN Number to the document.  Can you please provide that number to us.  (2) Can you take a look at the definition of "Obligors" in the Credit Support Annex and let us know if it references the correct Obligors under the Loan Agreement.  Since I will not be in the office this afternoon, can you please call Sara at (713) 853-5620 or Stephanie Panus at (713) 345-3249 with your comments. Thanks for your attention herewith. 
 Per my conversation with Leslie, it is OK to open this counterparty for all US physical power. 
 You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by Enron North America too?

 Shari,  To save you some time in the future, if a counterparty says "declined" on the worksheet, you don't even have to look at it at all, because it means Credit has decided not to trade with them.    Shari Stack 08/24/2000 03:00 PM 
 I am forwarding a copy of Leslie's email, as a sample for you.  I input Leslie's responses in my EOL Legal Database, so I can keep track, product by product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date. If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is changing an earlier approval.  Further, I put Leslie's notes about any particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online GTC", or whatever.  Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing. 
 I need a quick reply on a ClickPaper counterparty below.  If I do not hear from you I will take it that it is OK.

 Oh guru of all things Canadian...  I'm working on comments to an ISDA that Hydro-Quebec sent us for an affiliate, HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., which is a Delaware corporation. Is there anything special about Hydro-Quebec being the Guarantor, or just the usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor?  By the way, I hope you're coming up for the Legal Conference.  There are many problems at Enron that need our help in getting sorted out, those kinds of problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out!  I'm counting on you! 
 You are a star!  When are you going to get back to Houston?  There's problems going on right and left at Enron I think we need to solve! 
 I'll go for that picking up the cigarettes off the floor thing, it seemed somewhat unsanitary anyway.  But if you get so wimpy that you can't survive a drink or two with your buddy down south of the border (female at that!)...well, we need to toughen you up man!  Repeat after me:  "PARTY, PARTY, PARTY!!!"    Peter Keohane 08/28/2000 06:02 PM 
 John, no we do not have an ISDA in place with Wah Chang.  Do you want me to pass your request on to Credit?    John Malowney 08/28/2000 06:21 PM 
 My assignment related only to financial transactions.  So it would not be power deals.    Melissa Ann Murphy 08/29/2000 09:04 AM 
 The list of trades was attached to the assignment.  Jeff Sorenson should have a copy down there.    Melissa Ann Murphy 08/29/2000 09:38 AM 
 Can you provide Melissa with a copy of the recent assignment we entered into.  I think it should already be in the blue file.  Thanks. 
 Souad,  We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you.  And the guarantees (when we get them) should work for allfinancial transactions.    Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 08/29/2000 10:27 AM 
 Melissa,  We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.  Is that our standard convention?  Thanks for your help!  P.S.  I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my assistant Taffy Milligan.  She can get you copies of any documents in the future. 
 We've got a draft master with the following rounding conventions:  Short tons: zero decimals Temperatures:  zero decimals US Dollar Amounts:  to the nearest cent  Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions?  P.S.  Do you get a invite to our favorite email person's political swankienda? 
 I've been trying to get Clickpaper to expand their product approval list to match the products they offer...maybe your request will help!    Karen Lambert 08/29/2000 01:34 PM 
 Mike,  How can Brent get access to our Master Swap Agreement database from EI in Argentina?  Thanks for your help. 
 Thanks for your help anyway.  I'll just cross out kilowatts, they already had megawatts in there.    Melissa Ann Murphy 08/29/2000 01:54 PM 
 I live to corrupt young, unsuspecting lawyers...    Peter Keohane 08/29/2000 03:06 PM 
 I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.  When you send your approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian products only, or all products.  Thanks! 
 Are they approval for ALL products, or only Australian products?    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/29/2000 04:47 PM 
 I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online.  What I am being told is that the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online trading.  It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships. The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency relationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some specific documentation that she got signed.  But I am told should not be entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than principals, except under extraordinary circumstances.    Shari Stack 08/29/2000 05:04 PM 
 It looks like you will need to get whatever documentation Leslie had sign for those in place with these.  I know she has this problem with the service companies to the utilities. 
 Attached is a revision to the list I just sent you, revised to reflect that the last two Australian counterparties can only trade the Australian products Credit listed. 
 Can you fix this on my calendar?  Thanks! 
 Just a heads up:  I am sending up an ISDA Master tonight between ECC and Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership for signature of a Canadian officer.  Yours ever, 
 I am going to have more names to give you from Argentina.  Actually, I need to give access to a number of people to different areas of the swap database.  I am in a seminar the rest of today, but when I get back I'll email you or give you a call about the access. 
 I have an eye dr. appt. tomorrow at 3:00.  I'll have to leave a little early. 
 Attached please find the referenced Annex B and copy of transmittal fax. 
 At Mark Taylor's request, I am attaching Leslie Hansen's form of override letter when a GTC will "override" the master agreement for online transactions.  How are you doing Justy? 
 Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so they can start trading when she's out.  She seems to feel the way the ETA is written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use caused by their fault or negligence.  Can you call her at 215/684-6630. Thanks. 
 Camille Gerard.    Karen Lambert 08/31/2000 11:08 AM 
 Per the emails below, it appears you are looking for the Legal and Privacy Statement.  Mark T. said Leslie just revised it for the online team.  Leslie is on vacation until the 9th, but I think attached below may be the latest draft.  It is located in her "Online" subdirectory, under "Phase 2". 
 Rhonda,  Can you provide me with the Agency Agreement or other documentation you may have received with respect to this agency relationship.  Thanks!    Rhonda L Denton 08/29/2000 05:18 PM 
 With respect to the referenced List: 1.  Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's direction 2.  Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.  If they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to contact them & get evidence of their FERC license. 3.  Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate more this agency thing.  It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we just need more info. 
 Alan Aronowitz is working on a presentation he has to give in Singapore on Global Energy Derivatives, and wanted to put a little blurb in of some kind about weather.  He wanted to see if he could get a copy of the presentation you and Mike Corbally gave at the ISDA seminar to see if there were any slides that might be helpful for his presentation.  Do you have a copy I can provide him?  Thanks! 
 I must have missed your promotion.  Congratulations!  Atttached is the certificate so you do not have to retype it.      Peter Keohane 08/31/2000 06:07 PM 
 Where are y'll moving to?    Rhonda L Denton 08/31/2000 03:59 PM 
 I originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power.  Are we sure it is not a FERC approved marketer? 
 On the attached list, Alliant Energy Corporation is coming back thru to be opened for East power, and the power lawyers are telling me they don't have a FERC license.  If they really want to trade power I will need a name and phone number so our power lawyers can talk to them. 
 Then, I'll stick with what I told the EOL team.  If they really want to trade power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why they think they can trade power.  Otherwise, it stays as a "no".    Shari Stack 09/01/2000 09:09 AM 
 Just a head's up.  Dave finally got the amendment to the ETA signed, so I am fedexing it out to the counterparty today. 
 Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph: 734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056): POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions). MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like to change the master user. 
 When you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the file.  Thanks. 
 I keep trying to email them, but it won't go thru.  Maybe this time...    michael.mulligan@americas.bnpparibas.com 09/01/2000 02:24 PM 
 The ISDA Multicurrency Agreement Schedule has been approved and moved into the attorney forms bank.  It is located at o:legal\atty.fms\swaps\current forms\isda-multicurrency.doc.  The old ISDA Multicurrency Agreement Schedule is located at o:legal\atty.fms\swaps\old forms\old2101a#4.doc. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/2/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 With respect to Ameren Services Company, my notes say I originally had them for power buys ONLY, so I just want to make sure that my "amended-no change" still reads power the same way. 
 Bill Bradford called this morning and wants to put Duetsche Bank on the front burner.  He has been speaking to them and wants to set up a conference call later this week to resolve the remaining issues.  It appears that Carol was working on this master.  Bill wants to know what lawyer will be picking this up, hopefully sometime this morning, so he can set up the conference call. If you let me know who can work on it I'll track down the file for you... 
 The icon below should get you in to the database. 
 Thanks Scott!    Scott Tackett@ENRON 09/05/2000 03:21 PM 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 Mark and I made some changes to conform the confidentiality provisions in the ISDA and Industrial Master Agreements that he wants me to run by you, (1) adding financial institutions to ISDA (or deleting from Industrial), and (2) adding same language to ISDA that we added to Industrial "...and each of such persons" auditors, attorneys, etc. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 4, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Shari,  I've got them shut down for power.  They were one of the counterparty's on the initial approval lists.  The online team tells me we are trading power with them off line, so what's the scoop?  Can they trade power? 
 Travis,  The lastest trading/online memo is in my subdirectory, tjones/forms/questionnaire Umbrella Re-Internet Trading 1cln.doc. 
 Are you shutting down their trading today? 
 I am going to have to leave a skooch early on Friday, at 4 pm. 
 I looked in our financial agreement database and ECTRIC does not have a master in place with either of those entities.  London Legal sent a draft to Credit Lyonnais in March of 1999, but there appears to be no activity under that master.  Credit Lyonnais has a master styled "Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) with Enron North America, under which we trade interest rate, currencies & equities, and Toronto Dominion has master in place with Enron North America and one with Enron Gas and Petrochemicals Trading Limited, an English corp., and a subsidiary of ECTRIC (however, I do not have a copy and do not know if this is a limited purpose master or not), but nothing for either of these entities under ECTRIC.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if I can be of further service    Philippe Penet 09/06/2000 12:40 PM 
 I knew it was Canadian and started with a "T".  Am I good or what!?!  When you get to be my age you'll have no memory left.  Sure wish you were down here enjoying these 109+ degree days with us.  It'll make you appreciate Calgary in Winter.    Peter Keohane 09/06/2000 01:06 PM 
 I just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you.  My usual source for getting the ETA's is out, and I'm trying to track down someone else who can send them to me...    Travis McCullough 09/05/2000 08:04 PM 
 Any updates on Louisville Gas & Electric and LCRA? 
 Tanya called and asked me to get ready for Catalytica, and prepare the Annex B, pending approval of the deal.  I have it ready and am just waiting to hear we're ready to send it down. 
 Can I attend? 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under a financial confirmation.  We will need the standard executed copy.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 Have you heard anything back from Gas Natural with respect to getting their signed guarantees on the Comercializadora Metrogas  and Gas Natural Mexico trades?  I've been holding my Enron Guarantees as leverage in getting theirs.  We are at the period in the confirms where we need to exchange guarantees... 
 When you get back in we need to talk about this cpy.  My records had them shut down for power, they called about contract issue and wanting to trade in all products areas, and speaking to Shari and checking your notes, you had them as open.  Since they haven't traded power yet, I had Frank shut them down until I confirm with you they're OK and under what contracts.  Talk to you when you get back... 
 Tana Jones -XL    Linda J Noske 09/06/2000 01:48 PM 
 FYI 
 John,  Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.  Re:  sample master agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to send out sample masters.  What appears to be happening is that a customer gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being incredibly longer once credit is added.  If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?  Let me know your thinking...    John Malowney 08/23/2000 10:20 AM 
 I just got another call from Sandy Steffen, and she would like, if possible, to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups, so they can be set up to trade by tomorrow.   She also expressed an interest espectially today  in NATURAL GAS.   After talking to her can you let me know under what contract and/or limitations they can trade.  Thanks  It appears she has only heard back from the online team 
 Taffy, I just spoke to Marie and she needs a set.  Also, take Susan Flynn and Jason Peters off your distribution.    Taffy Milligan 09/07/2000 11:02 AM 
 We have received a copy of an executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated July, 20, 1999, as amended August 3, 1999, effective on August 12, 1999, wherein Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. assigned certain transactions to J. Aron and Company.  A copy of the assignment will be distributed. 
 Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have masters in place with. 
 Where did Souad go?    Larry Joe Hunter 09/07/2000 12:15 PM 
 The 12 month restriction isn't coming from Legal, it's coming from Credit. You need to contact Tom Moran.    Kathy M Moore 09/07/2000 01:43 PM 
 I checked the Corporate Database and it's not listed at all.  Maybe Brad knows...    Larry Joe Hunter 09/07/2000 01:49 PM 
 Per Credit, Charlie Hoang on the Confirm Desk needs an Enron Corp. guaranty of the attached physical pulp & paper deal.  I told Credit that your group handles physical P&P. 
 Can you please send a copy of the executed master and any amendments thereto to David Dupre on the Confirm Desk.  Thanks!  (watch out, there are 2 David Dupres!) 
 Yes, to North America, Australia and Japan.    Karen Lambert 09/07/2000 04:30 PM 
 With respect to the referenced list, my instructions from power was to shut down Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Lower Colorado River Authority from both execute and view status for power.  With respect to Lower Colorado River Authority and bandwidth, I spoke to the Broadband team, and they haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth, so they are running it by outside counsel (who happens to be in Singapore this week), and will get back to me.  So until I hear otherwise, I am shutting them down for bandwidth. 
 We have dinner reservations for Tuesday the 24th at 7:30 pm. 
 Yes, I've prepared the assignment, I am just waiting for the lawyer to sign off on it.    Mary Griff Gray 09/08/2000 07:25 AM 
 Andrea Hauser w/EnronOnline called and said that Marathon has a problem with the terms of the online GTC's (default language) for LPG, petrochems, and refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers.   Marathon's lawyer is Rhonda Stinemyer and her # is 713/296-2408.  Can you let Andrea know who will be handling this.  Thanks. 
 Sure!    Mary Griff Gray 09/08/2000 10:08 AM 
 Please note new products.  Let me know if you have any issues or concerns with any of these. 
 I'm getting ready right now to fax it over to Meg.    Mary Griff Gray 09/08/2000 10:08 AM 
 At the request of Sara, I am attaching the ETA.  I am also sending the PA, just in case... 
 I just got a call from Kevin Meredith on the Confirm Desk and it appears that the referenced internal entities have done a trade yesterday and have done other trades in the past and we need to get a master in place.  Can you send us up some credit.  Much thanks. 
 Per emails below, Mike Robison, attorney (x36667) and Nony Flores, Paralegal (x37541) will handle. 
 Thanks for your help!    Dan J Hyvl 09/12/2000 08:15 AM 
 Just a reminder that if you change any of the resolutions contained in our Swap Resolutions Notebook, you need to update the Index, and substitute the revised resolutions into each of the Swap Group's persons Notebooks.  These would include for any of the trading companies, the resolutions that approve what we trade (which also includes who can sign the appropriate documents), as well as the brokerage approval resolutions.  It does not include the Confirmation signatories. 
 Mary Lynne,  These notices will be coming by email on a going forward basis. 
 Will alan handle this? 
 It's back dated to the oldest outstanding trade with the counterparty.    Clement Abrams@ENRON 09/08/2000 04:31 PM

 Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...!  We were in the process of revising our form, so I just have to draft up an Canadian version of the sample ISDA master and get yoou a draft.  I'll try and get to it the next day or two.    Greg Johnston 09/12/2000 03:23 PM 
 I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master competition.   I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the outcome of this race.  Could such slanderous allegations be true? 
 Upon further reflection of the undue influence you have attempted in the past and are currently attempting (need we forget you trying to get Bob Crane not to sign my agreements!), it seems like you have a lack of confidence in your abilities and are therefore unable to run a clean race! 
 Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the Interest Rate and Currency Desk.  If possible, we would also like them to see the comments screen.  The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.  As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.  Can you keep me posted on their access.  Thanks! 
 Here is a picture of Alicia's baby.  It really is a pretty baby! 
 Attached is the referenced list.  No problems with this counterparty. 
 Per attached email from Leslie, can you open this counterparty up for all power.  Thanks! 
 I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based weather confirmations.  As soon as I have that information available, I will plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.  Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of approved jurisdictions for derivatives.  Is it ready yet?  Can I get a copy of it?  I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.  Thanks! 
 Did I mention Andrea Calo in Argentina needs a set? 
 Need to know the scoop on City of Roseville and Puget Sound... 
 Joe,  I got a call from the Coral people that a corrected confirm had already been sent to them PRIOR to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of the trade.  I'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know I was working on this, but I told the Coral people I still needed the assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight.  Even tho I hate to have to do the additional work, with these EOL trades, there is no "oops" trade.  Once we enter into the trade with 1 entity of a counterparty, we cannot just "move" the trade.  We need the consent of the assignor and assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was not legally moved.   If eveyone on your team is not aware of this, can you mention it at your next group meeting...thanks! 
 I'm working on my backlog of lists.  I thought I'd send thru a few so you could get started. 
 HS Energy Services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the ESP criteria.  It does not meet the financial test on its own.  However, we have approved them to trade financial and have an ISDA Master in place.  Should I shut them down for the Australia products?    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/12/2000 06:25 PM 
 On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.  They are part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and obviously, a governmental, before the split up.  They are still a wholly owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to outside counsel about the governmental issues.  I have a call into Canadian counsel right now.  Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto... 
 In don't know anything about this, do you? 
 Attached is the proposed draft of the ISDA.  I think two substantive issues we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting "Affiliates" from the setoff section (which we agreed to in the original).  With all the bankruptcies going on right now Carol feels that we should at least make a stab at keeping Affiliates in.  Let me know if the draft is OK to send out. 
 Joe,  Attached is the termination revised w/Mary's changes.  Give me a call about one change.      Larry Joe Hunter 09/13/2000 04:52 PM 
 Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial power products online.  Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).  Call me if you have any questions about specific counterparties. 
 fyi, 
 Who is going to take over this master from Rod?  They send it in comments and are calling for a response. 
 You are the woman!    Tanya Rohauer 09/15/2000 10:15 AM 
 Per instructions from Davis Minns in Australia, I have to shut down HS Energy Services from trading Australian power (not that they are going to!).  I am attaching an amended spreadsheet. 
 Attached is a resend of the Deemed ISDA that Stepahnie sent to Diane Anderson 9n 8/13/00. 
 Just an FYI, did you notice that the NYMEX is applying to the CFTC to get a new electricity contract approved, the Mid-Columbia. 
 Are you or Sara going to work on this? 
 Clem called wanting to speak to someone about the guaranty issue.  Who should I direct him to? 
 Per our conversation, attached is the form of confirmation we use when we adopt by reference the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement into a form of confirmation. 
 Fred wanted to get this draft out today, so I had to get it back from Mary and get Robert Bruce to review it, then sent it out. 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing a redlined draft of the guaranty.   Please let me (713/853-3399) or Sara (713/853-5620) know if this change meets with your approval.  Further, I am in the process of drafting the Enron Corp. Guaranty with respect to ECT Investments, Inc. and hope to have it to you shortly. 
 Attached is termination revised with Mary's changes.  Per Mary's conv. w/Fred, if the Counterparty failed to make payments hereunder, the contract would not be void ab initio, but instead, any payments to the counterparty would be offset against any amounts owing to us.      Larry Joe Hunter 09/15/2000 11:31 AM 
 Mike,  Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting him security access.  Can we get him access? 
 I should be available anytime this week, with the caveat, we have a big deal we're trying to close by Friday, and it could heat up at any moment.  How about tomorrow at 1:00 pm?    Corey Hollander@ENRON 09/18/2000 03:48 PM 
 I have a meeting at 2:00pm.  How about 11:00 am?    Corey Hollander@ENRON 09/18/2000 04:50 PM 
 The revised form of ISDA exhibit.doc (which contains the credit support annex and letter of credit forms) has been moved into the attorney forms bank under atty.fms/current forms/isdaexh.doc.  The old form of ISDAexh.doc is now under "old forms" in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldISDAexh.doc. Again, per my last email, the revised Multicurrency Schedule is already in attorney forms.  You may want to circulate blacklined drafts.  The Index to the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your reference for the most current forms.  It is called "formlist.doc."  London and Singapore, FYI, in addition to making changes to the ISDA collateral annex, we made changes to the MAC definitions (which we inserted into ISDAexh.doc for ease of the paralegals) and made changes to the letter of credit terms, as well as the form of Letter of Credit.   We also added in an alternative "Credit Support Amount" provision on the front page of the ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement.  We moved the guaranty forms (Enron Corp. and Counterparty) as a separate document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc. The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed the procedures for timing of demands made on Enron (deleting the 15 day period).  We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the Enron Corp. guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.  We are close to finalizing changes to the Industrial Master, as well as making changes to the Omnibus form of confirmation. Also, by the end of the day I will have moved our standard forms of Secretary's Certificates into the attorney forms bank. 
 Does any of the below work for you? 
 Let's say 2:30 pm tomorrow and hope for the best!    Corey Hollander@ENRON 09/18/2000 05:04 PM 
 As we spoke I got scheduled for a 2:30 too, so how about 3:30 tomorrow?    Corey Hollander@ENRON 09/18/2000 05:04 PM 
 Mike,  How can these people access the database?    Michael Neves 09/18/2000 05:36 PM 
 I need the following 3 files 1st thing:  Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc. Ontario Power Generation Royal Bank of Canada/Enron Canada Corp.  Thanks! 
 Online would like to open this counterparty immediately for trading.  Can you let me know ASAP whether you have any legal issues with them.  Thanks. 
 Per our conv. earlier, attached is our standard form of Enron Corp. Guaranty. 
 Peter,  We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.  I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.  When you get a minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your approval.  Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised one (which is #1 documents below).  Can you print them out for Peter.  Thanks! 
 The above counterparty is approved to trade all products. 
 Attached are the two ISDA's. 
 We have been pressured by the online team to open up all counterparties to trade financial unless we have a LEGAL reason not to trade with them.  With both those counterparties, you are correct, it is the companies' intention and direction that we trade financial with those entities, but still for online I have to say "yes" unless I have a "legal" reason to say "no".    Kim S Theriot 09/19/2000 02:11 PM 
 All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather per our earlier emails).    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/19/2000 04:18 PM 
 I was just about to call you when I got your email.  Holly called and she has a table to fill at an awards banquet (some women's professional group or something) and wants to know if you want to join us.  A bunch of her girlfriends are going, me, Lucinda, I think Carol....anyway, it's Saturday night at 7:00 pm.  She said it should be really boring (so I put it on my calendar as "boring awards banquet"), but with all the girls at one table we'll misbehave and have fun.  I hope you can join us.  Let me know and I'll reserve you a spot w/Holly.  The thing on your house and townhome sounds exciting.  When can I see it?!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 09/18/2000 05:44 PM 
 I'm having a little online brain drain today...am I correct in my thinking that all these "spreads" are financial...? 
 Can you provide Stephanie Sever with the Online team view access to the referenced database.  Can you let us know when the access has been granted. Thanks! 
 This list is all amended counterparties, most of them being opened up for financial power.  My records reflect that all of them were already open for financial products, except the three I have marked.  If you run across any others that you show as not being open for financial, let me know, because all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial. 
 Also, on this list, my records reflect that Superior Natural Gas Corporation was shut down for physical power.  If you records do not reflect the same, can you shut them down...thanks! 
 I still haven't received that list you mentioned of counterparties in bankruptcy or workout.  What's the scoop? 
 I don't know about you, but I LOVE lists with only one counterparty to approve, how about you?!! 
 I have a database where I maintain my online approval, and my the basis for my approvals/declines.  If you want to review counterparties we have previously approved/disapproved and why, or want to go in and to see what I approved on a specific counterparty, this would be the place to go.  Would you like me to get you access? 
 Well, I do believe this makes 450!  A nice round number if I do say so myself! 
 At a ratio of 10:1, you should have your 4th one signed and have the fifth one on the way...    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 09/19/2000 05:40 PM 
 It seems like it should be more, but I have review over 1300 counterparties for online trading. 
 Straight and to the point!    Brent Hendry@ENRON 09/19/2000 06:00 PM 
 We have received a proposed assignment from PPL Corporation to PPL Energy Plus, LLC wherein they would like to assign their financial transactions (two), any guaranty relating thereto (do we have one covering financial?), and any master agreement (we have no financial agreement with them).  Is this OK with Credit?  I am having a copy of the assignment walked down to you.  If someone else is going to approve this, let me know. 
 I left Bill Ernstaft a message.  Hopefully I'll hear back from him after lunch.    Janelle Scheuer 09/20/2000 10:33 AM 
 I have it, it is in the Swaps library. 
 As usual, you are the best!    Greg Johnston 09/20/2000 03:09 PM 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of 9/1/00 wherein Coral Energy Resources, L.P. assigned to Coral Energy Holding, L.P. an "oops" EOL trade # 40063 it did under the wrong password.  A copy will be sent to Jeff Sorenson. 
 That job is with Bob Williams, the litigation attorney for our international company.  Bob is a great guy, probably one of the funniest people I have ever known.  It also might be a good job for you because he promoted his last administrative assistant to paralegal.    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 09/20/2000 11:51 AM 
 comments to the swap docuemnts 
 Paul,  I just spoke to Brent Hendry who worked on the Bermuda law advice, and he said he sent you the name of counsel.  I will also sent to you tonight a copy of the advice we just got with respect to derivative transactions and online transactions.    Paul Simons 09/21/2000 06:11 AM 
 Too late, already sent it.    Paul Simons 09/21/2000 10:21 AM 
 I would love to have the plants as long as they can take direct sun...can they?  Did you see on the news last night that they arrested 44 people for participating in that pyramid scheme you were telling me about?  There's an article about it in the KHOU TV website.     "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 09/21/2000 02:27 PM 
 Per your request, attached is the form of Duke Capital Corporation Guaranty. 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching our current from of ISDA Schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for such entities.  With respect to NYPA, we do have a copy of an authorization to hedge approved by the Board of Trustees of NYPA that they faxed us a year ago and I will fax a copy of it over to you shortly. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/23/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 FUNB sits stalled on my desk waiting for me to have time to work on it.  We are in the miiddle of a rush with Financial Power counterparties in need immediate assistance (many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention) and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and I'm just putting out fires.  That master is really not a priority at all for ENA, and it is only Enron.Credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority.  What is your proposed timing for a deal on that one?    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 09/22/2000 10:26 AM 
 It isn't clear to me whether you are on for this banquet tomorrow so I can RSVP to Holly!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 09/21/2000 03:34 PM 
 Per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at NYPA, they would like to transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we consider an "ISDA Confirmation" (it seemed to me their lawyer thought this document was a sufficient ISDA Master).  Sara has a call into him to get his thoughts about this document  Per my conversations w/Sara, we would like to get our standard governmental form of ISDA Master in place.  We wonder what your thoughts are on his document.  Further, he seemed quite firm that they would not be issuing a legal opinion, but would give us a certified copy of the resolution I am about to fax to you.   We look forward to getting your comments.    - CFD1.DOC 
 I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the game...GO TEAM!!! 
 FYI,  I will be preparing this assignment for signature. 
 On the list for 9/19/00: 1.  On the counterparty styled "United States Department of Interior" only, Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them read access. 2.  Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them for financial power  On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of Utilicorp.  However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I hope by my note only it will do the job.  I am also preparing an assignment of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed. 
 The execution documents were sent over to Duke Energy yesterday.  I spoke to them this morning and they we going to forward the documents internally for signature.  I, or Marie upon her return from vacation, will keep you posted on the progress of execution. 
 I have forwarded your email on to Mary Cook, she is actually the attorney working on the transaction.  I am a paralegal.  Her direct number is 713/3457732.    Cossette.Helene@hydro.qc.ca 09/22/2000 03:26 PM 
 You're welcome.    Camille Gerard@ENRON 09/22/2000 05:16 PM 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing clean and blacklined drafts of each of the Bow River Trust and Royal Bank of Canada ISDA Schedules. 
 Leslie Hansen asked me to forward to you our draft list of Legal contacts for online trading issues, and see if there is anyone you deal with on a regular basis that I may not know of that we need to add to the list. 
 I hope you're OK?!   You probably don't remember (especially after getting hit by that polo ball!), but Barclays is one you negotiated on your secondment here oh so many years ago.  It's always good to hear from you...    Justin Boyd 09/25/2000 11:11 AM 
 Obviously, you haven't lost your touch!    Justin Boyd 09/25/2000 11:35 AM 
 Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.  When we get this in signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment, but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention, we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this will cost us money too!  We don't want to have to do this too often.) Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?! 
 Ask and you shall receive... 
 Yes, except for weather, the financial GTC's are designed to cover all energy commodities.    Dianne Seib 09/25/2000 03:34 PM 
 Per a conv. I just had with John Arnold, Shankman is not trading natural gas at all.  His back trade is Mike Maggi. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 23, 2000 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed to Frank Davis and to Peter Keohane for the Enron Canada Talisman file. 
 Per our conversation, attached is the proposed form of amendment to the ISDA Master to provide for cash collateral under the Credit Support Annex.  Please call me at 713/853-3399 or Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Department at 713/853-3263 if you have any comments or questions. 
 Per our conversation, the above counterparty is approved by Legal to trade online physical pulp & paper only.  We cannot trade financial until Credit receives financial statements and can determine whether they are an eligible swap participant or not. 
 Chris,  Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion). As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let me know and I'll send you down the revisions.  By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not include the reps and warranties required to transact with such counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first. 
 The bottom of this email will explain my email to Gaffer. 
 Thanks Joe, you're the best!    Larry Joe Hunter 09/26/2000 03:34 PM 
 I'm sad (sniff...sniff...sniff...)... 
 Julian,  The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.  I don't know if what they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation filled in with the proposed deal terms.  I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.  As soon as I hear from her I'll get her what she needs.  If you have any more questions, email me back, or call.  I'm at your service! 
 Russell,  I spoke  to the cpy about this, and what it turned out he wanted was the Local Currency ISDA form.  I gave that redraft to Mary to sign off on the same day I wrote that note, but she's been too busy to look at it, and the file is now MIA from her office.  I'll check with her tomorrow and she what she did with it.    Russell Diamond 09/26/2000 05:53 PM 
 I would like to take the week of Thanksgiving off.  My mom is coming from NY to visit with my 10 year old niece. 
 It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.  Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online approvals.  The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade US bandwidth segments.  P.S. we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list. 
 Thanks, I appreciate it!  What should I do with the Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list?  Shut them down for all trading on Japan based products until I hear from you?  Will you be coming to the Legal Conference here in Houston next week?  Maybe we could chat then?!    Jane McBride@ENRON 09/27/2000 09:46 AM 
 FYI,  I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and reasons why (if there are any!).  I don't know to what extent Frank ever looked at it, but you might find it helpful.  It is called "ENA Legal Online Trading Agreements" database.  If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to get you access. 
 As a reminder,  We need to talk about some documentation Marcus Nettleton passed on to me for handling.  It's about the disclosure of the MG acquisition, some subordination loans & guarantees w/the NYMEX.  I asked Al Pennisi if it could wait until you got back and he said yes. 
 Mike,  Can you take care of this and let us know when Lisa has access.  Thanks. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 9/12/00 which amends the ETA to provide that Ameren Energy, Inc. can act as authorized agent for and on behalf of the following entities ("Operating Companies") under such ETA:  1.  Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE) 2.  Ameren Energy Generating Company 3.  Ameren Energy Marketing Company  The amendment to the ETA makes additional changes with respect to the agency relationship between Ameren Energy, Inc. and the Operating Companies.  In connection with such amendment to the ETA we have also received:  1.  The originally executed Password Application 2.  Consent and Acknowledgement executed by the Operating Companies with respect to such agency relationship  Copies will be distributed. 
 Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe (www.bishopslodge.com).   Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great. The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the activities going on in Santa Fe.  I think you are going to be too late for their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other fun things going on.  The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking pool, horseback riding and shooting.  Take a look. 
 As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap agreements.  I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept. copies of the current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him revisions to the forms.  I'll keep you posted when the changes occur. 
 Is anyone working on a confirmation for the Argentina office for a swap between ECT and Duke Energy International out of Argentina, Don Black would be the business person on this.  If you know, I need to get the draft faxed ASAP to Duke here in Houston. 
 Yes.    Michael Neves 09/27/2000 01:22 PM 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing drafts of the following documents:  1.  Clean and blacklined copies of the ISDA Schedule showing revisions from the 9/22/00 draft.  Please note that RBC needs to complete the notice information. 2.  Copies of the Interest Rate and Commodity Confirmations.  Please note that certain dates, rates and pricing need to be determined early tomorrow.  Please call me or Sara with any questions or comments with respect to the enclosed.

 Attached please the proposed forms of Confirmation with respect to the referenced transaction.  Please call me or Sara Shackleton if you have any comments or questions. 
 I have some appointments outside the office this afternoon and will need to leave early today. 
 I don't know why I am on these emails?    Wilma Low 09/28/2000 04:26 AM 
 Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.    Greg Johnston 09/28/2000 09:29 AM 
 Can you change Peter's name, I had it wrong, it's "Peter C.M. Keohane". Thanks!    carrd2@tdcibg.com 09/28/2000 09:21 AM 
 Please find attached a clean and blacklined draft of the revised ISDA Master. 
 So far as much as I've been able to track, the Houston Confirmation Desk does not know about this Duke Confirm yet.  Don, can you contact Dale Neuner on the Confirmation Desk ASAP with the proposed deal terms so he can prepare the Confirm and get it sent over to Duke.  Thanks! 
 Per,  What's the deal he's talking about?  I also do not think we could put ENA and Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.  When you have a mingute give me a ring.  Tana 
 Please call Morris Clark or Steve Douglas. 
 Jeff hasn't left the group, has he?    Larry Joe Hunter 09/29/2000 08:47 AM 
 Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the Schedule reflecting your insert.  I think it is our intention to just insert the revised page into the agreement.      "Ross, Tracy " <TRACY.ROSS@ROYALBANK.COM> 09/29/2000 08:12 AM 
 Here is the interest rate we are going to mirror to create for Toronto Dominion. 
 NYPA called today wanting to know the status of our review.  Can we pow wow about this 1st thing Monday... 
 Mike, have you been able to figure out how to get Brent Hendry, who is now in Buenos Aires, access to our Master Swap Agreement database?  Can you let me know.  I'm getting bugged about this. 
 I do not know the answer to your question.  I suggest you talk to Credit. Financial does indeed have a master with Weyerhaueser Company Limited.  I have no idea what we trade physical under or what other Weyerhaueser companies we may have business with.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 09/29/2000 06:37 PM 
 I am just confirming with each of you that I will be opening up The Toa Reinsurance Company Limited, a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list to trade all physical and financial products, including Australian and Japanese weather, which seems to be the products they are truly interested in trading.  Let me know if you have any problems with that immediately. 
 I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.  On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I already had them open for emissions.  Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for physical gas. 
 I confirmed w/Brad that they are still an ESP, so it's OK to open them up for all financial.    Lisa Lees 10/02/2000 03:42 PM 
 What's the scoop on this? 
 Will do, I'll send you a copy too.  I'm just waiting to get Sara's direction on one comment to the Legal Opinion, then I'll be ready to send it out.    Janelle Scheuer 10/03/2000 09:57 AM 
 As you all are probably aware, we trade physical and financial products with Northern Illinois Gas Company under each of the following names:  1  Northern Illinois Gas Company (the legal incorporated entity) 2.  Nicor Gas Company (an assumed name for Northern Illinois Gas Company as reflected in the Assumed Name Certificate dated 12/15/99 filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois.  The name needs to match the Assumed Name Certificate, no "Co.") 3.  Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company  The EnronOnline counterparty has been set up as "Nicor Gas Company".  Pursuant to Bob Bruce's conversation with our Illinois outside counsel, we are comfortable transacting business in the State of Illinois under the assumed name "Nicor Gas Company".  In connection therewith, it is OK to set up the online entity as "Nicor Gas Company", and attach the relevant physical or financial products to the relevant master under each of the above counterparty names.  Further, it will be OK if the confirmations go out as "Nicor Gas Company" even though the masters may be under one of the above names.  PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, this should be considered an exception to the rule.  We do not want counterparties to be set up under assumed names, d/b/a's or divisions for EnronOnline.  As previously agreed with the Online team, every attempt should be made to incorporate the legal name as part of the counterparty name (such as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" or "Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division").   Any exceptions to this should be run by Legal for approval. 
 Did you make a note under H.Q. Energy Services in Lotus Notes...?    Mary Cook 10/03/2000 01:58 PM 
 No can do...just made appt. to go to lunch with CSS.  However, he cancels on me half the time, so if he cancels again I'd love to go...    Mary Cook 10/03/2000 03:08 PM 
 August 30 is fine for lunch. 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, I am attaching a copy of our proposed form of Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and proposed form of counterparty legal opinion.  If you have any questions, please call Sara at (713) 853-5620 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to getting your comments. 
 We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 ("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and option transactions"  with ENA.  For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.  I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts and Camille Gerard. 
 Pretty funny!  I went over to harass him, but he must be on vacation!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/03/2000 03:32 PM 
 fyi, 
 The Mounties have arrived!    Stacey Richardson 10/04/2000 03:57 PM 
 When you have a minute can we talk about this...thanks! 
 Attached is revised list opening Edison Mission Marketing & Trade for emissions. 
 Tobin,  You don't need to keep Taffy on the list about our volume positions.  She is mine and Mark's assistant and just prints out the forms for us.  She really doesn't need to know the specific position limits in the form. 
 For Xeron, Inc.-amended no change means, they were initially open for financial, shut down for power, open for all other physical products.  No change from that approval. 
 My assistant, Taffy Milligan will be sending it to you.    Martin Rosell 10/05/2000 08:16 AM 
 There seems to be some question whether Utilicorp. can trade financial.  I opened them to trade all financial (including power) on 7/26/00.  I think the customer is calling Kathy for access.  There should be no change in their physical power profile. 
 can you fax her the fron of the ISDA Schedule for Utilicorp.  She must be in the Oslo office. 
 Looks good!  Thanks! 
 Matt,  Can you provide me with the name and address of who we should send this amendment to for signature?  I still have to run it by an attorney, though.    Matthew Dawson 10/05/2000 10:34 AM 
 Attached is the referenced list.  I am saying "amended-no change" because for Calpine, I originally had them open for power & financial, and I am not changing that approval, and for Nicor, I originally had them open for financial and shut down for power and I am not changing that approval. 
 I'm preparing for a presentation I have to give tomorrow.  Once I'm done with this I'll give you a call...    Susan D Trevino 10/09/2000 03:46 PM 
 Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.    John Malowney 10/09/2000 04:18 PM 
 See email below to John. 
 Sounds good to me!    Lisa Lees 10/09/2000 05:39 PM 
 Take today off (from EOL at least!). 
 We just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from Deutsche Bank, and I hope to respond back to you shortly, once I have had a chance to confirm they made all the changes.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 10/10/2000 04:33 AM 
 Brent,  I am having this woman with Duke here in Houston, Roni Cappadonna, calling me wanting to get the form of the confirmation.  I don't know what to tell her. Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to wait until the trade is done?  I think the person that really needs to be handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.  I am kinda just in the middle of the confirm thing.  Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing with Roni. 
 The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm. 
 It was cute!    Genia FitzGerald 10/10/2000 03:23 PM 
 Can you forward alison the template for an omnibus swap.  The attached appears to be an EOL template. 
 Can you pass this on to the next person...thanks! 
 It's really all Genia's fault, she goes to lunch too darn early.  I guess we need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/10/2000 04:04 PM 
 On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it up to me. 
 It's no surprise to me to find Reggie's been stirring it up!    Genia FitzGerald 10/11/2000 07:43 AM 
 We have been doing this here in Houston via a Unanimous Consent of the Directors of the Company appointing the individual(s) as agents and attorneys-in-fact.  Do you sugguest I proceed this way or via the Power of Attorney below? 
 Per Steven Vu's message, I still haven't received the info we need to complete the online weather GTC's.  Any word on when we can expect it? 
 FYI-waiting for direction. 
 That change will have to be approved by Mark Taylor, who is out of town until next week. 
 These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of today.    Cindy Buckley 10/11/2000 09:22 AM 
 John Arnold wants this counterparty opened ASAP for financial.  We didn't have any financial statements from them when they originally came thru, so we couldn't determine their ESP status, but we're OK now, so if you could open them for financial ASAP.  Thanks. 
 I just got off the phone w/Derek.  I'll make sure someone handles it.    Shari Stack 10/11/2000 01:55 PM 
 Karen,  Upon re-review w/Credit, we have decided not to open this counterparty up for financial trading until further legal and credit issues are resolved.    Karen Lambert 10/11/2000 12:06 PM

 Dear Greg,  As we discussed, I am attaching our proposed form of ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex for your review.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 713/853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.  cc:   Tom May Ed Sacks, Credit Bob Bruce, Senior Counsel 
 Have you done deals in the UK and France that we should use as our model? 
 MALCOLM Greg -CONTROLLER <greg.malcolm@ontariopowergeneration.com> 10/12/2000 08:19 AM  Let me know if you still don't get the attachment. 
 We will try to get back to them soon.  We had to locate Indiana counsel to advise us on this, and hope to engage them today.    Kim S Theriot 10/12/2000 09:34 AM 
 Please remember that all online confidentiality agreement should be logged in through me, I prepare a list of them for the Online Team.  All regular conffidentiality agreements should be logged in through one of the paralegals so we can monitor them.  Also, we need to do a conflicts check with Kay. Thanks. 
 Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau sent up for our review.  We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading websites, and (2) respond to Craig about this agreement.  When you both get back in town can we set a time to discuss this.  Thanks... 
 This seems like something the Confirmation Desk should do, or you.  I have never dealt with the deal tickets before. 
 I don't see any problem with this request, do you? 
 Per our conversation while you were here, attached is a list of all the Japanese counterparties that have requested Password Applications from EnronOnline.  Let me know you thoughts about this, and, as we discussed, online due diligence with respect to Japanese counterparties. 
 Justy,  I don't think there is any problem with this.  But since Harry told me to run it by you, I am.  Could you sign off ASAP.  Thanks! 
 Any problem? 
 Mark Taylor is going the be the host of the next ECT Legal Conference to be held in the Woodlands in October and he asked me to contact you to see if you know yet which of the Brits are going to be attending because we need to start making reservations.  If you get a minute and can drop me a line I'd appreciate it.  Thanks! 
 For the online trading project, I am trying to track down for the U.K., the Datasource, Reporting Service, and Reporting Agency for the GTC.  I understand that you might either have that information or be able to direct me to someone who does.  I appreciate whatever help you can give me! 
 Can y'all help me get the document below signed by an officer of ECC and return the originally signed document to me.  I will send them all out together back to the counterparty.  FYI-Andy Zipper is second in command to Louise Kitchen for EnronOnline.  Thanks for your help!

 Per Leslie's earlier email, she wants power trading for Tri-State only under one entity, so I have shut down Tri-State Power Marketing (the division), and have opened them up under Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., which, per my conv. w/Stephanie, is being amended to add "through its Tri-State Power Marketing Division" to the PA. 
 Per a head's up from Tanya, LG&E Power Marketing was merged into LG&E Energy Marketing and is no longer an active corporation.  Take it off the executed master list. 
 I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next week to discuss this. 
 In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we need to make to the list. 
 I do not believe that statement is correct.  The limitation was required in the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all agreements.  Can you send me up a copy of the Password Application and I will give Steve Norris a call.  Thanks.    Camille Gerard@ENRON 10/14/2000 12:44 PM

 Per our conversation, I am attaching a sample form of online weather GTC.  As we discussed, I am trying to complete the information for "Datasource" and under "Floating Amount" for Reporting Service and Reporting Agency for the U.K.  Thanks for your help! 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.  This guaranty will supersede and replace, in part, the prior guaranty with respect to ENA and Counterparty.  The guaranty will be fully replaced when counterparty receives the new Enron Corp. Guaranty with respect to the obligations of Enron Canada and Engage Canada (still covered under the existing guaranty, and such replacement is still under negotiation).  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 Attached is documentation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State reflecting the name change of Engage Energy US, L.P. to Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., such name change to be effective on October 3, 2000 (per the corrective amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State attached hereto.  Please make a note of this name change in your records.

 I have received a Notice of Assignment that effective 8/21/00, Public Service Electric and Gas Company has transferred to PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC its interest in the ETA with ENA dated 01/11/00.

 Per our conversation, attached is the form of ISDA Agreement, with Enron guaranty attached to it.  As we discussed, Cadwalader will issue an enforceability opinion with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty, so we need to provide them with an opinion with respect to Enron Corp. general corporate matters.  Thanks for your help!

 I'm still looking for that list of approved European countries for online trading.  Any word...? 
 I received a faxed copy of the Customer Registration Form, Password Application and Letter Agreement amending the ETA.  I expect the originals to follow tomorrow.  I will have copies walked down to Lisa since the customer is eager to start trading.  I will follow with the originals in the usual course of business. 
 No, no ISDA's or other master agreements in place with this counterparty.    Justin Boyd 10/17/2000 05:04 AM 
 I  think maybe if we could get together with Frank and call Jeff then we could resolve this w/o continuing circular conversations.  Jeff is familiar with the issue now.    Mark Taylor 10/17/2000 09:25 AM 
 Below is an icon that will get you view access to the financial agreement database.

 Thanks!  I'll get Lavo's title changed.  I spoke to our buddy in London this morning.  He seems to be doing wonderful, as usual.  He and Sue are getting ready to buy a new house in Twickenham, four bedrooms, garage (so he can park his new convertible home instead of across town) on the river.  It sounds really nice.  He has been traveling alot.  Weddings almost every weekend for months.  Rowing.  That about sums it up.  I ran into Gaffer for the 1st time in months.  By his traveling schedule, I think we've really hired him to be a door to door salesman.  I heard the Mounties have arrived for you.  Your new lawyer has started. Congrats! 
 I checked w/the Corp. Secretary's office, and they were unaware that Rex and Dave  were appointed as MD's, so the corporate paralegal is getting the board resolution passed adding them on, as well as adding Mark Palmer as a VP.    Louise Kitchen 10/18/2000 10:34 AM 
 Neither Enron London nor Enron London/Singapore has an ISDA Master in place with Union Oil Company of California.  ENA does, but that won't help you.       Rikesh Patel 10/18/2000 09:27 AM 
 Mark,  Mieco is the cpy where we had the misposted/bad online trade & we held up their master.  Can we send it out?    Edward Sacks@ENRON 10/18/2000 12:41 PM 
 Remember as those Ameren Energy Inc., as agent, etc. for various companies we got ETA amendments in for.  They are coming thru tonight as as online counterparty but want to start trading today.  Any problems? 
 Are you working on an ETA amendment for them? 
 Justin  I've been running around trying to determine whether we have a tax problems with Amita doing what she's doing for the above companies, and I'm hearing that you've already cleared that with tax.  Can you please confirm this for me.    Justin Boyd 10/11/2000 09:49 AM 
 First, this counterparty is OK to trade physical power.  I just spoke to Leslie, and she said it was OK to set up "Ameren Energy, Inc. as  Agent " under one cpy id # for the three utilities and that's how they would trade. We spoke to Melissa Murphy on the Power Confirm Desk and she is going to set up a special confirmation template that will add the three utilities names to the confirmations before they go out.  I think this is how Global Counterparty already set them up.  If this doesn't compute, let me know...  The Confirmations would then go out as Ameren Energy, Inc., as Authorized Agent for and on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing Company, Ameren Energy Gathering Company, and Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE). 
 Are you holding up this cpy for any reason? 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 10/18/00.  I will deliver a copy to Dovie Keprta, until I receive any further direction as to who you would like to be the central file keeper for eMarket Services documents. 
 Very good! 
 Thanks for the note.  Just pass on my concern for Clarissa and hope for her improvement.    Fiona Stewart 10/19/2000 06:44 AM

 Just a note to remind you to add the "ESP' and "Country" information to clickpaper spreadsheets too so I can get those out while you're gone. 
 At the request of David Minns their short name in Lotus Notes will be EAF (for Enron Australia Finance).   David gave me a list of their masters, so I am going to enter just the names and agreement.  David and Alison will flesh out the rest of the data when he gets back. 
 Leslie Hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.  I told her we were meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can control and prevent "rogue" trading.  She said before she sent this out she would contact you. 
 The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered them into the database.  We still don't have copies.  Further, I don't know more than if it's executed and the date.   They need to flesh out the additional information that is required. 
 ANP Marketing Company has faxed in their PA and ETA amendment and we should get the originals in by fedex today.  They are hot to trade ERCOT online, and I don't know if they can trade it or not, but if we could move them up to the top of the credit review list they would be most happy. 
 The critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued. Thanks for your help.    Juana.Fayett@enron.com 10/19/2000 10:32 AM 
 Mark Taylor asked me to run something on Online Trading by you.  We got a list of questions on various Online Trading issues from the Products Control Group which appears to be the group the will be managing the Online Trading HelpDesk.  One of their questions related to the desire of HelpDesk managers to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what they explained as a "quality control" over the responses given to customers on the HelpDesk.  They explained it as being like when your credit card company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to time.  Is this something we want to do?  If we do, that brings up other issues, and we will have to run this by our outside counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell.  Can you let me know your thoughts...Thanks! 
 Thanks for the heads up!  As usual, you're the best!    Bob Bowen 10/19/2000 10:39 AM 
 Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the changes to the ISDA Schedule.  We have also attached the proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and the legal opinions of Enron North America and Enron Corp.  The opinions of Cadwalader with respect to the ISDA and the Guaranty will be sent shortly under separate cover from Susan Lobel at Cadwalader.  It appears the only remaining issue on the ISDA is the "Conditions Precedent" provision which NYPA is still considering.  Please let me know if these changes meet with your approval. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of= =20 the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under= =20 an  ISDA Master Agreement.  This Counterparty is an affiliate of the utilit= y=20 for the Province of Quebec, Hydro-Quebec.  We will need the standard execut= ed=20 copy.

In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  (i) Certificat= e=20 of Incumbency, (ii) certified board resolutions of the Policy for Approval = of=20 Guarantees (=01&Policy=018), (iii) certificate by the Treasurer or other au= thorized=20 officer certifying coverage of the Guaranty under the Policy, and (iv)=20 certified copy of Enron Corp.=01,s articles of incorporation and bylaws.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the=20 documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 I bet you thought I forgot about you?!  The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being done.  If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 10/10/2000 12:57 PM 
 We have received the executed Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information with the referenced Counterparty dated effective 10/1/00.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Harry,  I believe this is yours... 
 We have received the originally executed Letter Agreement amending the referenced Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.  We also received the originally executed Password Application and Customer Registration Form.  I will send those down to EOL and no copies will be kept in Legal. 
 Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France where we used their Toulouse address.  I just wanted to confirm that the address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of Paris, not Toulouse.  If you'll just confirm that for me. 
 Thanks for your help here.  Can you do me one more favor?  Can you check and make sure I am the only person that has access to change keywords.  Thanks!    Michael Neves 10/20/2000 10:23 AM 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  You should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access only.  They should not see our comments.  That information is confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege).   Let me know if you do not have edit access.  Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside your area of responsibility.  A few notes...  There is some great reporting functionality in this database.  Check out some of the sorts on the left.  There is a drop down called "Pending Swap Update".  That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial agreements.  There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate reports for you compan  The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.  Kinda, before you do/authorize a trade read this.  Not for general legal notes.  Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded elsewise (it will mess up reporting).  If you are amending an agreement or superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".  I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs. If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.  Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.   Link -->

 I was just sitting here thinking, now that y'all are doing the financial confirms up there, your Confirmation Desk people need to be on the distribution list for our emails when we get signed masters in, so they know when they need to change from a non-master style of confirm, to a master style of confirm.  Who, pray tell, might your Confirmation Desk people be so we can add them... 
 We have received an executed Assignment and Novation Agreement dated 8/16/00 where EOL commodity swap Deal No. 267025, transacted 6/23/00 originally between Amoco Canada ("Amoco Canada") Petroleum Company and Enron Canada Corp.   The trade has been assigned as follows:  Amoco Canada assigned its interest in the trade to BP Amoco Corporation  ECC assigned its interest in the trade to ENA.  Copies will be distributed.

 There are a number of Argentina counterparties on this list that I will need your sign off on.  Brent said he things they will probably be OK to trade Argentina Gas, but to run it by you.  Can you let me know if you have any issues.  I am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too. Initially, we should have a rush of Argentina counterparties, but after awhile, it should dwindle.  The rule is, you have ONE DAY to respond  or I will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list. 
 In response to our comments from yesterday's form meeting, I am saving the Industrial in my forms directory, now as #5 draft.  If you have to draft one let me know, and we'll figure out which form to work off of. 
 We do not have an ISDA master in place with this cpy, however,  Susan Bailey and Sara Shackleton did send them a draft in August.  I would think unless ECTRIC is going to be a direct cpy to a master, Craig Young should contact Susan and Sara directly...?    Justin Boyd 10/23/2000 10:21 AM 
 Can you sent out that original Participation Agreement for signature to the cpy.  I am attaching my form of letter so you can copy it.  Thanks. 
 Can you please send this cpy a copy of their ISDA Master.  The contact is Kimberly Gentle at (509) 495-4055, fax (509) 495-8176.  Thanks. 
 Since this is a financial product I don't need approvals back from any of you.  I really just wanted to alert you to this new product, especially the physical steel team. 
 I just got a call from the online team, and there is a rush push on from London to get this counterparty approved ASAP.  Since you are the key person, I thought I'd pull you into the loop.  This counterparty should be coming thru on tomorrow's approval list.  I know you've got to do your due diligence, so if you could let me know how long it will take to get back to me I can let the EOL and London people know.  Much thanks!  P.S.  I enjoyed chatting with you at the seminar! 
 Per Jane's email, I think we can definitely approve them to trade Japanese products.  I want to confirm with her the approval for the rest of the products, tho I think they'll probably be OK too.  So today, you could open them for Japan. 
 I have told EOL this counterparty is approved to trade Japanese products.  I just want to confirm with you, are they also approved to trade all the other products, physical and financial around the world?    Jane McBride@ENRON 10/23/2000 07:20 PM

 Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   December 10, 1996  Executed Date:   October 20, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron Canada Corp.  Counterparty:   Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Weather Foreign Exchange  Confirming Entity:  ECC  PLEASE NOTE:  Party A and Party B are co-Calculation Agents under this Agreement 
 I'm going to call you Quick Draw McGraw!    Leslie Hansen 10/24/2000 02:56 PM 
 With respect to the "amends":  Calpine Power:  was already open for financial-no change to that approval  Utilicorp.:  I originally had Enron sales only for power, but Leslie is now telling me to open them for all power.  Constellation:  I originally had them shut down for financial, so I am opening them up.  I originally had them shut down for power and they should stay shut down. 
 At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Dovie at (713) 345-8664 with any questions or comments you might have.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have the agreement executed by an authorized officer of webMethods and return the copy to me for execution by Enron. 
 Per our meeting, attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's incorporating the tax language and completing the  Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Data Source information. 
 Below is a revised presentation from the EOL team that should have the most updated slides for MEH's online presentation that you are working on. 
 Is OK w/you to copy the profile below, for the new gas product at the end of this email? 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 10/24/2000 05:01 PM 
 What's the scoop on this? 
 Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or Mark Frevert to sign. 
 You're the best!    Michael Slade 10/25/2000 11:27 AM 
 Again, can you please take me off whatever distribution list I am on.  Thanks.    Paul de Canha 10/25/2000 12:10 PM 
 FYI, for your Gibraltar deal.  I am going to save this in attorney.fms, current forms. 
 I sent it to the crude oil option trader.  Is that good enough?    Mark Taylor 10/25/2000 11:42 AM 
 I'm not sending this out.  I'm trying to get off this list too.    Dan Masters 10/25/2000 01:06 PM 
 This is not my distribution.  I am trying to get off of it too!    Stacey Richardson 10/25/2000 01:35 PM 
 Travis needs to get copies of the ETA's below.  I don't know if there is someone here in Houston that can get them for him, or someone in London.  I usually would have called Edmund on this but he's out sick for awhile.  Can you track it down for us?  Thanks! 
 Euromoney stopped doing their great seminar a few years back.  We have not yet found any other seminar that equals it.  I'll keep my eyes posted, though.    Alan Aronowitz 10/25/2000 04:16 PM 
 You bet.  I faxed a copy out to them earlier this afternoon.  We also faxed a copy to London, and hope to get it back signed by EnronCredit.com first thing tomorrow morning.    Peter Feltman@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/25/2000 04:15 PM 
 My materials are 6 years old.  Do you think they would be of any benefit?    Alan Aronowitz 10/25/2000 05:26 PM 
 Thanks for your help!  Are you getting back from vacation?  How's your house coming?  I know you are really busy, but if you get a free minute I'd love to hear the scoop... 
 Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.  I need to give EOL responses by Friday for all these counterparties.  In addition, we should have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we have to approve by Friday.  I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.  Thanks! 
 Nov. 4    Genia FitzGerald 10/26/2000 07:54 AM 
 Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you need to talk to Erica... 
 Michael Slade forwarded me your advice  with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement with i2 Technologies.  We appreciate your help on this.  Per my conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and pursuing US based customers.  We wanted to confirm with you that on a going forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.  Thanks for your help with this. 
 We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among Pure Markets Corporation and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 10/25/00.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group. She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.  To draft an NDA I will need the following information:  1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor. 2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer? 3.  The counterparty's full legal name. 4.  Counterparty's address. 5.  Contact name at the counterparty. 6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to send it yourself, I will forward it to you. 7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.  I look forward to working with you! 
 OK, you caught me!!!    Leslie Hansen 10/26/2000 10:07 AM 
 Please put on calendar.  Thanks. 
 Nikki,  How do we dial that number from the US?  Is there a particular country code we have to use?  Thanks for your help! 
 FYI 
 Thanks Lisa!    Lisa Lees 10/26/2000 10:43 AM 
 Attached is our proposed form of NDA.  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of further service. 
 Attached is the one way (counterparty) only form you requuested.      Bruce Harris@ENRON 10/26/2000 12:29 PM 
 Just a note re: "Miller Balish O'Neil PC" on the list from the 25th.  I just had a conversation with Mark about that one, it sounds awfully like a law firm to us.  Unless a member of the Legal Dept. requests a guest ID for a law firm doing legal research for us, we should never grant guest ID's to a law firm.  It can only hurt us!  It's possible it could be an accounting firm. Per Mark, we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either.  "PC" (for professional corporation) is a good giveaway that we might have one or the other. 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated 10/26/00.  Copies will be distributed. 
 I really appreciate your help! 
 Credit called and asked if we could get them a rush approval on the referenced counterparty.  Let me know if you have anyproblems.  Thanks! 
 Can you add the physical products to the Legal tab so I don't have to copy them every day.  Thanks!    Walter Guidroz@ENRON 10/26/2000 12:00 PM 
 Re: Rush on Oklahoma.  They are OK for all products. 
 Above counterparty needs to be opened immediately to trade, specifically coal.  Let me know if you have any problems ASAP. 
 PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure that they can trade it under the GISB.  They want to amend the ETA to that effect.  I'm not sure how we want to handle this.  Get Stacy/Jeff's approval that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?  The woman who called is Denise Pocius at (973) 430-8181. 
 We have received the Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement between Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P. and ENA dated 10/5/00.  This amendment makes certain credit changes to the agreement, including, but not limited to, changing Counterparty's Guarantor from UEI Holdings Inc., formerly know as Union Energy Inc. ("UEI") to The Coastal Corporation ("Coastal").    Copies of this Amendment and the new guarantees issued in connection therewith will be distributed. 
 Queshare,  As you requested... 
 Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the final revisions.  Let me know if they meet with your approval and I will start processing them for signature. 
 Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Unfortunately, the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.       Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 10/20/2000 12:22 PM 
 Jennifer McQuade called again to see if we had contacted Elzear Lemieux at counterparty re: comments to an NDA.  If you haven't, his direct no. is 903/237-5408. 
 ? 
 David,  The link is at the bottom of this email. 
 When you have a minute to review this, can we meet so you can handle this response to Anthony.  Thanks. 
 When you get back into the office, can we visit about updating the ENA resolutions re: confirmation signatories.  I think we need to clean out some of the data in the Corporate Database re:  confirmation signatories.  Thanks! 
 Fred,  Per our conversation, this link will get you access into the Master Swap Agreement database, where you can look up the status of any master agreement.  If you have some time, why don't you take a look at it and see if your group would find this helpful. 
 Cute!    Kaye Ellis 10/30/2000 04:53 PM 
 Who is Molly Matheso? 
 A few news flashes re: limitations on products:  1.  The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina counterparties.  They have licensing requirements similar to US physical power.  All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut down for this product. 2.  Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties. 
 David,  This ETA is for ClickPaper. 
 Am trying to get copies of the executed NDA's for the counterparties listed below.  When you get this can you call me.... 
 At Brent's request, I am sending you the memo below. 
 When we can get a copy of this, we need to make sure it's broad enough to cover what you're doing... 
 Christian Yoder is looking for the course material for some of the in-house derivatives seminars.  Does anyone have some material we can lend him? 
 I extend my begrudging congratulations....    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/31/2000 03:39 PM 
 FYI 
 Looks OK for me.    Lisa Lees 10/31/2000 04:25 PM 
 Justy,  We are going to be trading with Deutsche Bank out of their New York and London branch offices online.  Per my conv. w/the online team, we going to have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we haven't solved multibranch customers online).  With Edmund out, I need someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA Master with.  Can you have someone there send me the docs.  Much thanks... 
 We have received the originally executed Participant Agreements dated 10/13/00 between each of Enron North America Corp., Enron Canada Corp., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and the IntercontinentalExchange, LLC.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Thanks, I appreciate it!    Nicola Beales 11/01/2000 04:08 AM 
 Just a note on Kaiser, the agreement we have in place has terrible credit, and Bill Bradford w/Credit refuses to trade under it.  We are in the process of replacing it with another.    Craig Young 11/01/2000 07:14 AM 
 What is the full name of Wabash?  I'm working on a master now w/Wabash Valley Power Ass'n.    Craig Young 11/01/2000 07:14 AM 
 FYI  (p.s.  I told him Bill hates Kaiser and we can't trade under it) 
 Nony has the Mexico file.  If it's anywhere it should be there.    Brent Hendry@ENRON 10/31/2000 11:04 AM 
 FYI 
 OK.    Lola Willis@ENRON 10/31/2000 01:32 PM 
 I spoke to Ed Sacks in Credit re: AEP.  We have an ISDA in place with AEP Energy Services, Inc.  When they trade under that master they are trading for their own account.  When they trade as American Electric Power Service Corporation they are actually trading as the service company for the family of utilities under their umbrella.  So it's 2 different counterparties. 
 We had the attached agreement executed by each of Enron North America, Enron Canada and Enron Power Marketing. 
 Justy,  Re: the below, we shouldn't be signing passwords any more for ENA, so I wanted to confirm with you that I should only be preparing this resolution for EOL...?    Justin Boyd 10/11/2000 09:49 AM 
 Contacts:  Massachusetts Electric Co. - Michael Hager, 508/421-7350 Navajo Tribal Utility Authority-Diana Dechilly, 520/729-6238     Leslie Hansen 11/01/2000 04:15 PM 
 The only online trading counterparty lists I am aware you see are the lists that originate from Houston Credit.  London has their own lists of counterparties I never see.  Do you think we need to get them to forward all lists with Japanese & Australian counterparties to you and Jane for approval? 
 I haven't seen or heard anything on this... 
 Per our conversation, attached is your bid form. 
 FYI, I just sent this to the paralegals, but then I though y'all would like to know who Molly is too. 
 The above counterparty is a really old one that appears to have come online before we opened up financial power for trading.  It appears they never got opened up when it came online.  Can we add them to tomorrow's list to open them for financial power.  Much thanks! 
 My last notes on Denmark from Edmund were due diligence pending.  What's the scoop on commodity derivatives, weather derivatives, credit derivatives, derivatives in general.  Any restrictions on any other products?  Thanks for your voicemail re:  Enron Metals.  I'll give you a call in the morning when I get in.  I miss my Justy... 
 For Massachusetts Electric Company and Navajo Tribal Utility Authority: you'll notice they want to trade power and we're shutting them down.  Leslie has to call the counterparties and talk to them about their power status. They're not showing up on the FERC approved lists, so Leslie has to figure out how/if they can trade power. 
 Yes!    Michael Slade 11/02/2000 04:14 AM 
 Thanks!    Michael Slade 11/02/2000 08:29 AM 
 How clever of you to notice that this was for paralegals.  I didn't.  No, we never have any coordinated gatherings.  This may be a first!  How are you?   Did you have a good time on your Miami vacation?    Andrea Calo@ENRON 11/02/2000 01:25 PM 
 I have a bunch of NDA's coming thru, so I thought I'd send you an email:  1.  Leslie drafted an NDA yesteeday with Proxicom, Inc.  - I don't know if she ran it by you... 2.  Ariba, Inc. 3.  Commerce One, Inc. 4.  Exodus Communications, Inc. 5.  Financial Settlement Matrix 6.  Interliant, Inc. 7.  Inwarehouse.com 8.  Oracle Corporation 11.  Sabre Corporation 
 Did you ever speak to Gillian Johnson yesterday about the difference of these 2 agmts? 
 I have made Sunday brunch reservations for September 12th at Brennan's for noon.  Be there or be square... 
 We have received the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement effective as of 11/1/00 by and among the referenced Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 09/04/00 amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Do you not want to hear about any NDA's?    Kara Knop@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/02/2000 03:13 PM 
 Thanks Kay!    Kay Young 11/02/2000 03:16 PM 
 Primagaz Trading Paris is a French counterparty that had come thru London. Credit doesn't want them to trade US products.  I've never looked at it before, so I had to treat it as a new cpy. 
 Can you please contact Stephanie Panus with these request.  I forwarded your other one on to her and she is handling.    Anthony Campos 11/03/2000 07:54 AM 
 Yes, the attached is what we signed.    Amita Gosalia 11/03/2000 04:09 AM 
 The resolution giving Robert Cass and Sheri Thomas approval to execute Password Applications as agents and attorneys-in-fact has been executed effective 11/02/00.  I will send a copy down to Frank Davis.  The original goes into the Company's Minute Books maintained in the Corporate Secretary's Office on the 48th Floor. 
 We have received the following executed documents from counterparty:  1.  First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 04/27/99 between ECT and Engage Energy US, L.P. (i) making certain changes to setoff provisions and (ii) changing Counterparty's exposure threshold; and  2.  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) between ECT Canada and Engage Energy Canada, L.P. executed 05/03/99, effective as of 01/31/97.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the fully executed Information Services Agreement between Enron Net Works LLC and Kase and Company, Inc. dated 11/1/00.  Copies will be distributed.

 Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   September 1, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:   H.Q. Energy Services (U.S.) Inc.  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Foreign Exchange  Confirming Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Governing Law:   New York  Special Provisions:  The Confirmation section prescribes using the form of confirmation contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions or the 1993 ISDA Commodity Definitions.  The timing for dispute of confirmations has been amended from the standard 2 days to 3 days.  Confirmation Desk:  note p.28 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement prescribes the rounding conventions. 
 This master agreement is with a U.S. subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (and contains a Hydro-Quebec guaranty).  You might want to point this out to some of your traders who might be interested in trading under it. 
 We just got the executed ISDA Master and guaranty in with the referenced counterparty, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (you may have noticed my email). The Counterparty wants to trade with us online immediately.  Can we get them on as an amended counterparty on Monday's list, and can we get them opened to trade financial on Monday? 
 Per Leslie Hansen, above counterparty will not be approved to trade power online.  She said she spoke to counterparty and they are a distribution company and not FERC approved to sell power.  So we will not change that profile. 
 I am looking for the merger documents dated 12/30/99 wherein Devon Energy Corp. merged with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., and PennzEnergy Exploration and Production Company, L.L.C.  If you've got a copy can you fax it to me via 646-3490.  Thanks! 
 Why do we have so many deals from Coral that need to be assigned?    Kevin Meredith@ENRON 11/06/2000 10:58 AM 
 Can someone talk to Coral so I can get out of the business of assigning "oops" trades... 
 Thanks, I appreciate it!    Cheryl Johnson@ENRON 11/06/2000 11:11 AM 
 Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  Per Leslie, not a FERC approved counterparty.  This cpy can have read-only access for US power products. Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested in trading power at this time, but will let her know when they are.  She will have to follow up with them re: their FERC approved status at that time. 
 We have received the fully executed Unanimous Written Consent of Managers of EnronOnline, LLC  dated 11/6/00, effective as of 10/11/00, which appoints Amita Gosalia, Dale Neuner and Sheri Thomas as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on behalf of EOL.  This resolution will expire one year from the date of its effectiveness.  When you execute, please sign as "Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".  The original will be filed in the minute book of EnronOnline maintained in the Corporate Secretary's Office on the 48th floor, and a copy will be provided to Lisa Lees and Amita Gosalia. 
 We have received the executed Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated 10/31/00 between the referenced counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Just an update on the status of the signing.  As of Friday, Duke supposedly had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty. Clement Abrams,  Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their concerns.  He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and give me the original for transmittal.  I'll keep you posted on how things progress... 
 Are these physical, financial or both?    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/07/2000 09:43 AM 
 Please try and open up HQ Energy Services ASAP. 
 Gaylord Container is shut down by Credit, but it should be open, so it is going to come back thru as an amended counterparty. 
 The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.  We would like to open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give them some headroom on power.  If you could let me know ASAP whether you have any issues. 
 Enron North America Corp. has executed a Consent to Assignment dated 10/05/00 with respect to the Master Repurchase Agreement dated 01/22/97 between ENA and Goldman Sachs Canada (a limited partnership), wherein Goldman Sachs Canada has assigned its position in the agreement and transactions thereunder to Goldman Sachs Canada Inc. (a corporation).  Copies of the consent will be distributed. 
 Thanks for such a prompt response!    Harry M Collins 11/07/2000 02:38 PM 
 Please add Mark Taylor to this training.  He has put it on his calendar.    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/07/2000 02:48 PM 
 I take it you signed off on this new product.  It is pretty common that we just copy the profile for a similar product for the existing 1500-2000 counterparties.  Let me know if you think this is a problem. 
 OK w/me. 
 Scott,  Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer responsible for Norway power contracts.  Mary is the head of Global Contracts here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.  Thanks for your help! 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:17 PM 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:19 PM 
 OK for me.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:20 PM 
 Sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power...! 
 Call Leslie Hansen at x36121.  She is a lawyer and will be able to help you. I am a paralegal that assists her.    Stephen Abbanat@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/07/2000 05:14 PM 
 I haven't heard anything back from you re: this approval.  The EOL people need a sign off ASAP. 
 I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC license.  He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up.    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 08:29 AM 
 I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.  There was also a few updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.  If and when Mark calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it. 
 I'm talking to their lawyer right now.  He's checking with his power team to find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as we speak!    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 09:17 AM 
 US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, we have no problem with limited liability companies.    Stephanie Sever 11/08/2000 08:52 AM 
 Thanks for the good word!    Mary Griff Gray 11/08/2000 09:42 AM 
 Can we open up ANP for gas ASAP.  They have been dying to trade.  They want to trade power but so far Credit has not given them any headroom for power and they do not appear to have a FERC license in this name.  We are working with them trying to figure out how they can trade power. 
 Coral Energy Holdings is where we have the financial master.  Are you OK with this assignment? 
 Can you please respond to Diane.  Thanks. 
 We do have an ISDA Agreement in place between Koch Energy Trading and ENA, but Anthony is correct on a number of accounts.  First, we could not put Oslo trades under this master.  It is a Local Currency form and could not be used for any non US transaction. Second, it is quite old and our forms have evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form.  Lastly, it has the old "ERMS" style collateral annex, and we would want to use an ISDA Credit Support Annex on a going forward basis.  I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson in London Legal and Rod Nelson in London Credit and getting a new master based off our current form.  Tana Jones, Houston Legal     Matthew Allan 11/09/2000 06:43 AM 
 I'm passing on for response. 
 A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the master with us and trade(s) thereunder.  He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1. I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this trades, but you might want to give them a call.  Jim McClymont at (308) 532-7118 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for each of Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. and Amerex Power, Ltd.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Bob at (713) 853-0397  if you have any comments or questions. 
 Will attend.    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/09/2000 11:01 AM 
 This counterparty is approved for all financial. 
 Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline.  By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of EnronOnline.  Thanks!    Leslie Hansen 11/09/2000 01:00 PM 
 I'm interested!  Would it be OK to invite one of my new business people from London, she doesn't know anyone in Houston yet?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/09/2000 04:01 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated October 31, 2000 between webMethods, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dovie Keprta. 
 We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't think we use it to trade under anymore.  I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  If you concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get attached for online trading. 
 ? 
 I noticed the memo too, and looked around this morning for the attachments that went with them, but couldn't find them.  When Mark calls in I'll ask him what happened to the attachments. 
 Per my conv. w/Tanya, the above master should be inactived (which I have already done in Lotus Notes) and taken off the executed Master List.  All the Dynegy Trading is done out of Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  Thanks. 
 Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.  It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party system.  That was a good thought.    Peter Keohane 11/09/2000 04:37 PM 
 Dear Mr. Dune,  At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am enclosing our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  I have also enclosed a blacklined draft showing the changes from the NDA you executed with Enron Broadband.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have an authorized officer execute two copies and return them to me for execution by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399. 
 It's just you and me tomorrow.  Soma is having furniture delivered from Star and they said they could only come between 8-12.  So shall we drive together?  Do you want to come to my house?  At what time?    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/09/2000 04:53 PM 
 Per our conv., above counterparty is OK to trade all products (except the usual credit deriv. & Argentina Gas). 
 The scary thing about those old goats being too blind to vote is that they're still driving!    Jon Chapman 11/10/2000 03:39 AM 
 Sounds good to me.  I'll see you tomorrow am!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 11/10/2000 11:44 AM 
 Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together, can you send a copy to me for our files.  Thanks! 
 We have completed the revisions to anexb.doc (the document used to prepare credit for omnibus confirmations).  It has been moved into the attorney forms bank and is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/anexb.doc.  The prior form has been moved to atty.fms/swaps/old forms/oldanexb.doc. 
 At the request of Paul Finken, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please mail or fax an executed copy to me.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.  My fax number is (713) 636-3490. 
 Michael, thought you might enjoy this! 
 Here's another spin on the election ballot! 
 Just a note that the new bandwidth is still in EBS Legal being run thru the legal and regulatory hoops.  As soon as I hear from Robbi or Marie that it's approved, I'll pass on the word. 
 I sent Scott Sefton and email and he responded that at this time he doesn't know the exact Brits that will be coming for the conference, he expects 6-8. I think we should order 8 mens shirts in large.  So I don't think you need to email him or Michael Brown.  Thanks for your help! 
 Attached is that chart that were supposed to replace with the current one on price volatility.  I tried to open it up, but it was all gobbeldy gook. Maybe you could print it out for me and then I could take a look at it and if it looks OK we could just replace it with existing one.  Thanks! 
 NYMEX is trying to get more competitive... 
 Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of "Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we are trying to carve those transactions out.  Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 11/13/2000 10:09 AM 
 I forwarded your agreement to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group, and she would prefer to work from our form if possible.  Let me know if this is a problem.    "John Nugent" <jnugent@purchasepooling.com> 11/10/2000 03:06 PM Please respond to jnugent 
 Jennifer McQuade with EOL called checking on the status of your conv. w/Elzear Lemieux with cpy.  Have you resolved the ETA questions yet? 
 I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause any problems...    Greg Johnston 11/10/2000 11:20 AM 
 At the request of Dovie Keprta in our eMarket Services Group, I am enclosing a draft of our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement for David Endicott's review.

Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments you might have.  We look forward to hearing from you.

 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Idea Integration Corp. (d/b/a Idea Integration) and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC dated 11/9/00.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Per my conv. w/cpy and Credit, please open the referenced counterparty to transact all financial. 
 Thanks, I appreciate your help!...will I be able to get it tomorrow? 
 Will attend!    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/13/2000 03:02 PM

 We have received an executed financial Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:   October 23, 2000  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:   Power Authority of the State of New York  Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp, Lumber & Paper, Foreign Exchange  Confirming Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Choice of Law:   New York  For those of you keeping track, this brings us to 470 executed financial agreements! 
 Attached is a current list of the NDA's I am working on for the EOL and Net Works teams.  Please take the time to look at this list and confirm the status of any NDA's you are interested in. 
 My favorite election comment to date comes from Gore who said today he was not "focused on the contest, but our democracy".  Such a thoughtful, selfless person! 
 For this list of amends, my comments mean:  Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should have no impact on my prior approvals. Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas) Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's changes. 
 Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name change.  Thanks.    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/10/2000 09:25 AM 
 Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response. Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.  Per your voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have reviewed.  I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I will hear from him tonight or not.  If youcould email or fax me the document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I hear back from him.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark. 
 I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to meet the stove repair guy.  Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean up day?    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 09:08 AM 
 The big switch here is that we're shutting Public Service Electric and Gas Commpany for power.  All their power will be traded out of PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC. 
 Perfect, it had another meeting scheduled for 3:30 I had to attend!    Lola Willis@ENRON 11/14/2000 09:24 AM 
 Can you email me your form?  How about lunch today?    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/14/2000 09:31 AM 
 Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at 713/636-3490.  Thanks!    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/10/2000 10:01 AM 
 You are the best!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/14/2000 09:59 AM 
 If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of America, shouldn't your spreadsheet reflect that name?  I'm confused.    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/14/2000 09:57 AM 
 So, back to my original question, is this a name change? 
 I will be taking Friday p.m. off to meet stove repair guy & contractor. 
 Yeah!  Also, I spoke to Dalzenia and she is going to move that dirt around by the fence.    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 10:21 AM 
 Per a call from Rod today, our executed master list hasn't picked up the following name change:  Lomak Petroleum Inc. to Range Resources Corporation.  Thanks! 
 Can you fax me the merger documents to 646-3490.  Thanks! 
 Anyone have these merger docs? 
 But I did respond.  I said "yeah!" on the thermostat.  You're confusing me...I don't know where Michelle is.  She should be in town.  She must just be busy at work.    "Louis Fernandez Co." <lofeco@ev1.net> 11/14/2000 01:32 PM 
 Now don't be afraid to tell us what you really think...!    Peter Keohane 11/14/2000 12:35 PM 
 As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of the paralegals in the financial trading group:  We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie Panus.  Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron Broadband.  Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group:  Tana Jones:  Primarily all EnronOnline issues.  (1) I am the primary Legal contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.  Individual contract problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.  (2) As my time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with my name on, feel free to call me.  Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions:  Can be directed to any of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.  Copies of Executed Masters:  Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, she can get you copies.  Merger/Name Changes:  Stephanie Panus  Executed Master List:  Susan Bailey  I hope this straightens things out! 
 OK for me! 
 OK for me! 
 This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.  We have received documentation that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.   Is Credit OK with this merger? 
 I am sending down this list, with all counterparties approved except Calpine, which I am still waiting on Credit approval on the Calpine Power Services/Energy Services merger.  As soon as I get their sign off I will send down an amended spreadsheet. 
 Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State effective 11/1/00, Calpine Power Services Company, a California corporation has been merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., a Delaware corporation.  The ISDA Master Agreement with Calpine Power Services Company dated 10/20/99 will be changed accordingly. 
 Attached is the Annex B for Catalytica. 
 Nope, it's a merger.    Tanya Rohauer 11/14/2000 03:35 PM 
 Here's that email of "Bushism's". 
 I just can't help myself!  - DemBallot.gif 
 I believe that this was authored by James Carville:   NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach.  "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."  One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.  "It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said  a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment." 
 Attached is the revised list giving Calpine Energy Services the same approval as Calpine Power Services (except no Argentina gas). 
 Per the request of Sara, I am attaching Annex A and Annex B to the Omnibus Confirmation for the referenced counterparty. 
 Bandwidth now OK per Marie.  She should have GTC to you no later than noon tomorrow.    Lisa Lees 11/07/2000 03:08 PM 
 No, we don't currently have Alberta Prepay docs.  Greg has finally gotten them all and is preparing sets. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please sign the NDA and return it to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.

 Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross numbers to match my list:  "Net long or short position in all months combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, with the positions not netted out. 
 At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.  P.S.  Do we have any particular deadline for getting them approved?  Thanks!     Stephanie Sever 11/15/2000 10:02 AM 
 You guys crack me up!    Peter Keohane 11/15/2000 10:50 AM 
 Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our Legal sign off by Friday.  I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper description for our group.  Thanks for your help! 
 Mieco 471 
 Heck, we all know sending an agreement out for signature doesn't mean getting them back signed.  If we had every agreement signed we sent out, we'd be at 1000!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/15/2000 04:12 PM 
 Awais,  I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.  When can I expect the remaining descriptions? 
 Jay, this one is from one of our London lawyers to me and a Canadian lawyer. 
 These last two were especially good.  I guess the best thing about this mess is that it has provoked such good humor!    Jon Chapman 11/16/2000 05:20 AM 
 You guys are cracking me up.  I had tears streaming down my face this morning!  (hey, but I thought y'all played "American Football" too, maybe I'm confused).    Peter Keohane 11/16/2000 09:50 AM 
 At the request of Leslie Hansen, I am enclosing a clean and redlined draft of the revised NDA. 
 Yes! 
 We have received the fully executed Confidential Nondisclosure Agreement dated 11/13/00 between Sapient Corporation and Enron Net works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Can you please direct one of the paralegals to assist Angeline with getting this documentation in place.  I thought Susan would be appropriate because she handles internal masters, but I understand she is only responsible for RMT Masters. 
 I told the online people I had to shut them down for power because we didn't have them on any FERC lists.  Below is their ph. # (when you get a minute!). 
 I have passed your request to Mark Taylor to assign to another paralegal.  I no longer handle the day to day swap work, I am working on Online predominately now.  By copy of this email, I will ask Mark to let you know what paralegal he has assigned this to.    Angeline Poon 11/15/2000 03:25 AM 
 RUSH BELOW. 
 This counterparty is approved for all products except power and Argentina gas (no credit deriv too). 
 (g) Additional Event of Default.  The following will constitute an additional Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a):  (ix) (i) in the case of Party A, if Enron Corp. ceases to own, directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party A having ordinary voting power; or (ii) in the case of Party B, if Enron Corp. ceases to own directly or indirectly, one hundred percent (100%) or more of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Party B having ordinary voting power. 
 We only send this to the legal team that follows, not the distribution that Brad sends it to. 
 Attached is Annex A for the Omnibus, revised only to change "ECT" to "ENA". 
 What do you think? 
 On First Energy, we originally had them open for financial and shut down for power, no change to that earlier approval. 
 I thought this might be helpful. 
 Thanks Justy, you're the best!    Justin Boyd 11/17/2000 02:33 AM 
 All the counterparties below can trade physical, and only the two I've marked below in red can trade financial.    Camille Gerard@ENRON 11/17/2000 09:29 AM 
 Just a reminder, starting today until I get back after the holidays, send the counterparty approval lists to my assistant Taffy Milligan, and she will forward them to the Legal team, so they can be working on their approvals while I'm gone. 
 You are right.  They need to get the date on their calendars, and pass it on to anyone they might think is coming. 
 Per your request, I am attaching the Executed Masters List.  Please feel free to call me anytime I can be of help! 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated 11/15/00 between the referenced Counterparty and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/20/00 between the referencec Counterparty and Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 FYI 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. Please note, that we have recently upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I will forward it to them. 
 With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue.  With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.    Denis O'Connell 11/22/2000 06:05 AM 
 Can you please give Greg Johnston, Peter Keohane and Mark Powell, lawyers in our Calgary office, as well as their assistants Linda Sietzema and Sharon Crawford,  full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreements database. Can you please let me know when their access has been granted.  Thanks! 
 Per our discussion, the email for that website is www.utilityconnection.com. 
 Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.  Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you about potential metals customers?  Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?  Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him? 
 As usual, you're the best!    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/27/2000 05:10 PM 
 On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).  It helps me and some of the non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..  Thanks! 
 On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.  If we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.  For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them open for all financial except Australian power.  (Also, shutting down Argentina gas...) 
 This link should be ok.    Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 11/28/2000 09:38 AM 
 Thanks Lisa!    Lisa Lees 11/28/2000 10:07 AM 
 FYI 
 Not wanting to duplicate any efforts, I think Laurie Meyer, a paralegal in Alan Aronowitz's group, is going to send me copies of the Australian ISDA's when they come in.  Thanks for the offer!    Jana Morse@ENRON 11/20/2000 11:01 AM 
 Mark,  There has never been a time in our Group before where any member of our Group was cut off from mass distributions that were sent to all of our client base and member of the Group but me.  If the intent is to cut me off and make me feel isolated from the Group and my friends, clients and customers and associates it is working! 
 I don't know who is going to work on this one, but I just wanted to remind you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the TVA... 
 I was just speaking to Ed Sacks, and he asked if we could add a new Credit person to our distribution lists, Wendy Conwell, who will be working with Ed on the power counterparties.  Her ext. is 30699. 
 I checked with Sara, and Thursday at 2:30 pm is OK with us.  Just let us know if the time changes.  Should we come to Bill's office? 
 Matt,  Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have (like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):  Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals) Weather Derivatives Credit Derivatives  Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products we trade.  Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.    Thanks! 
 Thanks for the heads up.  Let me know when you need help...    Sara Shackleton 11/28/2000 04:34 PM 
 My copy had redlines.  I passed the comments on to Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our Group for review.    Bruce Harris@ENRON 11/28/2000 05:20 PM 
 Sara, is there a reason I'm being sent this?    Angela Davis@ENRON 11/29/2000 08:54 AM 
 Will do.  Thanks for the heads up!    David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/28/2000 07:54 PM 
 Matt,  As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all products.  I am asking because until recently I have not been approving Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.  It has been my understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading physical products.  I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.  Should that be my continuing practice?    Matthias Lee 11/28/2000 07:38 PM 
 Ditto as to my feelings of isolation and punishment. 
 I've made my flight reservations home for XMAS, and they should only have me out Friday, Dec. 22.  My flight returns very early on the morning of Wednesday, Dec. 27, so if there are no delays I should be in the office late sometime that morning. 
 Will do!    Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/29/2000 10:29 AM 
 Can you please add my assistant, Taffy Milligan, on for full edit access to the referenced database.  Can you also delete Shari Stack from edit capability, as she is no longer in our group.  Also, can you provide me a list of the individuals with full edit access.  I need to check to see if there are other people that have left our group or legal and credit that should be taken off.  Thanks!

 We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement dated 11/29/00 with the referenced counterparty.  A copy will be provided to Dovie. 
 I just spoke to Tanya and she was going for either (1) Bloomberg published a report that said energy supply was going to be low for the next couple of years, or (2) the California thing.  She hadn't heard the Energizer bunny story. 
 Just an update, Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, will be working on the Confirmation, her direct no. is x34737, and Stephanie Panus, another paralegal in our group, will be working on the ISDA Master, her no is x53249.  When you have that address and contact information ready for the counterparty, why don't you email it directly to Stephanie.  If I can be of further help, just let me know! 
 No problem, always happy to help!    Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/29/2000 04:24 PM 
 Please note:  we are intermediary on a deal we are structuring between Interliant and PurchasePooling, so we have added them as a party to receive the confidential information.  If you work off this form you would, of course, want to strike the reference to PurchasePooling in Paragraph 5. 
 If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.  I think Mark's input is the most important. 
 It was good to hear from you!  We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.  It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called "African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging. It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!).  I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby.  I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs "guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.  As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.  But, I guess, it's a start...  I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!     Kyle.Jones@radianz.com 11/29/2000 05:07 PM 
 You can take my assistant Taffy Milligan off these emails again.  Thanks!    Adnan Patel@ENRON 11/29/2000 04:49 PM 
 Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority... 
 No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component.    Richard Sage 11/30/2000 10:52 AM 
 I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're OK.    Sheri Thomas 11/30/2000 10:27 AM 
 The referenced counterparty has applied in London for a password application.  Can you let me know if this presents any problems for each of your trading groups products?  Thanks! 
 FYI, I understand from our natural gas people that they do not like the EnergyGateway form of GTC and want to transact on their platform with only counterparties where we have a master agreement in place. 
 I've got some changes to make to that assignment and then I'm ready to send it to them.  Do you have a contact for me to send it to?    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/30/2000 11:06 AM 
 Will the LME transactions go under a relevant financial master, if any, or will they always be standalone under the GTC? 
 Per the request of Bill Bradford, I am attaching our standard Material Adverse Change clauses. 
 Anthony,  We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other parties, including, other Enron affiliates.  All requests by non-Enron North America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to the paralegals in the Swap Group to determine if the agreement will allow us to provide copies to such affiliate, or whether we would  need counterparty approval to do so.  With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and let you know whether they present any problem.  Andrew Wells 11/30/2000 03:00 PM 
 Thanks, I'll fax it over to her today!    Melissa Ann Murphy 11/30/2000 03:27 PM 
 Does Dr. Batsell's company have a name?    Kal Shah 11/30/2000 03:18 PM 
 FYI,  Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.    Richard Sage 11/30/2000 10:52 AM 
 We're going to have a Legal happy hour tomorrow at the Blue Agave, and it would be no party without you there.  Hope you can make it (and ask any of your buddies in Legal you want to ask!). 
 Please forward this to 70 of your closest friends... 
 We do have a Credit Support Annex in place.  Once we sign the ENA agreement, we will make your requests to DB.    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 12/05/2000 06:08 AM 
 On your counterparty list for the UK, have you identified which counterparties are utilities or governmentals?  If you have that would help me alot.  Thanks! 
 Another good one! 
 Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a "governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All other US products appear to be OK. 
 It was making me sleepy just looking at it!    Genia FitzGerald 12/05/2000 10:41 AM 
 See if this works... 
 We have received the following fully executed documents back from EnergyGateway:  1.  Provider Agreement dated 12/04/00.  This Agreement provides that the Monthly Membership Fee of $1,500 shall be waived for the first six months of the contract, starting November 30, 2000 thru May 31, 2001.  2.  Natural Gas Marketplace General Terms and Conditions dated 11/30/00.  A copy will be sent to Sheri Thomas and Craig Breslau. 
 A woman named Janette Bertel at McLaren Energy just left a message for Genia who had just sent them a power master, that they also want to get an ISDA Master in place with us.  The woman's phone no is 819/986-4616.  If you could send up some credit for this, we'd appreciate it! 
 The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!    Clare.Godson@AllenOvery.com 12/05/2000 08:41 AM 
 For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements. Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, Team Swap is looking strong. 
 Bob,  Per your request, attached are the online trading GTC's.  It looks like Mark has all of them, not just financial.  I'm going to talk to Stacy about this when she gets in, because I know she was talking about adding it in.  I'll get back to you. 
 My strategy on hand recounts, is that if if the opposition wants one, they'll have to do it themselves!      Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 12/05/2000 04:14 PM 
 Justin & Matt,  Beth Cowan is a member here of the EnronOnline Marketing Team.  Her Counterparty, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, would like to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ECTRIC (per Beth, they don't like our form of GTC).  We already have a Local Currency form in place with ENA, but obviously, that would not be an appropriate form for London to use.  It is also on our form of Schedule from 1996, which we wouldn't want to work off of either.  In addition, I've checked the Confidentiality Provisions, and they do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent.  Saying all that, could you please help Beth out... 
 Who is Robert Mcgrory?  Is he a member of the Legal Dept? 
 With respect to your request:  1.  I take it "ECTRL" is the Master Agreement between ECTRIC and ENA.  All the internal masters are kept in Houston.  I will send you a copy. 2.  Moravske Naftove is an agreement that London Legal got in place.  We do not have copies here, I suggest you contact Matt Dawson to get a copy. 3.  Risk Mangement & Trading/ECTRIC-I will send you a copy. 4.  State Street Bank, as Trustee/ECTRIC-this was for the Cash VI Project and is not for general trading purposes.  I will send copies to you. 5.  Elf Trading S.A./ECTRIC-London Legal should have copies.  Contact Matt Dawson    Andrew Wells 11/30/2000 03:00 PM 
 At the request of George Zivic, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at 713/853-3399 or Leslie Hansen, Senior Counsel, at 713/835-6121 if you have any comments or questions. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a copy of our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399, or email me your comments. 
 The meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm to discuss netting between the physical and financial contracts will be held in Bill Bradford's office. 
 Matt and Denis,  Can you help us with this NDA we need executed for an EnronCredit. meeting on Monday?  If you could print it out on EnronCredit.com letterhead and have Denis initial it for signature.  Because of time, Leslie can't initial this before we execute it, but we promise she will initial it before we send it out to the customer.  Then, can you have it executed by an officer of EnronCredit.com and return it to me at fax nol 713/646-3490.  Thanks for your help! 
 Here are the next four descriptions.  Per Awais's message below, he is still trying to get these by today.  I know it is a little late....let me know if this will be an issue.  Please give me your comments so I can coordinate responses.  Thanks! 
 I see you two are on the Reliant agreement.  Deedy Russo, who is manager of contracts at Reliant, asked if we could contact them about getting an ISDA Master in place to replace the old ERMS Agreement.  She siad we should contact Janna Lynn Galloway, a paralegal there.  Her number is 713/207-5893. 
 It is in Mark Taylor's hands.  Unfortunately, he is out sicke    Dawn C Kenne 12/07/2000 02:03 PM 
 This is a Mark Taylor Question. 
 We have received an executed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between Analytica, Inc. and Enron Net Works, LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels and Kal Shah. 
 We have lots of ISDA's in place with "Southerns", "Southern" who?    Chris Gaffney 12/08/2000 09:09 AM 
 We have an ISDA Master Agreement (Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction) in place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P.  I am a little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services Agreement.  Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade. If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.    Chris Gaffney 12/08/2000 09:24 AM 
 Any thoughts on how you would like to approach this? 
 Mark Taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following market descriptions.  Obviously, for you, the weather one is yours, I sent the pulp & paper to Sara.  We need to review the market descriptions from a legal perspective only.  Awais is trying to get them back by today.  Let me know if that will present a problem.   He still hasn't got the liquids ones written, he says we'll have those by Monday.  I am coordinating the responses, so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal to Awais.  Thanks for your help! 
 I would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the ISDA Master Agreement we recently executed with this Counterparty to limit their financial trading to energy commodity trading only.  This counterparty is NOT approved to trade any other products including , but not limited to, weather, pulp & paper, plastics, steel, metals, interest rate & currency, fx, or credit derivatives. 
 I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar to our FERC licensing.  Thanks! 
 So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm. Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions. Dinner sounds good to me....    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/08/2000 04:32 PM 
 Oops, already had to make change! 
 Can she get it wrong twice within 1 minute?  The answer is YES! 
 For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not want that to change.  I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting them down for physical gas. 
 Are you there.  I tried calling and no one picked up.  I'm ready to go...    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/08/2000 05:03 PM 
 ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?  Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in place.       Jan Wilson 12/11/2000 07:26 AM 
 I haven't done anything.  I was waiting for you to get back in to discuss this...    Sara Shackleton 12/11/2000 08:16 AM 
 Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill today about 3:30 pm our time.  I have the originals and asked her to tell me what address she wants me to send the originals to.  I didn't date the front page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.  I'm working on getting the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same package, maybe tomorrow.   I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do. 
 The MAC clauses are attached to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I will have a sample copy walked down to you. 
 My new address is:  1920 Banks St., Houston  77098.  I would love to come to your dinner party!    Mary Cook 12/11/2000 08:38 AM 
 Yep, we had a nice time.  I tried calling you about 4:00 yesterday, but there was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go.    "Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells.com> 12/11/2000 10:53 AM 
 What's the scoop on getting this signed? 
 Thanks!    Stephanie Sever 12/11/2000 11:14 AM 
 I sent you the regular online approval by mistake.  Below are clickpaper. 
 Per our conversation.  1.  Replace front outdoor light fixture. 2.  Add door numbers to bottom of front door (1920 Banks). 3.  Add door knocker to middle of front  door (cute kitty door knocker!). 4.  Replace light in front sunroom with new light. 5.  Fix window in back sunroom so it locks or closes (I'm afraid it would be easy to pry open, and we have had recent robberies in neighborhood). 
 Attached is another NDA we need to get signed ASAP.  If you could help us with this, we'd appreciate it! 
 Sure, I'll take care of it!    Sara Shackleton 12/11/2000 03:06 PM 
 The referenced Counterparty wants to trade physical power.  Leslie has signed off on them from a Legal standpoint, but Credit still has concerns and has assigned them no power headroom.  I spoke to Jeff Mansfield in their Legal Dept. and he is going to have his Credit guy call Ed Sacks tomorrow. 
 Tana will attend.    Sheri L Cromwell 12/11/2000 04:45 PM 
 I have no idea if it was or not.  Would you like to pass it on, or do you want me to?  Does he know what's going on? 
 With respect to the trade done today with Gases y Graneles Liquidos S.A., please find attached a Chilean Annex A for an Omnibus form of confirmation. Please attach this form and make an election for NY law as the choice of law.  Along with the fax of the Confirmation to the Counterparty, please also fax a form of IRS Form W-8BEN and ask the Counterparty to complete the form and return it to us.  Craig, can you talk to the Counterparty and make sure they send us back the tax form?! 
 Per the email below, this has been approved.  I had to revise the attached copy to fix the header and page break, so use the copy I sent you.  Thanks for your help! 
 Can I sent a copy of this down to Credit?  How about Joe Hunter?    Mark Taylor 12/12/2000 09:08 AM 
 As we discussed, I am attaching our proposed form of Bilateral and Enron Protected Party Non-Disclosure Agreements.  Please direct any comments you may have to Mark Greenberg at x58897.  We appreciate your help with this! 
 I would, I will contribute $25.  I have to walk over to the bank to get some cash.    Sheri L Cromwell 12/12/2000 11:53 AM 
 fyi- 
 Awais  Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster to this effect. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a clean and redlined copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement revised to include your comment.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have the agreement executed and return a copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron and return a copy to you via fax. 
 Whatever Tom decides to mirror these two new products from, ditto from me!    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 01:56 PM 
 Ditto Tom.    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 02:36 PM 
 Ditto Tom.    Lisa Lees 12/12/2000 02:40 PM 
 Attached is my proposed form of Amendment, which would delete the old style "ERMS" Collateral Annex and replace it with an ISDA Credit Support Annex. Tanya, please take a look at the stairstep, and the segregation of collateral provisions. 
 Sure!    Lora Sullivan@ENRON 12/13/2000 09:19 AM 
 Can you please send me a copy of the fully executed NDA for our files. Thanks! 
 You can come up to our area here on 38 and reveiw any contracts you would like.  We are located directly in front on the glass doors on 38.    Carrie Richardson@ENRON 12/13/2000 10:32 AM 
 Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business groups for approval.  If we are duplicating your work, or doing something contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try to coordinate our responses.  Otherwise, we will continue the review we are doing. 
 Taffy, can you please copy these masters for Carrie ASAP.  Thanks. 
 I just left you both another message about this NDA.  Their lawyer is calling from NY, and we need it signed now.  His name is Robert Harris, his ph is 212/984-9112 and his fax is 212/984-9111. 
 Matthew Dawson 12/13/2000 12:33 PM 
 Did you draft this? 
 Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of law and arbitration language in it.  I send it with a caveat that this draft is 2 years old.  The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the choice of law or arbitration language. 
 Derek,  I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch. 
 Susan Bailey in our Group sends out this list.  Your should direct your request to her.  Thanks!    Stacey Vallejo 12/13/2000 02:30 PM 
 Please find attached our proposed Second Amendment, which would replace the current form of collateral annex attached to the ISDA Master Agreement we have in place with an ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto.  If you have any questions or comments concerning the form please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-5620.  Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Dept. can handle any credit questions you have.  Her number is (713) 853-3263.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this. 
 With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company, although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather, Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in them would prohibit this type of transaction.  Can you contact whomever sent you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of Association to us.  Thanks! 
 Link --> 
 Here's the final liquids descriptions! 
 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any comments or questions. 
 Attached please find Annex B for Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund deals nos. QD7357.1 and QE0910.2. 
 Alan, is this what you are talking about?  I forwarded your voicemail on to Mark T. 
 Attached are the revised descriptions for SO2 and NOX.  Jeff Hodge signed off on the Canada description and said it looked fine in its current form.  I will be faxing you this evening our comments to Natural Gas.  You should have received weather by separate email from Shari Stack.  Coal should be coming shortly, paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it to you on Tuesday.  The person responsible for power is out of the office, but will be back in town on Tuesday, and we will get you her comments then. Thank you for your kind patience. 
 FYI 
 I will be attending the online presentation today at 4. 
 We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX for 1999.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary Companies.  My last list was dated June 8, 1998.  Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help! 
 Here's coal.  That just leaves power and any revisions to pulp & paper we may get from the business people. 
 I will have the master walked down to you shortly. 
 Thursday's OK with me. 
 Awais,  I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney in our group, Shari Stack.  If that is the one you are talking about, it should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling Steve Kean and see if I get a response. 
 Shari, Can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know if its ok.  Thanks. 
 I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all these descriptions done was the end of today.  She said she would pass the word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.  Let me know if that doesn't happen. 
 Either day is fine for me. 
 De nada! 
 I guess I still need your market descriptions for LPG, Oil & Oil Products and Plastics and Petrochem.  Will I have them by the end of the day? 
 Thanks Shari! 
 Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.  My goal is to get everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve before I have to file by June 11th.  When the financials are ready I need t
