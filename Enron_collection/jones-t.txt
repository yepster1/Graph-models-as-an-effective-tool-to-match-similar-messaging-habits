  Can you please provide me with the clean copies of the licenses Angela is referring to?  If I need to come pick them up to copy them, give me a call and I will do so.  Thanks! 
 Justy, thanks for your quick response.  I heard back from Edmund too, and he gave me the name of a V&E lawyer he has used in London for Russian law and Anne Koehler and I gave him a quick call.  Doug Glass.   So we switched it to NY law and ICC arbitration rules and are giving it a go.  Thanks for your help!  I can't believe our business guy call 2 hours before a lunch meeting with a Russian company and think it's business as usual! 
 I just spoke to Stephanie Sever with the EOL team, and she said this counterparty has been approved and should migrate tonight and they will send them a password out tomorrow. 
 I just agreed to the changes on the phone with Bob Klein and am going to finalize the agreement and fax it to him tomorrow and then follow-up with originals. 
  Are you having our copy walked up to me? 
 I know the online team is looking for people with paralegal experience.  Your contact would be Lisa Lees.  Lunch some other time?  Thursday or Friday?  I already have plans today and tomorrow... 
 I'll put you down too! 
  Done.  I was waiting for the EOL team to get in a new Password Application and no one told me they got it in.  I just went in and approved them. 
 Per our conversation last week, please ensure that Mark Taylor and I are your initial point of contact with respect to compliance with and/or violations by Enron North America Corp. with respect to NYMEX position limits.  Please fax Mark Taylor a copy of any correspondence with respect to our position limits.  Your assistance with this will help us monitor and maintain Enron's compliance with NYMEX rules.

 At the request of Anne Koehler, I am attaching our word version of the ISDA Schedule and Paragraph 13.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service. 
 Is there a Canadian power GTC? 
 What is the nature of the business you are discussing?  Also, do you want me to send this by email?  If so, I will need thir email address. 
 Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:  1.  "executed" 2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master 3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it 4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master 5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement  Thanks for your attention herewith. 
  Any conflicts? 
 Brandon,  I need the full legal name & address of this company.  Thanks... 
  Any conflicts? 
 Another NDA.  The correct legal name of this entity is Foundry Networks, Inc.

 He's already signed for our side.  We're done. 
 There is a meeting of the Name/Change Merger Group Meeting on Monday at 1:00 pm in 49c4 to talk about timing of suspensions.  I don't know what, if any, relevance this will have for us, but since you do the name changes/mergers, I thought you might need to attend.  I wanted to forward you the email, but once I clicked yes, I will attend, it went away. 
 At the request of Brandon Wax, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no.

 Xavier, what group are you in? 
 NDA for COMYSY Information Technology Services, Inc. 
 Attached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far.  Tanya suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close-out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into Greg Whiting to see if that is the case.  I spoke to Craig Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that.  He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk.  What are your thoughts on that?  There appear to be two International Paper Deals.  Craig Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.  There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.  Craig, any knowledge of this other one?  No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no. Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no. 49011.1 for $442,000.  That just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on Debbie's list with no copy. 
 This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update? 
 Both I and Stephanie Panus plan on attending. 
 At the request of Nick Tubach, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit. 
  Here is the guaranty from Trans Alta. 
 713/661-5865 
 Thanks for the email.  I just got out of an all morning meeting.  I had already drafted the agreement for APB Europe.  I'll redraft it as directed. 
  It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them. 
 We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:  Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies  Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2 Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof  Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies  Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone. Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.  Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.   I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.  We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment. 
  OK for me. 
  I spoke to Mark Taylor and we would like Dave removed from this corporation as well.  We can date this revocation effective as of 10/1/01 as well.  We really appreciate your help with these resolutions.  I am circulating the EPMI resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed. 
  Jay,  I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this. 
  We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.  HOW GOES IT MARK???? 
  tom,  All of this relates to a broker Bob Shults wants to open up to trade on EOL.  When you have a minute can you give me or Mark a call so we can sort out who we want to trade with.  Thanks. 
  Another NDA.  This one is for the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
  Attached please find the NDA for transmittal to Bo Collins. 
 We have received an executed side letter agreement dated 08/10/01 with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. ("El Paso) which states that "notwithstanding the provisions of the Electronic Trading Agreement or the product descriptions on the EOL website, all financial derivative transactions entered into by El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. on the Web Site which are listed by either ENA or ECC will be deemed to be entered into between El Paso and ENA and will be governed the the ISDA Master Agreement between El Paso and ENA dated 12/1/99".  Copies will be distributed. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our form of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897or Bob Shults at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 We will also be getting these Mid-Market EIM Group Customer Lists on a going forward basis.  I spoke to Credit and for right now we will only be approving these counterparties to trade physical steel.  As with the regular online trading lists, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN ONE DAY, I will take it that you do not have any legal issues with the counterparties below trading. 
  Know anything about these deals? 
 Any conflicts? 
 At the request of Ross Mesquita, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 OK for you? 
 How can we find out who has a clue? 
  Nothing to report 
  Weren't we also going to get a printer in the area? 
 Not unless it's critical.  All the attorneys are out at an offsite today.  Can this wait til Monday or is this critical? 
 I will get them done today. 
 I will get them done today. 
  Can you change on my calendar.  Thanks! 
 This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.  We figure they are using the website for price discovery.  If I do not hear back from you within 24 hours whether London Legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals, it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products. 
  Per Stephanie's request, attached is an updated list. 
  I have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms.  Kim. if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me I would be most appreciative. 
 Lance,  Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks! 
  This counterparty has been updated. 
 Pretty funny!  If we could only do it for real! 
 I got a call from my buddy Mike Mulligan with Paribas in NY last night asking me to see if I can't check with you on the status of the guaranty he is trying to get in place with Enron Metals Limited.  He says he has been trying to get this in place with London for some time.  Is there some particular problem holding up this guaranty?  Is there anthing I can do to faciliate getting this guaranty to Paribas?  Please let me know... 
 I just had a voice mail from "Christine" at National Bank of Canada wanting to make a margin call and not knowing who here to call.  Can someone please call her.  Her number is 514/394-7567.  Thanks. 
  OK for me. 
 You are the best! 
  Any conflicts? 
  Erica,  Is 2Advance Studios their correct legal legal name?  Is there an Inc. or Corp. or anything there tacked on the end? 
  If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue? 
 Per our discussion, attached is the referenced NDA for transmittal to counterparty. 
 We also have lots of agreements between internal counterparties.  I also owe you more comments...I haven't forgotten... 
  Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't? 
  I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill. 
 There has been a little confusion about how this Counterparty wishes to be set up on EnronOnline, and after talking to the Counterparty, Darren Vanek in Credit, and Mary Cook we have come to the following agreement:  The counterparty will be (and I think already may be?) set up in the GCP System as Vector Pipeline, LP  I told the Counterparty that special Confirmation Templates would be prepared for this Counterparty and the signature line should be prepared as follows:  Vector Pipeline, LP, by its Managing General Partner, Vector Pipeline, LLC  By:  _____________________ Name:  __________________ Title:  ____________________  This form of signature block should be used for all EnronOnline and any offline trades for counterparty as well.  The Password Application has been executed by the Counterparty correctly so there is no need to have him re-apply. 
 Travis,  I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.  We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy. 
 Patrick,  Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them? 
 This cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."  We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.  What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you? 
 On 10/17/01 List, is this an ECP? 
  This was a good one, not a joke one. 
  That was good Kyle.  I have a few of the better bin Laden joke ones I'll forward on to you... 
  Here's one of the two humorous things.  I've been getting a lot of this bin= Laden humor stuff, but these two are my favorites so far. 
 Please send originals to me for handling.  I will give a copy to you. 
 Lance,  I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable? 
  Here's the other... 
 In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the Enron Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:  1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones 2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address 3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer 4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation. 5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up. 6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.  Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance. 
  This one isn't funny, but it's good... 
 John, that was great! 
 Re: Experian we need:  1.  Full Legal Name and Address 2.  Mark wants a more exact description of the nature of your discussions 3.  An email address so we can send it directly to counterparty 
  Any conflicts? 
  This counterparty was approved by Legal on Friday. 
  The actual name of the counterparty on this one is Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation. 
 Mary Cook wants me to put together a list of people's home ph, cell no's/pagers, in case we need to call in help during the holidays.  Can you provide me with your info in case we get surprised and have to set up additonal data rooms.  Much thanks! 
 At the request of Kim Detiveaux, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  OK for me. 
 De nada... 
  Just an FYI, my notes in my database reflect that Tri-State Generation is a Colorado Cooperative... 
  OK for me. 
 She needs to get a copy from London, I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson.  We do not have copies of London's masters. 
 They are settled, but not executed.  We have sent the ETA amendment out to the DB lawyer for signature, but we have not gotten it back signed.  I'll give here a call. 
  Do any of you have any problems with keeping these trades as they are now that we've figured out what they are.  If not we'll just keep them as they were... 
 Thanks Lance! 
 I would try Tom Moran x33017. 
  Attached is additional  correspondence from TransAlta re: the merger and guaranty info I sent you on 10/5/01.  Can you please contact TransAlta and let them know you will be handling this.  Thanks. 
  FYI, this came in and has been passed on to Stephanie Panus for handling. 
 It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest!  Anytime...  The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning...right after we announced our current earnings last week, The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders, non-disclosure of profits, etc., and have kept up with this story since last week, we have had shareholder lawsuits, SEC inquiries, our stock has taken a dive down to $15 today, down from $33 when the story first ran, and $87 since the beginning of the year.  Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight.  Anyway, you may to check the WSJ website and catch up...  Also,  I have a new boyfriend, my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months, that seems to be going well.  So that's all my news...  XXOO 
  FYI 
 Do you have copies of any of the following NDAs?  At the Moment True Exchange BizBots 
  You've want Puget Sound for approval to trade east physical power on above list, but Leslie Hansen will not approve per note below. 
  Mark,  Mark Greenberg asked me to check with you to see if Enron Corp. ever got Confidentiality Agreements in place with either True Exchange or BizBots?  Can you please let me know.  Thanks! 
 I can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are.  Can you meet with me? 
  Can you let me know whether Enron Corp. has any Confidentiality Agreements with the counterparties below.  Thanks! 
 We have received Articles of Merger from the referenced counterparty evidencing the merger of BP Exploration & Oil Inc. with and into Amoco Oil Company, with the surviving entity being Amoco Oil Company, which shall continue under the name of BP Products North America Inc., such merger being effective 10/11/01.  Copies are being sent to the usual Houston distribution.  I am sending a copy of this email to London Credit and Legal because I understand ECTRIC has done some financial trades with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  Houston Legal is awaiting Houston Credit's approval of the merger and its impact on our ISDA Master and underlying credit. 
  We appreciate all Credit does for us! 
 Nope, thanks! 
 Attached is the proposed form of NDA for your approval. 
 =20 
  Kay,  We will be getting this NDA in place for Williams, we are not exactly sure yet which of the Williams companies it will be for. 
  It appears that the fax you moved in on the 33rd floor was actively being used by Scott Tholan and his assistant on that floor (x58889).  Can your people please move it back ASAP and find us another one.  Thanks. 
      P.S.  The Mahonia ISDA Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex is attached to the Confirm. 
 At the request of Marc Eichmann, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.  Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.  Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"  MUCH THANKS!!! 
 Thanks for your help! 
 Thanks for your help Kate! 
 I just got handed another list...  Can I get the datasheets for the following companies:  Enron Global Markets LLC Enron Liquids Fuels, Inc. Enron Fuels Caribbean L.P. Enron Petrochemicals Company Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. Enron Clean Fuels Company Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Pte Ltd Enron Capital & Trade Global Resources Corp. Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. - Singapore Branch  Thanks! 
 Taria,  Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it! 
  I was out for a Dr's appt Oct. 23rd for 2 hours and Oct 19 4 hours. 
 This will get you access to Livelink 
 Any update on these faxes?  I have to get my list to Louise Kitchen today. 
  Here's set of any master agreements I need ASAP.  I didn't mention it on the earlier ones, but for all of these, if any of the agreements have been amended, I will need any amendments, as well as any guarantees.  Much thanks! 
 No, only executed amendments. 
   Sharon,  BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.  THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE! 
  Please handle.   Much thanks. 
 Yes, everything. 
  Sharon, did one of the Canadian lawyers look at the list for the things you could not identify? 
 Barbara Gray has asked me to seek your advice concerning our Enron Net Work client's request that we send a Confidentiality Agreement to an Enron Net Works customer located in Australia.  Among the issues we are concerned with are whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Australian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable or would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  When you have a minute we would be most appreciative of your input.  I have attached the form of Confidentiality Agreement we propose to submit to our customer. 
 Lance,  Did we replace the fax machine we erroneously took on the 33rd floor? 
 Already done.  See you tonight! 
 I saw you across the dining room at Luther's but you left before I got a chance to wish you a Happy New Year's.  I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week.  I'll have to take your class and you can explain to me how you went from lawyer to weathercaster.  Happy New Years again, and let's hope this year is better than the last! 
 Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.  The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.  Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.  I am proud to be an American...! 
  Anne, Mark Greenberg will not be in the office for the next two days.  Will you have time to look at this?  Thanks! 
 John wanted legal advice today, so I passed this email on to Anne Koehler for handling. 
  Larry,  Can you send me the aricles and bylaws for another company, Enron Transportation Services.  Much thanks, for ALL your help! 
 You are the best! 
 It sounds ok to me. 
 Sheri,  This project is very important to me.  However, I am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all.  I expect I am really the only one who will be giving you sustantive input.  As well, I have other design modifications we will need to incorporate.  I just wanted to give you a head's up because you are going to get ahead of me here for awhile. 
 Can you take a look at all the Canadian Agreements listed on this list provided to us by BP and verify whether these agreements exist in Canada? 
 You (as usual) are the best! 
 Mary Cook wanted me to send you an email to make sure if you are sending the Master Netting Agreement out to counterparties that you delete the last page of the agreement, which contains the user notes. 
  Teresa,  By copy of this email, I am asking Stephanie Panus, another Paralegal in our group, to handle this for you as I am on working on a special project this week.  Stephanie, per Teresa's voicemail, Cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us ASAP.  Can you please give their attorney a call.  Teresa, you forgot Mr. Gollomp's phone number. 
 At the request of Jennifer Smith, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  Thanks Sam, you're the best! 
 Bob Shults is Asking about that amendment to the Amerex Fee Agreement.  Can you help him... 
  I would like to attend.  God knows if Harry can/will come.  We'll see.  I did 12 (slow) miles last weekend... 
 Running 12 miles was no problem.  Harry & I had a little "tiff" (I hope only) this weekend, and as usual, he's out of town, so we haven't been able to talk.  So who knows? 
 I think yes. 
 Anne also requested this.  Kay young prepared and is emailing a copy to anne. 
 Per my conversations with Brandon, I am enclosing a clean and blacklined draft of the NDA revised to reflect changes in connection with your prior confidential discussions with the counterparty.  This form should be transmitted to the counterparty. 
 Steve asked me to send an email asking if you haven't already begun drafting your agreements yet, when you name you agreement, please indentify them by the counterparty and the products such as "Koch Energy-Gas" or "Aquila Marketing-Financing".  Thanks. 
  Yes they are to prepare all the UCC filings. 
  My pleasure.  Reading all that should keep you busy for awhile! 
  I don't know the answer to this.  Do you? 
 I am still using the list.  I have to circulate the list to the team from time to time. 
 Done. 
 Any idea who knows the answer to this question? 
  Can you please handle.  Thanks. 
 I wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as Mark approves the changes.  Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging. 
 Name of Company:  ERMT LLC, a Delaware limited liability company  Address:  1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas  77002 
 Branches:  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.  Restrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF. 
  Has this ever come in?  Can someone please respond to Jennifer?  Thanks! 
  Can you please handle this for Chris.  Thanks. 
 Sam,  Thanks for taking care of this! 
 So far I'm on if I don't have to work.  Harry and I broke up on Monday. 
 Done. 
 I need to know what group Nekesha is in. 
 You do not have to grant Nakesha access.  She already has view only access as does any Enron employee.  If you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database, she should be able to get view access to the database.  All Enron employees have view access.  Only employees of Legal and Credit can have edit access access.  Does that help? 
 We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.  ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.  We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.  I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.  Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.  Much thanks! 
 Edmund Cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people, credit people, companies, or change other drop downs in the database.  I have key word access on this side of the Atlantic and Edmund has it there.  If you need London Credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have Edmund go add them, or the company as a new key word. 
  I am not aware of any changes, are you? 
  Do I need to help you getting this out? 
  Who was this passed on to for handling? 
 I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that! 
 I'll give him a call. 
  Nothing to report. 
 Nothing from Legal. 
 I faxed you the alcoa ISDA immediately after we spoke.  It should be in NY right now. 
 Mark and I were just discussing the project yesterday.  I am out for Thanksgiving vacation all next week, but when I get back the week after that we definitely want to get it back on track! 
 Sure thing! 
 Do you have a full legal name for Equiva Trading? 
  Any conflicts? 
 Attached please find the NDA you requested. 
 Attached please find a current list of the Networks, EnronOnline and CommodityLogic executed and draft Confidentiality Agreements for your review. 
 Attached please find the referenced lists for your review. 
 Sheri,  I won't be back until that Thursday after Thanksgiving.  You might want to re-schedule that meeting. 
 I spoke to Norma at your store yesterday, and she said to send you an email to reserve a table.  I am with the Enron Legal Dept. and we would like to reserve a table for happy hour on Friday at 6:00 pm for 10 people.  We would like to have both wine and h'ors d'oeuvres.  If you need additional information, or if there are any problems, please call me at 713/853-3399. 
  Any conflicts? 
 With today being Leslie's day off, do you have any problems with these counterparties extending their tenor to 51 months?  This is a rush so I need to get them approved tonight. 
  OK for Legal. 
  You are the woman! 
 At the request of Albane Perinne, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  We have two additional NDA's in addition to the Live Capital one.  Any conflicts? 
 I'll approve this on today's approvals 
 Per my conversations earlier this week with Stephanie Sever and Wendi LeBrocq, I have sent down the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement and the three Password Applications necessary get the following three entities set up to start trading on EnronOnline.  Per my conversation with Stephanie and Wendi, the counterparty would like the counterparty to start trading on EOL by tomorrow.  The three entities are:  1.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agent for and on behalf of Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE) 2.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Ameren Generating Company 3.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS)  What if anything do we need to to to ensure that they can start trading by tomorrow.  The counterparty is calling me daily checking on this?  Can you please let me know? 
 As you requested, I am enclosing a revised Mutual form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  As I stated in my earlier email, if you have any comments or questions, please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-3448. 
 Janet,  Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you. 
 I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank. 
  No, I don't need one, but thanks for hunting that down! 
  No executed NDA received. 
 Who is Kevin Meredith?  I only review counterparty lists I receive from Credit. 
 It only shows a draft sent, no executed contract. 
 Per my note below, please fax the agreement to me at the fax number below, and I will have it executed by an officer at Enron and return it to you via fax.  If you would prefer to have originals executed, please send two executed originals to me, Tana Jones at 1400 Smith Street, 38th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002.  I look forward to receiving the document. 
 Your comments with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement have been forwarded on to me by Brandon Wax.  After reviewing them, we have agreed to most of your comments.  We have agreed to delete the arbitration provision but have retained the limitation of damages. Further, it is Enron corporate policy that the confidential information shall be limited to a term two years so we are unable to delete the final paragraph.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel at (713) 345-8897 or email us and let us know if these changes meet with your approval. 
  Sheila Tweed, the lawyer for this turbine product, has approved all of the counterparties on the attached list to trade this product, EXCEPT The City of Tacoma, Dept. of Public Utilities.  Let me know if you need anything further from me. 
  As you requested... 
  NDA for CheMatch, any conflicts? 
  I think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at Merita we negotiated the ISDA with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is OK to release the ISDA to you.  The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258. 
 Just a note...  I have not gotten that ISDA Master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the Atlantic.  I have asked Jay Williams in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.  I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit.  Just wanted to keep you updated... 
 At the request of Brandon Wax, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
  OK for me. 
  Tom,  With respect to this NDA, do you want us to send it directly to Deloitte, or do you want to send it to them?  If you would like us to send it to them I am going to need an email address...  Let me know what you prefer... 
 No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then. 
  You should now have access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database. 
 Today. 
 As you requested: 
 Ran it by Leslie, OK for us! 
 Russell,  I want you to be my friend forever, after all, you are my favorite, ex-Credit person! 
 Thanks for the kind word! 
 At the request of Anne Koehler, I am transmitting the final draft of the referenced Guaranty. 
  I am sorry, but I checked with the lawyer, and we are going to need that executed Agreement and we are going to need it as fast as you can track it down...sorry to keep being such a pest! 
  Any conflicts? 
 As you requested, attached is the form of NDA for transmittal to your customer: 
 Anytime! 
  No time off. 
 I'll take care of this... 
 Janet,  Would you like me to fax it to you?  If so, what is your fax no? 
 I just spoke to Stacey Richardson, and, with Georgi Landau gone, she said we should contact her, or Bridgette Anderson, with any Global Contracts questions for the time being. 
 Janet,  I also thought it would save you alot of time if you are going to draft a document if you had the word version, so I am attaching it. 
 I am going away to the beach today so I am going to leave a little early today, at 2:00 pm. 
 We deserve it! 
 I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.  I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.  So, I am waiting on Credit... 
  ALL of the swap form are now back in the attorney forms bank! 
 I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks! 
  Any conflicts? 
 Anne Koehler & I had a quick call w/Doug Glass.  Thanks for his name.  We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).  And NY law.  Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.  I also heard back from Justy.  Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it! 
 Received email! 
 I'll be leaving for New Orleans in about 30 minutes for our legal conference.  It was fun visiting with you too.  I miss you terribly. 
 In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.  In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT Canada.  I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. Prior Guarantees. 
 FYI, cpy below is governmental. 
 I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with both of you.  She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.  I miss you! 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:   ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border)  Effective Date:  March 31, 2000  Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:  Kellogg Company  Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: Weather and foreign exchange 
 Per my conversation with Lisa, I am going to open the referenced counterparty to trade financial. 
 I will be out Monday morning for my home inspection.  Also, I have my Scenic Texas board meeting at 2:00 pm in Dallas on Friday, so depending when I can get  plane reservations, I will be out some or all of Friday. 
 We have received the executed Acknowledgement and Termination Agreement dated effective as of December 1, 1999 by and among El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company (formerly known as El Paso Marketing Company, also formerly known as Eastex Hydrocarbons, Inc.), El Paso Merchant Energy Gas, L.P., El Paso Energy Corporation,  and ENA (formerly known as ECT).  Such document referenced the merger of Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. with and into El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas L.P., and the subsequent assignment of El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas LP's rights, duties and obligations to El Paso  Merchant Energy-Gas Company.  Under such agreement, the parties agree that:  1.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that (a) the Sonat Marketing Company and Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. financial Transactions shall be governed by the El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company financial Master Agreement dated as of April 20, 1995; and (b) the Sonat physical transactions shall be governed by the El Paso Enfolie Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated March 1, 1998; 2. El Paso Energy Corporation, as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above; 3.  Enron Corp., as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above; 4.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that the Sonat financial Master Agreement dated as of September 1, 1994, and the Sonat Master Firm Purchase/Sale physical Master Agreement, will be terminated; 5.  Each of ENA, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and El Paso Energy Corporation agree that the Sonat physical Guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Sonat financial Guaranty guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Enron Corp. financial Guaranty dated as of August 28, 1995 and the Enron Physical Guaranty dated May 1, 1994 are thereby terminated.  All of the above is rather complex, and I've tried to reduce 3 pages of "Whereas" clauses into 1 paragraph, but I will distribute the document to the usual suspects, so any confusion about parties should become clearer. 
 On the attached list please note that per my email of 04/17/00, U.S. Gas Transportation, Inc. has been acquired by Aquila.  Future trading for this counterparty should be done out of the name USGT/Aquila LP. 
 Any update yet? 
 No, a transaction had been entered into, the Master Agreement to govern it was signed, getting the certificates was one of the requirements under the agreement. 
 Jan, that was good, thanks for sharing it! 
 Mark asked if you could work on the following with our new secondee, Jason. I provided Jason a hard copy yesterday since he didn't have a computer yet. Thanks! 
 I've been a little distracted.  I've had a contract on a new house, and we had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving forward for a May 5 closing.  Also, I have had short in an electric line that keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!  Dalzenia has been in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can replant my garden...it's always something.  Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.  How do I go about doing that? 
 My closing is set for June 5, move-in date for my new house is June 9, so there should be no problem. 
 We have a new lawyer that started in our group yesterday.  His name is Jason Peters.  Can you get him added to the Master Swap Agreement database ASAP. Thanks.  How goes moving the Portland masters? 
 I am available Saturday after my morning run.  If you would like some help I would be happy to help out! 
 Can we get some credit?  Much thanks! 
 I needed to whine with you yesterday about my favorite nat gas trader and couldn't get hold of you...and then my favorite lazy paralegal already passed on some of her work to me! 
 Can you give view access only to Marie Heard, Robbi Rossi, and Cynthia Harkness with Bandwidth Legal to the referenced database.   Thanks! 
 Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty.  Please remember to fax the counterparty U.S. IRS Tax Forms  1001 and Form W-8.  Thanks. 
 It  appears the online people have revised the initial counterparty list. 
 FYI  Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at Cadwalader to determine if using the word "exchange" in a corporation's name would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.  Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word "exchange" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in using "exchange" in your corporate name, however, putting "exchange" in a company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.  He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea. 
 I guess you mean Wendi, no Molly? 
 I forget when you are coming?  If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in the Asia/Pacific Group will be having his XVIII Annual La Dolce Vita Party which is always a great blast, and I'll secure you an invite too...let me know...! 
 This time I just pulled out the notebook with the drafts of confidentiality agreements you left one of them to do, and they didn't bother to file them in the binder, they just stuck them in so when I pulled the file out, the documents fell out. 
 The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out, Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it. 
 Mr. Uretsky,  At the request of Michael Danielson, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  If the agreement meets with your approval, could you please have it executed by an authorized officer of Viant Corporation and fax it to me for signature by Enron North America Corp.   If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call me.  My phone no. is (713) 853-3399 and my fax no. is (713) 646-3490.  Thanks for your help. 
 Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.  All of our forms are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out soon. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated April 10, 2000, effective  as of November 25, 1997, wherein Tembec Inc. assigned its interest in Contract No. #J7774.1 dated March 23, 1998 to National Bank of Canada.  Copies will be distributed. 
 We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of April 10, 2000.  This amendment revises the ISDA Master Agreement with the referenced counterparty to bring the agreement up to current form standards with changes including, but not limited to:  1.  Adding the Canadian Securities Acts representation; 2.  Making certain changes to elections with respect to Payments on Early Termination and amending the Setoff language; 2.  Makes changes to certain credit provisions, including letter of credit provisions, the form of letter of credit, the Independent Amount,, and amends the definition of "Material Adverse Change" .  Copies will be distributed. 
 On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a determination...but you know that...! 
 I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!  Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here early enough to do that either...  Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.  Don't be shy about calling me if you need any help with anything!  I mean it! 
 All's I have to say is I was here this morning before 7:00 am, and I was the only person here until 8:00 am (if you catch my drift)... 
 Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.  If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's ready to leave... 
 Yes to both questions... 
 I hope we are confirming trades under the new TXU ISDA Master...?! 
 Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was over there.  Thanks! 
 I have forwarded the Statoil/J.Aron trades down to Bob Klein and Jeff Sorenson to sign off on the actual deals listed.  I'll keep you posted... 
 Would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since I am going to have to send it up to Canada for signature.  Much thanks! 
 We have received the faxed executed Confidentiality Agreement dated April 18, 2000 with Fieldston Publications.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 I'm not Tim.  Perhaps you'd better contact him some other way. 
 I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.  The only thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated out.  What's happening with that? 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.  The copy will be forwarded to Dave Samuels.  It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.  If there is some otherr person than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know. 
 Attached is our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty.     cc:  Carol St. Clair, Assistant General Counsel 
 There is a document called "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" in Marie's directory where we all input any CA we have sent.  For some reason since last week it has appeared as a "read only" document", so I cannot input the agreements I am working on right now.  Can you get that fixed.  Thanks! 
 Can you email over to me your Paragraph 11 too!  Thanks again. 
 Attached is our form of Confidentiality Agreement which we would prefer to use.  If after reviewing our agreement you still prefer to use your own form, Carol St. Clair, an attorney in our group will have to get back to you with our comments.   I will wait to hear from you. 
 Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!  I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth counterparties:  1.  Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 28, 2000.  It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global Contracts.  2.  The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC should be used here.  If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get someone who can! 
 You are the one!  I hope everything works out, keep me posted and let me know if there's anything I can do to help! 
 Faxed the signed document to me at (713) 646-3490.  My direct phone in case you have any questions is (713) 853-3399. 
 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.

 Frank, can you email us both a copy of the GTC that the counterparty is seeing on the system.  Thanks! 
 The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like me to fedex it to you? 
 It's always nice to chat with you too!  I'd love to go to lunch, I'm going to put in on my calendar to call you when I get back so we don't forget until the next time we see each other. 
 Lorna,  Thanks for following up on this! 
 Getchen is in our personnel dept.  She will coordinate filling job positions with candidates.  If you just emailed her your resume, you might want to give her a few days because she is working on lots of jobs.  I've used her before, so you might want to mention my name, say I work in the Enron North America Legal Dept.  She is really sweet. 
 Taffy,  Can you take care of faxing him a copy of the ISDA and guarantees ASAP. Thanks! 
 Attached is the form of Letter of Credit you requested.  Also, I am still working to get that info from London on the margin funds and securities.  They are working on it so I hope to get it to you soon.  They are the only holdout. 
 Just to give a head's up,  In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of EnronOnline. 
 Let's chat about attached...! 
 I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades. Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with me on this? 
 I printed out the referenced list that you sent me, but it has some information on it that I don't think we necessarily want to show the NYMEX. Specifically, your last two columns that show "cmbTaxType" and "tg/Active". Is there any way you can reprint the list only showing the name of the corporation and the place of incorporation?  Thanks. 
 It wasn't at the bottom of my list, but it appears it was at the bottom of London's list. 
 Per your request a few weeks ago, Global Contracts prepared a list of executed financial masters for Bob Bowen which he forwarded up to me.  Let me know what you think. 
 Attached is the form of Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if I can be of further service. 
 As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global Contract and the online crew.  Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality agreement with Human Code, Inc. dated May 3, 2000.  Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults. 
 The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened. Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to my select, special friends! 
 Well, I was here by 7:30 this am and guess who's still not here yet?!  Think harder, I know you can get this one...! 
 Anthony,  You never got back to me on whether this date was good and the total head count.  Can youu please confirm this.  Thanks. 
 We have received the Confidentiality Agreement with Novo MediaGroup, Inc. dated  May 2, 2000.  Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults.  I am also attaching an updated list of the EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreements. 
 Ding, ding, ding...!  You're ready for Who Wants to be a Millionaire! 
 I have created a new subdirectory aptly called "Confidentiality Agreements" and have moved Marie's list of Confidentiality Agreements there, the list of EnronOnline Confidentiality Agreement and the two EnronOnline forms of Confidentiality Agreements. 
 What is going on with the revisions to the tax language in the ISDA?  I spoke to Marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of "ISDAexh.doc "was sent to Rhett Jackson for review and as far as she know it hadn't been signed off on.  Obviously, we still have the old language in the form and we need to get this updated. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with MarchFIRST dated April 27, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 In my directory. 
 You don't appear to have attached the list...    "Anita Herrera" <aherrera@statoilenergy.com> 05/04/2000 12:33 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated May 2, 2000 with the referenced counterparty.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 I'm ok.  Can you put it on my calendar.  Thanks. 
 Here's an updated confirm on Saga.  Bernice is awaiting your approval. 
 1.  5/2/00 List:  Per my conv. w/ CIBC World Markets, they are a U.K. incorporated company, and will be trading only out of New York  2.  5/3/00 List:  We are not changing our prior approvals, which included "no power" , which Leslie Hansen has reconfirmed. 
 Nancy,  Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one you are making.  The directions to my house are as follows:  1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is "Ashby", make a right on Ashby. 4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the back yard.  My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look forward to seeing you there! 
 We definitely have enough people for a party.  I haven't heard back from some people yet, I'll keep trying.  I hope to have some responses when I get home from work tonight.  Atached is of list of the status so far:    What do you think? 
 Andrea,  The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your choice!  - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 Great choice, I got several responses last night and that was not one of them!  All the recipes look really good (as usual). 
 Suzanne,  Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.  Can you coordinate with him the exact head count as we get closer.  Thanks! 
 I got several responses last night and this morning by email, so I am attaching a revised list. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World Markets plc.  Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed 
 I've got the dinner schedules for 7:30 pm.  Your choice was perfect.  There was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook.  I couldn't have planned it better! 
 Jeff Hodge is your man! 
 There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.  I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.  I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full time to this project finally.  So that's my story, how are you? 
 Attached are the recipes.  I sent you them all because they all looked so good.  Will you be talking to Steve?  I left him a voicemail about the dinner.  I have scheduled him for the garlic bread.  I guess I will just mail him the recipe.  - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 Attached are the recipes for the Church Gourmet Dinner.  I've got you down tor the pork chops (Alicia says  to make it a mix of pork and chicken).  All the recipes looked really good, so I thought you might want to look at them anyway.  The directions to my house are as follows:  1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is "Ashby", make a right on Ashby. 4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the back yard.  My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look forward to seeing you there!   - Black Bean Dip.doc - RoastRdPepperDip.doc - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc - ShrimpGazpacho.doc - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc - ScallopedPotatoes.doc - DeathbyChocolate.doc 
 I left a message for Judy Wells and will keep you posted.  Hopefully by the end of the weekend I should have an exact head count so I can tell people how much to make.  So far we've got 12.  The only recipe so far that is unclaimed is the Roasted Red Pepper Dip, you could either do that, or based on the number of people, you may do another of the meat recipe, since probably that will be the most expensive.  Why don't we chat (via email!) Monday and figure out the best way to go.  I've got a call into Peter Shaddock to see if I can borrow his barbecue grill and if he can get it to my house.  Another thing too, does the Church have folding tables and chairs to borrow? My table will only sit 6 at the best. 
 I can go either way on this.  I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not enough tables.  But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.  I used to have a nice folding table but it was stolen out of my garage.  If you host it I would be happy to help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...! 
 At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex A for the referenced counterparty.  Please call me at x33399 or Sara at x35620 if we can be of further assistance. 
 Do you have a fax no?  I could fax them to you... 
 Are we in agreement that you will be hosting the dinner.  If so, I will need to call everyone and let them know the change of plans.  In furtherance of that, I will need direction to your house to provide them. 
 Lisa,  I was returning your phone call to Carol St. Clair about the agreement and deleted the message by mistake before I got to your phone no.  Can you give me a call at (713) 853-3399.  Thanks! 
 I'll wait to hear from you tommorow.  "Lisa Taylor" <ltaylor@Cysive.com> 05/08/2000 02:39 PM 
 Bob McInosh from Rock-Tenn called yesterday, and they did a trade with us and owe us money and he doesn't know where to send it.  His phone no. is (770) 263-4456, fax. (770) 248-4402.  If someone could contact him with our wire transfer instructions.  It will probably be in the confirm you send him. 
 At the request of Anita Herrera, I am enclosing a copy of a list that shows the discrepancies that our records show from the list we were sent of trades to be assigned to J. Aron.  Please resolve the trades issues directly with Bob Bowen.  His # is 713/853-7859. 
 At the request of Anita Herrera, I am sending you a list of discrepancies with the J. Aron trades.  I tried to send this earlier and attached the wrong documents.  Please disregard that email and delete it.  Thanks. 
 Can you take care of sending him the executed documents! 
 Can you help me figure out the Portland thing so we can get this database opened...thanks! 
 Attached is our bilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement when both parties are providing Confidential Information. 
 I don't think you can bird dog her too much.  She receives in the emails and forwards them on to the relevant job group.  The person with the job then decides who they do or do not want to interview.  I don't think Gretchen will have much to do with that. 
 If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database from "Executed" to "Executed-Under Amendment".  Once a master is executed, "Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you should ever choose.  If you change it to "Draft Sent", "Under Negotiation", etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters. 
 How many times do we have to say this?! 
 Are we having your group meeting today?  Inquiring minds want to know... 
 Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement. We have not consented to the Statoil/J. Aron assignment (in principal yet, in actuality, no).  We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.  Only then can we move the trades...    Tanya Rohauer 05/09/2000 01:36 PM 
 The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 (last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the middle or toward the end of May.    Trey Hardy 05/09/2000 01:43 PM

 There has been a change in plans, the dinner is now going to be held at Pastor Beth's.  A list of who is coming, what they are preparing and directions to Pastor Beth's house are attached.  Laura, is Steve getting the recipe from you or Pastor Beth?  Pastor Beth, I've got you coordinating with Matthias & Karen.  I've faxed the recipes to Karl & Ulf.  July Weller is the only one I need to assign a recipe.  I'm hoping she'll do one of the Gazpacho recipes since it's a little more complicated.  Everyone else I having doing double recipes. I'll keep you posted... 
 I just forwarded directions to Pastor Beth's and a note about the number of people.  Did you get it?  We just got Windows 2000 and I'm having trouble with my emails...    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/09/2000 02:35 PM 
 I have opened the referenced counterparty to trade weather online.  However, they should continue to use the same special form of confirm that they are using offline until we get an ISDA Master in place with them. 
 We cannot move the trades until we agree to the assignment, which we have not done yet.  We are resolving the trades being assigned, so don't move the trades until you hear from me.  Bob Bowen has been working on this on the confirm desk side. 
 Yes, we will be having it at Pastor Beth's.  Do you need directions?  It's at 7:00 pm.    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/09/2000 03:55 PM 
 We will have 14 people.    "Preisinger, Andrea" <PREISINGER@tmh.tmc.edu> 05/10/2000 08:03 AM 
 I didn't havw any time off. 
 Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement you requested. 
 At your request, attached is the bilateral Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced counterparty. 
 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  If you have any questions or comments concerning the agreement please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Taylor, Assisant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7459.  If the agreement meets with your approval, please have it executed by an authorized officer and return it to me via fax at (713) 646-3490. 
 This Koch trade you sent me is a London based Credit counterparty, not a Houston counterparty so I have no information on it.  You are going to have to resolve this with London Legal, Edmund Cooper  who is an attorney in London at  011 44 20 7783 5382. 
 Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.  I need to respond to EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.  The list is broken up into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).  You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to trade is the Singapore based group of products. 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  With respect to the list for 5/8/00, Imperial Oil Resources and Pengrowth Corporation were on the initial approval lists.  We have a duplicate Global Counterparty # open for Imperial.  The second one needs to be shut down. 
 Attached is the form of ETA Amendment we executed with Koch Energy Trading. The referenced Diamond Shamrock/Koch joint venture would like to execute the same one.  Is this OK with you.    Forever in your debt...Tana 
 Melissa,  I still need to return the prior PG&E guarantees referenced below to the counterparty.  Were you having them pulled? 
 1.  Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty. Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron guarantees out with the counterparty?  2.  Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty? 
 Attached for signature is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need two executed copies since both parties have to execute the Guaranty.  This ISDA Master Agreement will supersede and replace an existing Master Agreement with this Counterparty, and this Enron Corp.Guaranty will supersede and replace the previous Enron Corp. Guaranty dated as of March 4, 1994.  In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of Incumbency.  Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 
 It looks like you finally made the cut again! 
 I have lots of blanks on my approvals on the attached list for several European products.  If you know any of the answers, can you please just hand write them in and fax them back to me, or email a more recent list you might that addresses the European approvals.  Much thanks. 
 She didn't return my phone calls from yesterday either, so if you can go ahead and double the batch, just making one batch w/o the shrimp for our vegetarian and non-fish eaters.  Thanks for your help! 
 I am still trying to get the countries of incorp. on the Japan List for you. Tom Moran is out today so I have to get them from Tracy Ngo. 
 What do the numbers "4" and "8" mean on your list?     Edmund Cooper 05/12/2000 04:14 AM 
 I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to have to email people the link to get in. 
 Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to people outside of Legal and Credit.  You will be able to use this database to verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues.  Jeff, once we  have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is still in progress).  Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to have view access to this database.  I will have to email them the link. 
 Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one sitting!  My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit. I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis fountain.  He's just lovely!  Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of the 4th of July holiday.  You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about things I can picture what you're talking about.  Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of poor Willow.  Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think I gave it justice.  It was good talking to you the other day!  I'll give you a call when I get back. 
 You're a star!    Stacy E Dickson 05/12/2000 01:59 PM 
 Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.  I ran them by Mark Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.  If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no. is (713) 853-7459.  I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in touch with me my phone no. is (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I understand either of you gentlemen can advise me on what legal issues, if any, we might have with trading the new Singapore online products with my US based counterparty list..?  Do we have any issues trading those products with counterparties incorporated in any specific country? 
 Attached please find referenced list.  A few notes:  No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese counterparties.  Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth. 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 11, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of= =20 the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under = an=20 ISDA Master Agreement.

 We have received the following two executed Confidentiality Agreements:  1.  Dow Jones & Company, Inc. dated May 11, 2000  2.  Cysive, Inc. dated May 12, 2000  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels.  I am also attaching a revised copy of the Online Confidentiality Agreement List.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions on the list. 
 I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).  We won't get the letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.  I spoke to Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.  I'll pass on the approval letter and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter. 
 No wonder you couldn't find it!  Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can see it, the job will be open outside Enron.  Didn't you think the job sounded perfect!    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 05/16/2000 10:50 AM

 I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to physical trading and the online account.  I also called the company and got a copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment. 
 can you give these three people in London Legal access to the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Thanks. 
 At the request of Rahil Jafry, attached is our form of bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.   Please let me know if the attached meets with your approval. 
 Attached is the list referenced above, revised to approve Imperial Oil Resources (cpy ID 58981) for all products but power (of course no credit derivatives).  The other Imperial Oil Resources Limited  from the original approvals (cpy ID5193), I would like shut down for all products until I am provided information as to how it differs from the other Imperial Oil Resources.  Whew...!!! 
 The check is in the mail...no really...!!!  Actually, I meant to give it to you at breakfast last weekend, but I have no memory.  Do you want to run Saturday again.  Do the Rose Garden run?    MONTALBANO.HOLLY@heb.com 05/09/2000 03:49 PM 
 How about this afternoon, right after lunch, before I start getting phone calls!    Greg Johnston 05/18/2000 11:23 AM 
 I have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to Melba Lozano on the Confirmation Desk for handling. 
 Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them. They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit. 
 I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions (brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading policy? 
 Attached please find the referenced lists. 
 Thanks for your help! =20 
 I spoke to Greg Johnston, one of the Canadian lawyers who is currently seconded here, and have determined the following:  Imperial Oil Resources is an Alberta limited partnership.  All Canadian transactions are entered into with this counterparty.  Imperial Oil Resources Limited is the General Partner of Imperial Oil Resources.  We do not transact business with this entity. 
 Thanks for the T-Shirt and the magic wand.  People have already been at my desk trying to steal my magic wand, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.  That was sweet of you to think of me! 
 Done... 
 The ballots are due in New York on June 20, and there are no provisions made for faxing the ballots, so we need to mail them in time to be received by the due date. 
 Per conv. w/Anthony, we should expect 13 people.  We do not need to teleconference anyone in.  Anthony wanted the London Global Contracts people on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact London Legal if they would like a presentation. 
 We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) effective as of 06/29/99.  Copies will be distributed.  IMPORTANT:  All confirmations for this counterparty must contain the following representation:  "Each party represents that it is in compliance with the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the board resolutions or other guidelines that are applicable to such party's execution and performance of this Transaction." 
 Sorry for my hold up on this list.  I had an issue with the division/dba approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.  We will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with divisions/dba's in the future.  For this Koch counterparty:  Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name gets amended to read as follows:  Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.  (FYI, this is the way we styled the ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.) 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 12, 2000.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Teresa Smith. 
 We have received Confidentiality Agreemend executed as of May 17, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 The list looks OK except take off Clement Abrams and Ted Murphy.    Suzanne Adams 05/22/2000 02:25 PM 
 Luanne Geison at J. Aron left me a message that their guaranty is being processed and she expect to have it ready early to mid week and will fedex it to us. 
 You can take them off.  I spoke to Sara and Marie didn't want them to attend and that is fine with Sara.    Suzanne Adams 05/23/2000 09:19 AM 
 With respect to El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., this counterparty was on yesterday's list as an amended counterparty, but it is actually a new counterparty.  It should be approved for all products but power. 
 Thanks Bob!     Bob Bowen 05/23/2000 02:09 PM 
 Melissa,  I still need to forward over the documents listed below.  Have you, or someone in your group, been able to track them down. 
 Per my conversation a minute ago with Leslie Hansen, El Paso Merchant Energy is OK to trade power, so I have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that change. 
 I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!  We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood Services.  I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before. We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft master to about a year ago.  Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial with us?  Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?  By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?  You Credit guys live high on the hog!  You must have a bigger budget than us! 
 At the request of Mike Danielson, I am attaching our form of NDA.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 (fax no 713/646-3490) or Mike at (713) 853-9052.  We look forward to hearing from you. 
 I'm not exactly sure what your email is getting at.  No matter what the financial product is, if we have a financial master agreement in place we should tie the financial master to the product.    Karen Lambert 05/24/2000 04:17 PM

 At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement.  It is our desire to have this agreement executed before the Tuesday, May 30 meeting with Louise and Mark Crosno.  If you have any comments or questions please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Taylor, V.P. and Assistant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7549.  Sincerely,  Tana L. Jones Sr. Legal Specialist 
 Please ignore my last list and use this one!! 
 We have received the executed amendment to the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty dated May 16, 2000.  Copies will be distributed. 
 Mark Taylor, the attorney I work for, has agreed to the changes you made, so if you would like to process the agreement on your side and fax the signed copy to me I will have it executed by an authorized officer here.  Thanks for your prompt review and have a nice Memorial Day holiday!      Timothy Sturm <TSturm@Altra.com> 05/26/2000 03:23 PM 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated May 29, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 
 Here's that physical deal you were inquiring about.  Stacy is a physical lawyer and will be taking care of that assignment. 
 Where are you going?!     Lisa Gillette 05/30/2000 09:46 AM 
 Good luck with the next stage of your life.  It has been a pleasure working with you!    Tobin Carlson 05/30/2000 09:52 AM 
 Anthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, you've got to have them somewhere there.  Maybe they're with some old Margie Wright files.  But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there. 
 I would like to take the following time off:  Wednesday, May 31 - I need to leave at 3:00  My new house closing is on Monday June 5 at Partner's Title in the old Texas Commerce Bank Bldg.- they haven't set the time yet I will be taking two days off in June to move into my new house - June 12 & 13  My old house sale closes on Monday, June 19 - also at Partner's Title - they haven't set the time yet  Let me know if there are any problems... 
 So I guess I'll be hearing from you when you need Confidentiality Agreements.  So we'll still get to work together!     Lisa Gillette 05/30/2000 10:03 AM 
 Lorraine, Mike is wrong.  I never got the fax of the executed NDA.  May he could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!    Lorraine Becker 05/31/2000 06:43 AM 
 Can you get the new attorney in our group, Jason Peters access to both the Financial Trading Database and the Online Trading Database.  Please let us know when he has access.  Thanks. 
 Attached is the revised list of our Online Confidentiality Agreements. Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or changes. 
 Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.  It appears Aurora Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.  We have an ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.  Further, per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC. 
 I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Someone went into one of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it wasn't.  If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please consult with him.  Thanks 
 It's about 1 1/2 hour drive outside of the City.  I think if you wanted to ride you would only be able to do it weekends.  Are you still interested? 
 Edmund,  Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a master swap agreement executed.  With this email Global Counterparty can open the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo.    If we get the master in signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation  (like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending the email.  Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.  We used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.  Does this make sense?...  I am now going to look for one with special instructions...  Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed documents I send down to them.  Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a copy in the Global Contract file) 
 Mary Solmonson is a Senior Director with ENA.  Business purpose was to discuss online issues.    Taffy Milligan 06/01/2000 02:19 PM 
 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:  Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)  Effective Date:   08/14/94  Executed Date:   05/11/00  Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.  Counterparty:   J. Aron & Company  Transactions Covered:  All products, except pulp & paper   Please note the following:  1. This ISDA Master Agreement supersedes and replaces the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with the referenced Counterparty dated as of   03/09/93. 2. Incorporated is the ISDA Master Agreement is the consent to the assignment by Columbia Energy Services Corporation ("CES") to ENA of the financial transactions between CES and J. Aron & Company. 3. J. Aron & Company is the Calculation Agent and Confirming Agent under the ISDA Master Agreement.

 I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover (and clean from my construction work).  I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast and dinner included!  Such a deal!  I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.  I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them yet.  What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things going on? 
 We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the "Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit. Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access so I can email them the agent to open the database.  Much thanks! 
 Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.  Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I will forward it to them.  We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.   Link --> 
 This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.  Stacy Dickson will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears she has not yet. 
 You scared me...I went in to make sure I sent the list to everybody!! 
 How about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading? 
 I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them up they will have a cow!!  1.  When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.  They are insistent that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to in the master apply.  2.  All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, should roll up under the master.  As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.  I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!! 
 I am still waiting for responses on the 5/30/00 list.  I hope to have it to you shortly. 
 Thanks, as usual!!     Leslie Hansen 06/02/2000 11:33 AM 
 I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the approved swap forms there.  The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".  I hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.  Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc), industrial-canadian, etc..  I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.  I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.  If there is a form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.  This should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office.  To the U.K. and Singapore:  We are going through a form revision process here in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies of the changes to you for your review. 
 FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until I am given further instruction.  As with all the online documents I am getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.  We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.  The original is being sent to Dave. 
 We have received the executed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement dated 5/24/00 with the referenced party.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and Mike Danielson. 
 Just a reminder that I will be at my house closing Monday morning... 
 As you requested... 
 FYI, you've got several people on the referenced resolution that are no longer in your group.  You might want to take a look at it... 
 We have a new paralegal in our group, Samantha Boyd, she just started Monday.  Can you get her Master Swap Agreement access.  Thanks! 
 I am going to have to leave the Group Meeting a little early tomorrow.  The online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 10:30 am Tom Moran and I are going to give a presentation on online approval procedures. 
 Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:  We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all financial immediately. 
 I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial. Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until they get your email.  Thanks. 
 Samantha,  When you get in let's take a look and see if you can get into the Master Swap Agreement Database. 
 Kal,  Attached is your agreement.        Kal Shah 06/06/2000 03:54 PM 
 I have jury duty scheduled for June 23 at 8:00 am. 
 At Stephanie's request, I am approving the following three counterparties to transact Enron power SALES only prior to these counterparties coming out on tonight's Credit approval list (when we will do the full approvals):  The three new counterparties are:  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania Electric Company  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan Edison Company  GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central Power and Light Company  Call me if you have any questions... 
 It is always a pleasure working with the online team,  You all keep me busy but you are always kind and thankful, and believe me, those thanks are always appreciated!     Lisa Gillette 06/07/2000 04:08 PM 
 Correct!     David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 06/07/2000 07:48 PM 
 I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type of financial power transactions they can enter into:  1.  The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options 2.  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options 3.  Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy prices swap, put & call options.  Per my discussions with Tom, this counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power.  They have a really old form of agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial transactions.  I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an ISDA.  I am going to talk to Credit about this.  They will definitely not be able to trade financial power by Monday... 4.  PXRE Corporation - weather only 5.  Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only 6.  Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only 
 Michael is the person.  Keep me posted if you don't get access.  How are you?  How goes the weight training?  Don't be a stranger... 
 In my absence on Monday and Tuesday, can you forward the counterparty approval lists to Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, and she will forward them on to my distribution, so we can at least get people reviewing the lists while I am out.  Much thanks! 
 Boy, I'd like to know where I'm going to be for the next 2 days too!    Tom Moran 06/09/2000 09:19 AM 
 I look forward to it!  I was talking to Genia and I also heard how lovely your house looked...I can't wait to see yours too!    Leslie Hansen 06/09/2000 09:33 AM 
 On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open them up for power.  US emissions has been opened.      P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract. 
 Attached is the referenced Annex B.  Call me if I can be of further help. 
 Always my pleasure. ...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?!    John Suttle 06/09/2000 01:30 PM 
 I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend will achieve "favored Credit person" status.    John Suttle 06/09/2000 03:42 PM 
 Dan,  I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.  Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting it signed.  Her phone no. is 853-9188.  I understand you need it signed by Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.  As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).  If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399. 
 You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.  For you, it would have much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.  I would certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to compete with sweet Russell...    John Suttle 06/09/2000 04:04 PM 
 Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you couldn't get those types of files in England).  One of our assistants got a call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.  So if you do want the blue files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the Atlantic again.  We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no big deal. 
 I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  In my absence, Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, will forward the Counterparty Approval Lists to you once she receives them from Credit. Please return any responses you might have to me.  Thanks! 
 I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality agreements.  On a going forward basis can you please provide that information along with the other info you give me.  Thanks!  I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.  If you have a RUSH Confidentiality Agreement that can't wait until Wednesday, call Mark Taylor at x37459 and he will find someone else in our Group to prepare it.  Louise, don't worry about Continental.  Mark is working on getting it signed in my absence!

 Are you going to be sending me some credit? 
 I'm so depressed...I wanted to work on this for you...!!    William S Bradford 06/12/2000 03:25 PM 
 I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.  Now Erica has received back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).  Can you work out what supplies you want from us.  We are happy to order whatever you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what the supplies are worth.  Thanks. 
 I don't know what a terminations number is?!    Carol St Clair 06/12/2000 11:52 AM 
 Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and moved into my new house.  I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.  This yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.  Hopefully, some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house! 
 Here's the excuse we need to get me up there for the Stampede!  Isn't it coming up soon? 
 Yes, we do have a standard Enron guaranty form.  It is located in atty.fms/swaps/current forms/guaranty.doc (both the Enron & counterparty guarantees are in there). 
 We have not yet received the executed documents. 
 You can go back sending the counterparty lists only to me and Mark Taylor. Thanks! 
 Just a reminder that I will be taking Friday afternoon off to meet the cable tv guy, then, my closing on my old house is set for Monday at 3:30 pm. 
 How can a non-bank be a multibranch entity?  If I remember, we spent a hour with London over the phone discussing just this issue! 
 Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the approval.  We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always contain the most current resolution. 
 I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.  I mentioned to him our agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner, he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously, mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just changing it for any cross-border issues.  I told him I would run it by our Credit Dept. 
 We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX for 2000.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary Companies.  Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help with this! 
 We got a call from the NYMEX today, and they received another Access terminal that appears to be slated for Enron.  My understanding is that we have the five terminals that I ordered.  You do have your two in Portland, don't you?  Please confirm that for me.  Thanks! 
 We have received the executed Second Amendment to Guaranty Agreement dated as of June 9, 2000.  This amendment changed the guaranty of Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA ("Guarantor") with respect to the physical transactions with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. and financial transactions with Neumin Production Co. to an unlimited guaranty.  The original guaranty amendment will be sent to Credit. 
 Per my conv. a minute ago with Maryann Friel, they will be fedexing the documents out to us tonight! 
 You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they would like to send us one we will take a look at it.    David P Dupre 06/15/2000 10:40 AM 
 We have finally received the executed Termination Agreement for the two Koch physical trades done in error on EOL (which have already rolled off the books!).  The deal nos. are EOL Nos. 103992 and 104018.  I am sending the original to Bob Bowen. 
 We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assigned two physical trades to CIBC World Markets Plc.  Those two deal Nos are EOL deal no 137945 and 149472.  The originals will be sent to Bob Bowen. 
 To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:  1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty 2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since it is written more in our favor. 3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided. 4.  The address of the counterparty 5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty  Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.     Teresa Smith@ENRON 06/15/2000 10:59 AM 
 We had a new paralegal start in our group Monday.  Her name is Susan Bailey. Can you get her access to our Master Swap Agreement Database.  Thanks. 
 I just wanted to let you know that Shari Stack is working on that Talisman letter.  It was good talking to you, as always.  I hope you got out and "stomped" a little bit! 
 You're the best!    Teresa Smith@ENRON 06/15/2000 01:04 PM 
 The Power Desk directed me to give John Galperin, our broker with Salomon, Smith Barney a call to get the May Entergy volumes.  John spoke to the NYMEX and they came back with a figure of -0- contracts traded in May, with a total of 34 Entergy contracts traded so far for 2000 (all months). 
 I can be there, but I have to be home by 1:00, because the cable tv guy is going to show up sometime between 1-5.    Taffy Milligan 06/15/2000 02:31 PM 
 Tanya, "eligible" is spelled wrong...otherwise, lovely credit worksheet!    Carol St Clair 06/15/2000 03:19 PM 
 I will be able to attend. 
 I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North America and its trading affiliate offices.  This includes Houston, Calgary, London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.  Can someone with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this to.  Thanks! 
 If we are going to vote on the NYMEX demutualization plan the ballots are due tomorrow, so today is your last possible day to get them out, since it only provides for mail in ballots, no faxes this time.   I check and both Mark and Kevin are in, for right now! 
 Done. 
 I do not have an individual list.  It will have to got to all the employees in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is pretty much the list I had below.    Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON Sent by: Erika Vaughan@ENRON 06/19/2000 02:24 PM 
 I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have not received such approval.  With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.  Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with assigning the online account over... 
 Wouldn't you like to know which of the two Susan's gave her notice today!?! 
 I called Haedicke to check on the status of his Rappaport conversation, and he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax in the ballots, which I have done (I got Kevin's too). 
 I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too. 
 Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?    Greg Johnston 06/20/2000 02:41 PM 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the original list, I open them up for it just in case.  Also, I opened them up for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for financial.    , 
 I just wanted to check for one of our British attorneys who is coming into town next month to confirm he is registered for a seminar.  Do you have Mark Elliott registered for Derivatives I on August 8 and 9.  Can you confirm this for me so I can confirm it for him.  Thanks! 
 Please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below (I think Sydney is our Australia office).  I have revised the letter a little and am reattaching  it.  Thanks!       Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON Sent by: Erika Vaughan@ENRON 06/19/2000 02:58 PM 
 Mike, I thought you were taking care of this for me.  What happened?  P.S. Does Samantha Boyd has full access to the database also? 
 I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.  Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?  Anything else special you think I need to mention? 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between Continental Airlines, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and EnronOnline LLC dated June 19, 2000.  A copy will be distributed to Daniel Diamond and Dave Samuels. 
 Just a followup note:  We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!). 
 FYI,  I spoke to my contact in the NYMEX Marketing Group and she told me that the NYMEX demutualization vote passed 140-11. 
 The draft of the email you sent Mark looks OK in terms of its content.  Is there any way I will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails? 
 Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that might be responsible for filing original guarantees. 
 Your list looks good!    Enron Messaging Administration@ENRON Sent by: Erika Vaughan@ENRON 06/21/2000 10:34 AM

 Just wanted to give you a head's up.  We received last night from ED&F Man their form of proposed Clearing Agreement with the OMLX.  It appears they simultaneously sent it to the OMLX.  I am having my assistant fax a copy to you.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this morning.  As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few weeks ago, and they've now come back with their form.  I don't know how customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look at it here and give you a call. 
 I have to move some final things out of my old house.  I hope I close tomorrow!  If you would like to meet me at my new house, and then we could run over quick and grab the final things I could go after...    "Patti Young" <pyoung@pdq.net> 06/21/2000 07:08 PM

 She's not too far away from snapping...!  I'm afraid to say anything.    Marie Heard@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 06/21/2000 05:27 PM 
 Yes it does.  It includes any original guarantees we may be giving or receiving.     Jeffrey T Hodge 06/22/2000 02:52 AM 
 Just a reminder that I hope to be out this afternoon (as of this morning my old house closing is set for 3:00 pm, keep your fingers crossed it goes through this time!).   Also, I have morning jury duty tomorrow. 
 You are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision!    Jeffrey T Hodge 06/22/2000 09:03 AM 
 I have prepared a form of transmittal memo for sending the original guarantees down to Credit.  I though you might want to use it as a template. 
 The memo applies to ENA and its other trading affiliates, Enron Canada Corp= .=20 and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.).  If you work for= =20 any of these trading affiliates, this memo would apply to you.  Because of= =20 the constraints of our company wide broadcast system, they could not limit= =20 the email in some offices to only those companies, so we had to send it out= =20 to the whole office.  If you do not work for those companies, this does not= =20 apply to you. 
 Below is my listing of the remaining projects.  1.  Finish painting sunroom. 2.  Paint bedroom furniture. 3.  Replace two front door thresholds. 4.  Put mailbox in Nancy & Peter's front door.  They have the hardware. 5.  Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's. 6.  Paint outdoor pipes same color as house. 7.  I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.  Bob asked if you could replace it for him and send him the bill. 8.  Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom plumbing.  That should do it! 
 Marie,  Obviously, you are not "in the know".  The word on the Enron streets is that Yao is brokering the peace in Bosnia, and that is why he is too busy to call his old friends! 
 Good memo.  I look forward to hearing from you.    Ted Murphy 06/22/2000 04:20 PM 
 I am the person that handles all this.  If you would like to meet to discuss this let me know and we'll set up a time.    Steven J Ehrig@ENRON 06/22/2000 05:51 PM 
 What the NYMEX is trying to get at is their concern that the NYMEX consider= s=20 the trades of ENA and its two other principal trading affiliates (Enron=20 Canada and London) to be one and the same as ENA.

 Marie,  I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.  I thought, "could it be...might it be...?!".  And it was...it was truly he.  I'm sure of it! 
 With respect to Utilicorp, I cannot amend their profile yet to open them for financial until I get the word that everything is set up and ready to go.  We do have the financial master in, so as soon as we figure out how we want to open the accounts, I can send my email. 
 Let me know on MRT what you find out.  When can I see your house?    Leslie Hansen 06/23/2000 03:21 PM 
 I am still getting the chill and it's getting really old.  I've tried to enter into the conversations, make a comment or interact, and I just get frozen out.  It's going to be a long walk over there to help her out.  In  2 weeks, I'm all she's got. 
 Am I supposed to do anything here? 
 I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.  The top of the Schedule says "Milbank Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.  Robina Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.  I would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.  Mark needs the computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in Houston.  Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.  I'd appreciate it. 
 Stephanie rightly pointed out that I was confusing Utilcorp w/Pacific Gas and Electric.  Just call me Roseannaroseannatana!  Attached is the corrected list for 6/20/00 to open Utilicorp for all products except pulp & paper. 
 Enron's trading policy prohibits employees from trading any products the=20 company trades.  If you have any questions about any specific products plea= se=20 feel free to contact me or any of the London legal team.

 As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced online.  Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already given to the mirrored product.

Our floor is completely full right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to do some shifting.  They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of space.  Something y'all can relate to there in London!

 We have received the executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with Belco Oil & Gas Corp. dated as of July 8, 1999.  We have also received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein the trades under the existing Belco Operating Corp.

The two active Belco masters will be the Belco Oil & Gas Corp. master and the Belco Energy Corp. master.  Copies will be distributed.
