Hi :-)

The combination with the  EQ1 is not good, otherwise it would be a neat set (see my post from a while ago).

While someone in the Amazon (US) reviews managed to take some great images for such a telescope, I would not recommend imaging. With a webcam it might work, but with the weight of an additional camera (e.g. DSLR) the mount will be overstrained! It is as-is already. No counterweight or tube rings will change any of that.



I don't see the relation to tracking and deep-sky objects. Most of them are best observed with 2-3mm exit pupil, thus lower/medium magnification. The transit times through the field of view is slow. Higher magnification results in a darker image, thus it's more suitable for planets - and then the EQ1 will fail due to stability issues. 

You can compensate it a bit by balancing it ideally, putting weight onto the center plate, and not extending the tripod, but this almost negates OP's height requirement. 


M1 can even be seen in binoculars or finder-scopes. It's not very spectacular though unless using a larger aperture. [Here](http://www.perezmedia.net/beltofvenus/archives/000327.html) it is as seen in 6" (closest I could find to 4.5/5").

The Heritage will match the performance of the 4.5" and even outperform is solely because of the stability issue, and has a few benefits for deep-sky as well. 

The 130p with a box won't really be more bulky, but much more sturdy and at decent height while seated (camping chair).

I have the smaller 76mm table-top, and with OPs requirements it makes little sense. Even cheaper 7x50, 10x50 Binoculars or 15x70 on a tripod would be a better solution for deep-sky I'd think, and still be useful later on.

Hi, if you are in no hurry (shipping from china): http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html

Almost every module/sensor is some standard part, you'll find examples on the Arduino site or on Instructables.

Aliexpress is great if you are on a budget and you need components, breadboards, simple multimeters and such.

But you should be able to find everything locally from an electronic store, of course for a bit more. Even Amazon ha all sort of kits; Random example: http://www.amazon.fr/SunFounder-composants-%C3%A9lectronique-Mega2560-d%C3%A9butant/dp/B00D9M4BQU/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443704310&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=arduinoHello :-)

It depends on your budget, print size, and how much you enjoy the technical aspect. It's hard to give a recommendation without knowing more details.

E.g. for learning and on a budget, a Printrbot is great. The UP / UP Mini is pretty much as plug&amp;play as it gets, requires very little configuration while producing good prints, but it's also very limiting in regards of customization (not open hardware) and filament use. The Mini Fabrikator/tiny boy is one of the lowest cost models but has a very limited build area. A Reprap Prusa is one way to go if you want both performance and like the technical aspect of the hobby. For small figurines a SLA printer is neat, but the process and cost bare downsides.

Many hackerspaces / makerspaces and larger electronics store have 3D printers. Perhaps you can take a look at a few prior to purchasing anything.

When I started I had little 3D modeling experience, but it's really not too difficult to make some own models. There are plenty of free programs and tutorials available :-)Canon, HP, Epson, all made portable 2D printers :-) It was pretty common. I still have one that's around the size of a paper towel roll.

There's the Portabee 3D printer. You can see a few portable solutions on Thingiverse &amp; the Rerpap Wiki.

The Fabrikator mini is pretty small, but too bulky to really carry in a backpack all the time.I started with the PP3DP UP plus and even today I love it's ease of use, especially when it comes to all the settings.

After I bought a Printrbot I went through the "Slicer is nicer" tutorial and it all makes sense, but it's still not as easy to get a good reliable print with support material all the time. But I'm making small things with crazy overhangs and intersected structures. The automated support structure generation of Slicer and others has really gotten better, too.

With everything reprap based you can replace parts and electronics rather cheap, especially if you order at ebay, Aliexpress or so.Hello, I have a similar telescope, and if you don't mind the wait, you can get a 3.2mm or 4mm HR Planetary for under 40 dollars at Aliexpress (Chinese sellers).

Individual eyepieces are the way to go, as the sets typically contain Pl\u00f6ssl (short eye relief for the focal lengths under 10mm). 

The HR Planetary (clones) have 58 degree apparent field of view, so a tad more then the Pl\u00f6ssl. Also a 4mm Pl\u00f6ssl is pretty much unusable due to the very, very short eye relief. A 10-12mm Pl\u00f6ssl and a 2x or 3x Barlow can work, but it'll cost the same and the barlow will show achromatic aberations.

The mentioned "gold line" or Orion Expanse are also very good for their low price, at least if you buy the no-name kind (24-30 dollars at dhgate or Aliexpress, 48 dollars at Agena Astro if you want to buy from the US; Corvus optics had them too at a low price, but they are out of stock).

Personally, I use these the most:

Overview: 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl (22.50 at corvus, shipped) under dark skies, 20mm gold line under light polluted skies

Deep-SkY/Mid-range: 12mm Erfle (Seben; The 15mm gold line is also a cheap option)

"The moon eyepiece" 6mm Gold line

Planets: 3.2mm HR Planetary and a modified 6mm gold line to reach 3mm (if you like to tinker they can easily be modified)

There is a 2.5mm HR Planetary; I have it, I would not reccomend it. The 5"F/5 won't benefit from more magnification, everything gets a tad larger but noteworthy darker, above 150x magnification you don't gain any actual detail with these telescopes. Their affordable price and wide-field views are great though :-)Hi :-) Use what you have for now, Pl\u00f6ssl eyepiece sets are a bit of an overkill, but the longer focal lengths perform very well. Along with the Barlow you have everything covered. The wide-angle "gold lines" are a bit nicer, but don't worry. Save your money for later :-) If you get something like the Zhumell z8 in the future, it already includes a 2" wide angle eyepiece, and along with the Pl\u00f6ssl you'd be all set. A different eyepiece type may show a bit more field of view, and a dedicated short focal length eyepiece will be great for planets, if you ever want to upgrade that's probably where I'd start.

Congratulations on your Saturn observation :-) A 5" is a great light bucket, it really can do a lot under decent conditions. You should check out a few open star clusters as well (cr399, h&amp;chi persei, Plejads) and the Orion Nebula that'll soon be up again around the first half of the night (got up around 3-4am to observe it the other night :-) )

Clear skies!Laser drill submarine robot to Icy moon Europa. Look under the crust, now.Hello,

there's the AWB Onesky ($199, Heritage 130p in Europe) that's in your price segment and even leaves a bit to spare for "turn left at Orion" (the missing manual on how to observe, where to find objects, and what to expect) and an aditional eyepiece :-) The AWB has a few quirks ( https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but overall it's one of the better choices in this price range. 

There are a few cheaper ones such as the Orion skyscanner 4", Heritage 100" or starblast 4.5", but these reflectors are not suited well for high magnification and do not perform well in cheap eyepieces, the AWB has a few quirks too, but is a good alrounder. There's also the Celestron Powerseeker 114eq, but the mount is way too weak! You can get these used for under 50 bucks sometimes and build a simple rockerbox, then it's a steal. You can also get a 130/650 on eq2 for around your budget, but if you can deal with the lower height of the AWB, it's more rigid and more portable :-) The refractors in this price range either offer much less aperture or are on a weak mount... Or both. Then there's the Celestron c90, it's a nice spotting scope for day-time and a neat travel telescope, it's aperture has it's limits though.



Also check for used telescopes, you might get a 6" or 8" used within your budget.

There are a few significant differences between reflector, refractor, catadiopter, but it boils down to:

- A larger aperture shows more (see https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) - and while the visual impression never meets the colorful images, it's amazing to see these things with your very own eyes.

- The optics must be good (no bird-jones, which is a short newtonian reflector with a longer focal length then it's physical size, in this price range they should be avoided; Also short simple refractors will show a lot of chromatic aberation, lowering the contrast)

- A stable mount. This is more important then it may seem to beginners. At high magnifications every touch of the focuser will cause a weak mount to shake, making observing and focusing tedious.

Otherwise check the sticky over at /r/telescopes. You will also find some reccomendations (some outdated) and more info on telescope types.

I have the AWB and also larger telescopes. It is True that the 5" bucket has it's limits, but I end up using it more frequently then my larger dobsonian or equatorial mounted telescope, as I can easily carry it to a darker location (important for Nebula) or quickly put it on my balcony to take a look at the moon or planets before heading to bed.

The dobsonian design is simple, does not look much like the stereotypical telescope, but it's rigid, intuitive to use, fast to set up, and most money goes into the optics, not a mediocre eq mount that's barely capable of supporting the telescope (a common problem in entry level sets).

Do not buy the bird-jones newtonian telescopes in this price segment (shorter tube than their focal length, a lens tries to correct the flaws of a short focal length mirror, causing several issues, e.g. commonly 127/1000 or 114/1000...), avoid eyepiece kits (mediocre, overprived, redundant), zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view on one side of the setting) and weak mounts. And just buying too many accessories at one in general ;-)


Also ad some binoculars - even cheap ones like the celestron cometron 7x50 will be great tools in addition to your telescope, as it's easier to find things at the beginning (Andromeda Galaxy, M81/M82, Orion Nebula, plejads, star clusters in general), and they are great travel companions.

If you have a local astronomy group or stargazing event location nearby, go there! :-) You will see what's available, possible get a glimpse through different telescopes, and first-hand advice.


(Excuse my wall of text, lack of formating and more links to telescopes and images, I am currently on a train with my stoneage cellphone ;-) )There are a few exceptions, it's quite possible to enter the hobby with less money and still have fun. Also a barlow will ad chromatic aberation, there are some nice low budget eyepieces such as the Hr Plane or Gold-line that will perform much better than Kit eyepieces plus cheap achromatic barlow (and cost just a few bucks more) :-)

I am sure your 4" refractor on the CG4 is a great set and will beat telescopes such as the AWB Onesky or a 4.5"-5" reflector on an equatorial mount in many regards, but even with their flaws these sets make great beginner sets for those who can't (or don't want to) spend 400 dollars on a nice refractor or 8" dobsonian light bucket :-) Not too long ago 3" reflectors and 2.5" refractors where entry level telescopes, and now you get 4.5-5" for 100-200 dollars... It's great.Also, this :-)

Congratulations, have fun!Hi :-)

You should be capable of assembling a kit if you want to go in that direction, some are very well documented. But with your budget there are a lot of good ready-to-run printers. But it never hurts to know how they work, in case you do need to fix or improve something.

I rarely print large objects, but it's nice to be able to. It depends on the things you need to print of course. Also over, say, 6" you can also combine parts (glue or print a connection section).

Larger prints have more issues (Time, layer adhesion, warping when using ABS). Also dual or triple extruders are nice (you can print multiple colors or different materials, e.g. soluble support structures) but more of a hassle to calibrate right.

Personally I started with the UP and I can still recommend it. I had no clue about 3d printing and it made it very, very easy. But later I assembled multiple Reprap based printers and it just has more possibilities, but requires a lot more tinkering with settings and hardware until you got a consistent part quality. 

I still can not get the support structures nearly as reliable on the reprap based machines. Even an engineer was impressed with the UP despite designing his own Reprap-spin-off and using commercial big printers. But with the UP you get the best results with the OEM filament that costs a bit more (not that the cheapest filaments always work well in Repraps, never buy too cheap)  or you need to buy/build a temperature mod.

Somecallmekenny already explained the heated bed. I recommend it, ABS has some benefits. If you are constantly in the same room with the machine, consider using PLA though to avoid the fumes.

Do you have a local hackerspace or something? I am sure they would be happy to show you around, $1200 is a lot of money, so looking at a few machines never hurts :-)

There also is a old Make magazine comparing some printers, where the UP was the only one printing the beak of a test model correctly; But that particular test it's a bit dated (2013); I read it got good ratings three year in a row. Grab a recent Make 3d printing comparison and see for yourself, you might find an ideal printer. Keep in mind the authors are experienced though, so it's not always beginner machines they are reviewing.

Of course those aren't complete, many more models and options. Hello,

while there's indeed a large technical aspect to all of it, all that really matters is that you get out there and use the equipment :-)

Sorry for the long &amp; complicated reply, but there are just so many bad sets in this price range and things you have to watch out for, thus my attempt to give a few pointers.
It's hard to tell how much reading people have done prior to posting here, so if you need explanations for a specific term or topic, don't hessitate to ask :-)

Of course I could just write "get this or that", but I think it's best to at least get an idea of WHY to get a certain telescope before purchasing, as there's no universal solution. Some may prefer a light travel telescope (Always do an image/video search to get a sense on the telescope's size), some may want something stationary or for imaging.

Calibrating -&gt; Collimation of an reflector telescope sounds intimidating at first, but basically you look through a collimation eyepiece and turn three screws on the bottom of the telescope until everything apears centered. Don't read any of the on-line tutorials until you have an actual telescope to try it, otherwise you'll get an headache :-) Once you've followed a guide you can basically check &amp; adjust your telescope in one minute or so (if it's neccessary, most reflectors hold collimation quite well, even the little flex-tube).

 - See [the first picture here](http://smasweb.org/?tag=telescopes)(ABC) or at [this tool overview](http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165).

You can either do it with no special tool (as in the first link or the "star test") or a filmcan/dustcap with a hole (or buy a $25 cheshire wich has benefits over the cheap bad laser tools).

Even if your mirror alignment is off, you can still see something. It will just reduce the contrast, especially at high magnifications.


Reflector telescopes have trade-offs (obsruction, difraction spikes, coma, collimation...) but other telescopes have their problems, too. The benefits of reflectors is that they are so cheap and can be mounted cheaply (dobsonian), allowing beginners to enter the hobby with something that'll show quite a bit (within the aperture's and our eye's limitations, of course).

.


TL;DR: Collimation is not really difficult, a reflector is the best bang for the buck despite a few down-sides.There are simple extension tubes, random example (other lengths, other fixation, price options) http://www.amazon.com/Orion-5124-Telescope-Eyepiece-Extension/dp/B0000XMUHI

also if the mirror sits at the very top of the collimation screws and it's just a matter of millimeters you can play with that.My guess would be that they more likely have a Prusa, Lulzbot or something like that, but you never know and it doesn't hurt to get more input and first-hand experience :-)

As you saw in the different articles (and my message) each printer has it's ups and downs. 

For your requirements (easy set-up, large build-area) there are quite a few suited solutions, and if you buy a reprap based machine you will be rewarded with a lot of freedom (both regarding hard- and software). As you saw in the tests/reviews the UP is not perfect but provides that out-of-the-box experience even for complex prints, but the ease of use results in it's largest draw-backs: Limited options (no extending the build size, no control over all the settings). Though this does not have to be a bad thing if you don't want to ever fuss with it anyway, and just need reliable prints without a lot of trial and error... then that's what you'll get. And trust me, even the easiest 3D printer will have a learning curve, but it's nice to have something that just works.

I hope you'll find the right printer for your requirements! :-) 

Hopefully I have not pushed you towards anything, but I do like to point out that there are quite a few options, even if they aren't always open hardware.Hi :-)

Something like one of these?

I have the exact same Barlow... And telescope! :-)

 I don't have the stuff here right now, but the Barlow itself works very well with my other eyepieces. But as I never use it with the kit 25mm eyepiece (as in: I never use the kit eyepiece) I don't recall having the same problem.

Don't get another Barlow. Especially with the kit eyepieces, the performance won't be good... And a better Barlow costs more than a decent eyepiece.

You can get a 3.2mm or 4mm  HR Planetary for high magnifications for under $40/25\u00a3 if you don't mind ordering at Aliexpress.  (The HR Planetary have 58\u00b0 apparent field of view vs the 50\u00b0 of the kit eyepieces, and decent eye relief even for the shorter ones. While the 2.5mm theoretically works, the image gets quite dark, you won't gain any visual details even with a bit higher magnification) 

and the 6/9/15/20mm Goldline eyepieces (66\u00b0) for 16\u00a3 in china and around 24\u00a3 in Germany and the UK. With the Heritage the full moon will fit into view with the 6mm at 108x, due to it's relatively large apparent field
 of view!

Seben Germany (the seller of your barlow) also has very cheap Pl\u00f6ssl eyepieces (under 10mm their eye relief is too short! Also the Seben 30mm sadly has no eye cup) and Efle eyepieces (17\u00a3, I have the 12mm and 20mm, the eye relief of the 12mm is still ok-ish but short)

I recommend  a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl, 12-15mm for deep-sky, 6mm for moon and many other objects, and the 3.2-4mm HR Planetary for planets.
No! :-)

The kit eyepieces are not that good, buying a more expensive  Barlow is a waste of money.

Two or three better eyepieces will improve the performance much more.

I have the exact same Barlow (Seben 2x achromat) and it's actually pretty good when I combine it with my Pl\u00f6ssl or Erfle eyepieces.Yes, that's a good idea :-)

Indeed, backfocus of newtonians is a bit of a deal. Though at least with dobsonians the lack of tracking limits it's use, and for planets you can usually achieve focus with a barlow. 

The new Bresser Dobson even comes with a 2.5" docuser in case you want to attach a full format DSLR :-) Too bad many "larger" eyepieces are 3" though, but attaching a $1000 eyepiece to a 8" that costs less then half would be a bit of an overkill anyway...&gt; because they're really sensitive to collimation

Not really. First of all, parents can check it once in a while. Second, it will still show a lot even if it's not spot on. More then a small telescope. And it's better then the department store sets that shake all around.

For kids, it won't matter if the contrast is not the best it could be. Is it noticable? Yes. When my 130P/AWB arrived, the secondary was tilted and the primary was not aligned well, but it still showed more than my 3" telescope.

I don't like the F/4 reflectors though, neither as dobsonian nor on a tripod. 

You don't need a cheshire to collimate, and even if, you can get them for $17 at Aliexpress, $35 in the US.

The AWB requires a piece of cardboard light-shroud if there's a direct light-source, yes. From a dark site it does not matter.Hello :-) Collimation of a newtonian is really not as big of a deal as you might think. It's confusing at first, but basically you turn three screws, look through/at a collimation eyepiece until everything appears centered. That's it.

Other systems do not require collimation --- usually. If they do (tipped it over etc.), things can get complicated. So being able to collimate a reflector is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for a portable telescope.Hello :-)

Depending on the age of your children, you could consider a Orion SkyScanner 100 **and** Celestron Cometron 7x50 for example.

Both are not the best, but within your budget and they show quite  a lot. The SkyScanner is not ideal for planets and requires something to put it on, but it's rigid, has a large field of view, easy to move and it's very compact.

There also is the Firstscope/Heritage 76p and similar very small 76/300 table-top telescopes, but they are very limited. Especially with planets in mind they are not good.

My favorite is the Heritage 130p (AWB Onesky in the USA), but it's over your budget ($199). But it's something that has potential for many great observations, the aperture ratio is not quite as critical, and it's still compact.

The sets on tripods often have one flaw or another. Most of the time the mount/tripod is just way too weak. Also there are a lot of short tubes with flaws, either a F/4 aperture ratio that shows a lot of coma and cheap eyepieces won't be sharp across the whole field, or the catadiopter with a flawed mirror and an additional lens (which results in some contrast and collimation issues).


There's also the Celestron c90 within your budget ($145). It's narrow field of view might not be ideal, and 90mm aperture shows less then the AWB, but it's better suited then the SkyScanner 100 for planets. You can mount it on your Manfrotto-tripod without any problems. It's also a great day-time spotting scope as the image will not be upside-down compared to the reflector telescopes.

Still, something wide-field is more intuitive for kids. BeanerSA provided some links to binoculars (free-handed for kids I'd say 5-8x magnification is the way to go, but the 15x70 on a tripod is a good idea!).

There's also sets like the Celestron Powerseeker 114eq (too weak!), but if you can get one used for $50 and don't mind building a simple rockerbox to put it on, this is a great budget solution that shows more then any of the above regarding planets. I've built rockerboxes with 5th graders and simple tools, it's not hard.



Telescope.com has "2nd"/refurbished sales on both the Starblast and SkyScanner telescopes by the way :-) So even the Starblast 4.5 which will perform a bit better then the Skyscanner 4" would be almost in your budget. But for $160+, I'd recommend either the AWB Onesky or the same thing on a more stable equatorial mount.

The Meade Instruments 216006 Polaris 130 EQ Reflector Telescope $179.00 (Amazon) for example. The "EQ2-ish" mount is not as rigid as the AWB (at least for such a telescope) but the combination is tolerable if you don't extend the tripod fully and perhaps put some additional weight on the base. The Equatorial mount might be too difficult for younger kids unless you set it up every time.

Also remember to pick up some star charts or a book (turn left at Orion, possibly something else depending on the kid's ages). Stars will remain stars, constellations can be best seen with the naked eye; Open star clusters with a wide-field telescope or binocular.

Good luck finding a good telescope! :-) Hello :-)

But the largest in this price range somewhat portable :-) 
It's not small enough for carry-on, though you can put just the tube in a backpack and the base into the luggage.


It performs a bit better than most of the F/4 short dobsonians, but has a few quirks, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew).


 
For portable Astro photography (on a budget) a camera + barn-door can go a long way [[1](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) [2](http://www.mpas.asn.au/Astro/Tips/dingaling/dingaling.htm) [3](http://www.astropix.com/bgda/sample2/sample2.html)]. Imaging without a tracking mount is very limited. Though I guess you could build a compact EQ platform for the AWB Onesky (Outside the US: Skywatcher Heritage 130p). 

There are small tracking tools such as the compact iOptron gizmos, but they are over the budget.


Without tracking, your results will be very limited ([5" dobsonian + CCTV](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=221)) and it can be tedious.Yeah, though it's a personal matter, with a wide-angle eyepiece it's not much of a problem for me under "normal" seeing conditions, but the EQ platform is nice to have and runs for ever on a 9v battery :-)Hello,

Or you could use a smaller piece, a spring, and regular cord, to measure a longer distance with just a small piece of actual flexible sensor cord.A simple method would be the L7805 and capacitors (for just the micro controller) :-)

https://www.sparkfun.com/products/107

The lights should not run off the voltage regulator (watch the maximum power ratings)


The 7805 will turn most energy into heat when turning 12v-&gt;5v, so there are more ideal solutions. TSR-1, Max1837Yes, the in-store pictures are usually misleading :-) Few stores show it with an actual person next to it, e.g. [here](http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html) or [there](http://www.zudensternen.de/Teleskop%20Skywatcher%20Heritage%20Dobson%20130.html)

Clear skies for your outreach event! :-)

Here's a comparison between 76mm, 100mm and 130mm table-top dobsonian, the width of the 130mm flextube is noticably larger...

 ...but it performs very well.Yeah, the 76/300 are neat toys, and while it is possible to see the rings of Saturn or cloud bands on jupiter, but  even in a 76/700 the experience is limited. A 70/700 refractor performs quite a bit nicer overall.

For deep-sky, some nice binoculars are probably a better investment. From my personal experience, I would not recommend starting with a telescope smaller then 4-5"*, as the price difference is moderate, but the difference in performance very noticeable.

I have used Ardublock to build robots with kids. It's a nice solution to avoid syntax errors and get results fast. But you will discover that it gets quite difficult to create more complex projects.

It's OK to make a few LED blink or control a servo with a sensor, but things get messy quickly :-) 

There are even Ardublock hardware kits (such as  [this](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-New-Ardublock-graphical-programming-learning-kit-Zero-based-learning-for-Arduino/2044893753.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.N3pq35&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_3,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1)) but I would recommend using "real" programming and the breadboard kits if you want to really get into the hobby. 

If you do not have a good knowledge of electronics, most things will be explained along the way, but books such as "Getting started in electronics" (very easy, great for students) or "Practical Electronics for Inventors" (still relatively easy but with more background information) will give you a better understanding of the basics.

.

I've read "getting started with electronics" as a student and later dabbled with Perl, PHP, Actionscript, Javascript and a bit with C. It was fairly easy to get started as the Arduino enviroment does most the work compared to programming microcontrollers in low level. 

So if you know a bit of C++ it should be no problem to get your head around programming Arduino. Most tutorials explain the basics very well along the way.

Good luck, have fun! :-)http://www.pa.msu.edu/sciencet/ask_st/052296.html

[Milk](http://www.planet-science.com/categories/experiments/weather/2011/07/why-is-the-sky-blue.aspx)Hello :-)

A 8" dobsonian will show a lot and can last a life time. It reduces the gizmos and offers a simple but rigid base, so most money goes into the actual optics.

You could also check out the Zhumell z8/z10, but they are not available via Amazon. They include much better accessories than the Orion XT or Plus sets, though. The 2" wide angle eyepiece alone is worth $70, a good finder, smooth focuser, collimation tool are also better.

The dobsonians should be no trouble to transport with your car despite their size :-) For planets, light pollution plays little role.

Here a few links on what to expect in different apertures: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622 

All telescope kit accessories are not perfect. The eyepieces are typically very simple. But do not buy a eyepiece box set (overpriced, mediocre quality; Cheap barlows reducing the contrast) or zoom eyepiece (narrow field of view at one side of the settings). You can typically get two or three decent wide-angle eyepieces for the same money.

For a 8" or 10" dobsonian you should at least have a 2" wide angle eyepiece (focal length depending on the light pollution and telescope aperture ratio), a ~6mm for around 200x (more is not always usable due to atmospheric seeing conditions), and one or two inbetween, especially for deep-sky observations.


Also a guide such as "turn left at Orion", a dim red light (will preserve night vision better then any cellphone display) and possibly a telrad finder ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) [2](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif))  under dark skies.http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.pngHi :-)

I get random values occasionally as well, so either take an average or exclude odd values

e.g.

    if( (value&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (value&lt;1000) ) { dostuff(); }
    

Also try the newping library for example; http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing

Take a bunch of sensor readings -&gt; Take the average and/or exclude all values that are way off;

    //int repeats=6, rcount=0, currentReadings, average;
     int uS = sonar.ping(); 
    
    if(rcount&lt;repeats)
    {
     rcount++;
    currentReading=uS/US_ROUNDTRIP_CM;
     readings=readings+currentReading;
    
     }
    else
    {
     average=readings/rcount;
     readings=0;
    rcount=0;
    }


Quick pseudospaghetticode.

.

To exclude odd readings

    currentReading=uS/US_ROUNDTRIP_CM;
    //ignore overly high readings, if currentreading is smaller than double the current average
    if( (currentReading &lt; 2*(readings/rcount) ) || (readings==0) ) //(or readings has no value yet)
    {
     rcount++; //increase counter
     readings=readings+currentReading; //ad valid  value
    }Awesome!Same concept, use a minimum threshold (if val&gt;10...) or ignore readings that are suddenly  too low (e.g. if the last number is more then twice as large as the recent distance, something isn't right, if lastvalue&lt;(2*value){do();} )

.

Or, to adapt the previous post's snippet:

 not suddenly too small AND not suddenly too high 

if average&lt;twice the current reading AND current&lt;twice the average

e.g. last values 200, 190, 210, so average of 200



if( (    ( (readings/rcount)&lt;(currentReading*2)) &amp;&amp; (currentReading &lt; 2*(readings/rcount) )    ) || (readings==0) )

if the reading suddenly equals 500 or if it's below 100 it should be filtered.

At my tablet right now, I hope you can make sense of it all. 

Of course this is a simplified approach, as changes from, say, 2cm to 5cm would make problems and aren't unlikely, so you could ad something like *|| ((readings/rcount)&lt;10)* for short distancesIf you switch the sensors, or remove one, does the problem occur as before? Try to narrow down if one is faulty.

Also the newping library easily supports multiple sensors.Glad I could help :-)Perhaps it's just a quirk in the code :-) Also try to wait a bit so sensor A is not picking up sensor B.That's simply wrong and misleading for beginners. Not everyone is able or willing to put down the money for a $400 telescope.

Even with a $100-$200 telescope you can see a lot, despite the limitations and limited choice of good sets.This!

Also, Hi! :-)

A 8" dobsonian such as the Zhumell z8 or XT8 sells for $399 new, but you can occasionally get them at CL, /r/telescopedeals or Cloudynights for under/around $200.


A dobsonian might not look like the stereotypic telescope, but the simple base is rigid and cheap, leaving less to desire and more money for the actual optics.

If you can increase your budget, consider the Zhumell z8 for $399 new. Compared to the smaller 6" dobsonians for $300, it includes accessories that are easily worth the price difference AND it shows quite a bit more (link at the bottom of my lengthy reply). The wide-angle eyepiece included with the Zhumell sets alone is worth $70 or so and beat the Orion XT/XT Plus kits. Plus the focuser, finder, etc.



As for **new** telescopes in your budget range, there are a few options:

- 6" Dobsonian ~$310

 -  SkyWatcher 150p (better focuser), Orion xt8 (widly available in the US), Zhumell z6 (not avl. iirc). Shows the most of this list, is very sturdy. Eyepiece kits are typically very basic but there are a few budget options for later.

- AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p) $199

 - Compact, affordable, despite a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) one of the best telescopes in this price segment. Even if you ever upgrade, it has a good resale-value or doubles as a travel telescope.

- Meade  Polaris 130 EQ (Or celestron Astromaster 130EQ) $179

 - Same as the Heritage/AWB Onesky. The closed tube and focuser have benefits, the EQ2-type mount is not ideal but tollerable for these telescopes. A better mount would cost more then the whole set, this is why you'll usually find EQ1 or EQ2 mounts in entry level kits.

- Orion Starblast 4.5" (refurbished/2nd at telescope.com $160)

 - Nice table-top telescope,  it's F/4 aperture ratio has a few flaws, especially regarding high magnifications and cheap eyepieces. It's ideal for the porch or balcony (using a table or similar).

- Celestron C90 $145 + sturdy camera  tripod

 - It's a spotting scope. It's 90mm aperture can be limiting, but it's very, very compact. The image is up-right so you can use it as day-time spotting scope as well as travel telescope. It's longer focal length limits it's use for wide-field deep-sky, but it makes it easy to observe the planets with cheap eyepieces, not requiring a barlow or more expensive short quality eyepieces. Maximum useful magnification is around 180x though.
 
- Orion Skyscanner 100 ~$100

 - It's cheap, it's a table top telescope. It's not suited for high magnifications but much better then the small 2.5" or 3" telescopes, especially when it comes to deep-sky. It's the ideal porch-telescope to view the moon, get a quick&amp;small glimpse of Saturn or Jupiter, or observe larger star clusters and things like the Orion nebula. It's F/4 aperture ratio has a few flaws, especially regarding high magnifications and cheap eyepieces. 

- (used) Celestron Powerseeker 114 (or similar) &amp; DIY

 - The EQ1 mount is too weak;  [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlcSC7IQB0) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV92ncjF5-Q) [3](https://youtu.be/_R5_tAaI1G0)] - This might not seem like a big deal, but it is, especially at high magnifications and when trying to align and focus! It'll wobble with every touch or even breeze. The word tedious would be an understatement :-). But you can get such sets for under $50 used occasionally and build your own rockerbox mount. For the new price of $90-$100 I would probably consider another option. I built mounts for these used 4.5" telescopes with 5th graders and simple hand-saws, so it's really possible for everyone :-) With a sturdy mount this telescope shows a lot and can compete with the AWB Onesky or the Orion xt4.5 (which is basically the same thing).

.

**Do not** buy catadiopter/bird-jones telescope. These are easily recognized: A newtonian reflector telescope that's much shorter then it's specified focal length. An additional lens in the focuser extends the focal length of a flawed "short" mirror. In this price range these have contrast&amp;collimation issues. Most common: 114/1000, 127/1000, 150/1400, e.g. the Celestron Astromaster 114 or Powerseeker 127. Also avoid eyepiece kits (overpriced, mediocre) and zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view on one side of the setting), you can usually get two or three decent (wide-angle) eyepieces for the same money.

.


The main thing is the aperture. Here are simulations on **what to expect** visually when using different size telescopes: [Older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)

.

Do not underestimate the use of **binoculars** :-) Even the cheap Celestron Cometron 7x50 will show a bunch of galaxies, nebulae and clusters, cost around $35, and you'll benefit from the wide field of view when getting started. They compliment using a telescope well, I never go observing without taking binoculars along as well.

"**Turn left at Orion**" - The missing manual. With a dim red light (Astronomy supplies or even $1 bike light + tape layers) it preserves night vision much better than a cellphone display; Compared to apps it does not only show you where to observe, but what's worthwhile observing in smaller telescopes, how to observe, and what to expect.

**Size comparison** 3", 4" and 5" table-top telescopes

 - http://www.waloszek.de/astro_sw_dobson3_e.php

Size of other sets 

 - http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html

(A larger 6" or 8" dobsonian can be easily used while sitting. You can get them into almost any car-&gt; Tube on the back-seat, base in the trunk. Each part weighs under/around 10kg/22lbs. A shorter 6" telescope on a *rigid* tripod weighs as much as a 8" dobsonian! :-))

Sometimes a smaller travel telescope can make more sense then a huge telescope in a light polluted city, at least for deep-sky observations.Yes you can, I posted a list as reply to another post. Check the used market. Else there are a lot of choices (Skywatcher 150/Orion XT6, AWB Onesky, Polaris 130, C90) depending on what you want to spend, how portable it needs to be, and what targets you are most interested in.Hello :-)

Depending on your light pollution ([how dark is your sky?](http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2010/12/06/how-dark-is-your-sky/)) you could get a 2" wide angle overview eyepiece, e.g. 30-36mm. 

Rule of thumb: Aperture ratio of the telescope times visible magnitude equals maximum eyepiece focal length.

More will result in a large exit pupil (eyepiece divided by aperture ratio of the telescope), larger then your pupil dilates under the given conditions. The sky background will be gray-ish (bad contrast for deep-sky)  and not all light will reach your retina ([older doodle](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/exitPupil_and_secondary.png)).

E.g. under  a sky with visible 5magnitude, don't get more then 30mm.

7mm exit pupil is only possible under truly dark skies (Namibia, out in no-where) and with "young" eyes (though the actual age does not always play the main role).   

Budget 

 - http://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html

 - http://www.universityoptics.com/2inch.html 

The 30mm80\u00b0 is a cheap modified Erfle, maning the outer field's decreasing  sharpness and coma will be more visible then in the 30mm ~70\u00b0. With a F/6 telescope, it's still tollerable, and you have a larger field of view. Also see [this](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg).

A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl would show the most for a 1.25" eyepiece but despite it's low cost ($22.50 at Corvus optics) it won't show much more then your current one. There are also dome 2" eyepieces like the DeepView IIRC that are just in a larger barrel but despite costing more they don't show a noticable larger field of view.

.


For the med-range and higher magnification, you could consider the Gold-line (no-name version of the Orion Expanse). They cost $48 at Agena Astro, when available $30-35 at Corvus optics, and $24-$30 at dhgate or Aliexpress (Chinese sellers).

Their 66\u00b0 field of view makes it easier to observe &amp; track at high magnifications, here's a comparison between a kit eyepiece and a wide-angle eyepiece: http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png - The Planet won't move out of the view so quickly. Also cheaper eyepiece such as smaller Pl\u00f6ssl have a too short eye relief under 10mm.

The 6mm (-&gt;200x, most usable under normal seeing conditions) and 15mm (ideal exit pupil for many deep-sky objects) and the 2"~30mm will make a good basic kit. There are a few gaps, but you can always fill them later or use the kit accessories you already have.

.

These are the budget solutions. If you are willing to spend a bit more, look into the Explore Scientific 82\u00b0 eyepieces. But the 2" eyepieces almost cost as much as your telescope ;-) There are of course a few choices in-between such as the HR Planetary, BST Explorer, Baader Hyperion / Aspheric... But the ES82\u00b0 will cost only slightly more while performing almost as good as high-end eyepieces, while the "gold line" cost barely more then Pl\u00f6ssl while performing well for their money... With limitations and a limited choice of focal lengths.Hi :-)

Yes, the quality can be varying greatly.

I've bought a bag full of ESP8266 ESP-201 for under $2.70 for school projects, the ESP are a great value. Luckily the soldering job of mine look decent. But who knows, perhaps they spray-paint them afterwards to make them look shiny :-)


Good luck with your projects, may the solder joints be with you.Awesome!

That's really advanced for a first project despite doing the kit examples.

I hope it works well!I've had parts printed at Shapeways a couple of time and wanted a 3D printer the first time I've seen a video of a Reprap.

PP3DP hat a discount program (recommend it to someone and they  will get one cheaper), so I managed to get a UP Plus in 2010/2011 for around half back then.

The magnificent automatically generated break-away support back then and the great print quality without many settings, plus not having to build my first printer, convinced me to buy one. Despite it not being open hardware.


 I've been in cat-on-hot-tin-roof-mode until it arrived as I never heard of them before and I could not use a payment method with buyer protection. But it came. Customer support was great, and I got it up and running quickly. To this day it's the best out-of-the box experience I ever had with a 3D printer, as it just works.
 
While there are so many good 3D printers available now, the UP (or the Afinia H) still does rather well in the Make 3D printer comparisons for three years in a row. But it's not open source / open Hardware. This is both the biggest advantage (Just works well with little to adjust) and down-side (limited Materials, settings) of their printers.

I later joined the Printrbot Kickstarter, which was a neat tinkering experience despite the casted parts back then, helped build a Mendel, and recently received my &lt;$200 Hobbyking Mini Fabrikator (TinyBoy). While it does not match the quality of the UP, mine works quite well out-of-the-box! I won't be using it for my tiny precision models, but small technical parts and "larger" (8x8x8cm max) stuff from Thingiverse will print well on this. Also I do workshops at a local school where this little one will be great.

If I had to choose now, I would probably either get the UP Mini (for a hassle-free solution) or buy/build a Prusa i3, Lulzbot or Tricolour/Kraken multi-nozle printer (for tinkering).Hi :-) That's what I got my first 3D printer for, too... Now I am doing all sorts of stuff, rarely RC parts... Funny how things can change once you find other uses for the machine :-) Have fun with your 3D printer and safe landings!Perhaps choose a seller/store that also offers decent soldering stations ;-)Variables, milliseconds :-)

Please ask questions if you need explanation.

digitalWrite(led, !digitalRead(led)); might be confusing. If the LED is currently on digitalRead will return True. But with the "!" it will return False, the state is inverted. Yeah, these things can be quirky. The newPing will return 0 if it's too far away too, so I always exclude 0 results.

    }Hello :-)

I've read on [SGL](http://stargazerslounge.com/topic/254474-asteroid-86666/) that it will be around 15 magnitude, so too faint for your 4".

You could try Comet Catalina C/2013 US10 if you're on the southern hemisphere :-)  Also check out https://www.heavens-above.com/ for what's visible from your location.
Comets are nice and some even visible in binoculars; You can see their trail and even some faint color, but don't expect too much.

You will not see their surface or anything. Too small, too far. Something a few hundred meters or a few Kilometers across  is barely visible/resolvable even though it may sound close compared to other objects in the solar system. Apparent size is relative.

Regarding Jupiter: The telescope is not ideal for high magnifications, as it's F/4 focal ratio has a few problems: The secondary needs to be large (large obstruction results in lower contrast), the mirror would require an ideal parabolic shape, and you will need short focal length eyepieces for higher magnifications. Also F/4 will show a lot of coma (distorted stars in the outer field) and cheap eyepieces will only be sharp in the center.

The telescope comes with an 25mm eyepiece (16x magnification at 400mm focal length) and a 10mm eyepiece (40x). The 2x Barlow will double that, but both the eyepiece and barlow are not the best regarding contrast.

You can get a HR Planetary eyepiece in 2.5mm or 3.2mm focal length for $35-$40 at Aliexpress or a bit more locally. Or the 6mm gold line for $24 and use it with the barlow (or possibly a better one for $25, but I am not sure how good or bad the included one really is. A dedicated eyepiece is usually performs the best).

Cheaper eyepieces such as the $17-$23 Pl\u00f6ssl are available in 4 and 6mm but their eye relief is horribly short. Also the mentioned eyepieces have a larger apparent field of view that makes finding and tracking easier (see [this](http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png)).

I would not go much above 150x or so, as with this telecope you won't gain much. BUT even at 60-80x you can see the rings of Saturn and at least the two main cloud bands of Jupiter. But you could use a $5 color/contrast filter to make it a bit easier.


Stars will remain stars. They are too far away, and even our largest telescopes can only resolve few large and close stars (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Betelgeuse_VLT.jpg))

How dark is your observing location, where are you at?

From a dark site (can you see the milky way?) you should be able to see a lot of nebula, clusters and such. Even under moderate light-pollution there's the Orion nebula, open star clusters such as the Plejads, h&amp;chi persei, the Coat-Hanger cr399 (and other colinder list objects!).

Do you have "turn left at Orion" or a similar guide? It's the missing manual. It will not only show you where to find objects, but how to observe, which ones are worth observing in small and medium sized telescopes, and what to expect, too.

Many expect to see things they have seen on TV or other media, so either computer generated images of other stars or colorful galaxies and nebulae, often made by stacking minute or hour long exposures and heavy editing, sometimes even composing images taken outside the visual spectrum. Our eyes are not that sensitive, and sometimes it just takes a dark location and patience :-) Many objects will just appear as faint fuzzies, but if you keep observing you might spot some structure. It's amazing to see those objects with your own eyes despite the limitations. For example Galaxy M51. In 5" it was two faint glows, but after observing it 40 minutes I even managed to make out some faint details, even from the city limits. Pretty good, though compared to the Zhumell z8 it lacks of a 2" eyepiece (e.g. [this](http://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html), $70, or ~36mm under darker skies) plus collimation cap or something.

Also it's still stating that there is one left at Amazon :-) z8 out of stock again? Argh! :-)If you are looking for a complete kit with guide, the official starter kit, Sparkfun inventor kit or similar are great starting points.

If you perhaps have a bit of previous experience (in any programming language, really), and/or feel comfortable following on-line tutorials, there are many cheap kits with tons of components.

E.g. [this large set for $23](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062) (shipping from China) and [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874).

Hello :-)



What do you want to observe? How dark is your observing location (can you see the milky way)? Can you transport the telescope (car)?

A 12" is noticeably larger and heavier then a 8". A 10" or 8" is a bit more manageable. If the 12" is too big, there's the 12" Flextube from skywatcher, but the weight is about the same.


If you need to buy at Amazon I would recommend the basic variant and get some better eyepieces separately. But the selection at Amazon is limited, and some are more expensive there. If you where not limited to Amazon I would have suggested the Zhumell z10 or another model as it includes much better accessories in the basic kit then some of the Plus-kits of other brands.


Instead of the Intelliscope consider a tracking eq-platform or better eyepieces. The kit eyepieces of the XT Plus are not that good. For the price difference of the Plus set you can get some better ones.

For a 8" dobsonian you should have a decent 2" 30-36mm overview wide-angle eyepiece, something along 15mm (ideal exit pupil for many deep sky objects) and 6mm (200x / planets under moderate seeing conditions).  Possibly also a better finder scope (Telrad from a dark location, 8x50 right angle finder is also a good option).

The 2" eyepiece will cost $70 (GSO 30mm, SWAN33mm, 30mm80\u00b0) and up, the smaller 6mm&amp;15mm (1.25") will cost $24 (china) / $48 (agena astro) / $70 (brand name: Orion Expanse).


The Orion 28mm DeepView 2" eyepieces from Orion don't really show more then a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl for $22, and are basically an old eyepiece design in a larger barrel. 


A good overview eyepiece isn't cheap but makes finding and observing larger structures easier; http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg.

"Shorter" wide angle eyepieces will make tracking at high magnifications easier and have a better eye relief;

You could also use a Mosfet, random link: http://www.kriwanek.de/arduino/aktoren/304-lasten-mit-power-mosfet-schalten.htmlYeah, you can get them at Conrad too I think, or the components, but the modules are so cheap it really does not make much sense to build your own for a simple task (unless you need other specifications).

If you are in no hurry, you can get these modules for &lt;=1\u20ac or so at Aliexpress or eBay from China, and under 22\u20ac it's tax&amp;duty free.

I order a lot at Aliexpress for school projects, but check the seller/reviews.

A mosfet would have some benefits regarding longevity and power consumption.Stimmt :-)
Es gibt auch fertig aufgebaute Mosfet-Module, bei Amazon fand ich aber nur teure. Conrad d\u00fcrfte aber Mosfets in H\u00fclle und F\u00fclle da haben.

(There are also mosfet-modules, Amazon does not have cheap ones though; Conrad will have lots of single Mosfets in stock)

//edit: Depending on what you are switching, and if you need PWM or reverse the voltage, you could also get a dirt-cheap double H-Bridge module. The smaller ones can handle up to 0.6A and 1.2A peak, the ones with heat-sink up to 2A or so. These modules cost $1-$3 at Ali, 4\u20ac at Amazon. I'm using these for the 2wd robot kits.We know we are in the milky way as we can see it at night :-)

It's form is a toughy, but thanks to careful observation, radio astronomy and perhaps a ping of the mediocrity principle we know quite a bit about our own galaxy, or at least what it may or may not look like;

- http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/93-the-universe/the-milky-way/general-questions/480-how-do-we-know-the-milky-way-is-a-spiral-galaxy-intermediate

We have a spacecraft (Voyager) currently leaving our solar system, it will be a few years though until it even reaches the next star (40,000 years or so). Even if we could reach something remotely close to light-speed (solving all fuel/mass/construction/engine issues), it would still take a few decades. And that's just to the next star.  Crossing or  leaving our galaxy is not really something we are capable of, at least in a moderate time-frame. The Andromeda-Galaxy will probably be here much sooner... so we wait. :-) And observe what we can. A lot of smart cookies figure out techniques to look behind the curtain, or clouds of gas in this case.Congratulations! It' pretty low to the horizon by now, but it's still amazing to see it with your own eyes. I've seen it in my used sub-$20 telescope and was hooked. So much to explore.What time did you look?

 Venus should be visible as very bright star a few hours before sun-rise. Avoid looking into the sun at any cost though, especially with your binoculars this can result in instant and permanent(!) damage of your eyes.

It's almost new moon, and (here) it rises around 5am.

What binoculars do you have? Do you have a book like "turn left at Orion"? In the morning, try to find the Orion nebula. The constellation Orion is rising later at night, the "belt" of three stars is very prominent. http://eyesonthesky.com/Blog/tabid/80/EntryId/86/How-to-find-Messier-42-the-Great-Orion-Nebula.aspx 

There are also a bunch of star-clusters, galaxies and other nebulae you can observe with your binoculars if there's little light pollution and no moon light.

Venus should appear as dot, but you can see it's phases. Jupiter's moons will be visible as a chain of "stars" next to it.


The moving object might have been a plane with landing light or a quadrocopter. If they are closer then you expect they can seem to move pretty quickly, while still not audible. Satellites do not change direction, but changing brightness of iridium flares and [autokinetic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokinesis) may play tricks on you.In the center of our vision there are a lot of cone cells for color reception, but they are not very sensitive. The ~~cone~~rod cells in the outer field are  more sensitive. So many objects will be visible in your peripheral vision but be invisible if you directly look at them.

There's even the "blinking nebula" that's invisible in smaller telescopes as soon as you look at it. If you look at it directly, you see the central star. If you look away, the nebula becomes visible. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6826

Even within light polluted areas binoculars can show a lot. 7x50 if you have lower light pollution, or under less ideal conditions something  like 6x30 or 10x50 (depending on what you are comfortable holding steady as it's a bit harder to focus on an object at night for a long time). Even some mediocre $35 binoculars will do if you are on a budget (e.g. Celestron Cometron, or some of the cheaper Bresser binoculars).


Hello,

we have similar conditions - currently no car, faint milky way visible :-)

Aperture is key - a larger telescope will show more, especially regarding deep-sky. [See this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

A refractor on a rigid(!) mount will can  be pretty bulky. If you are looking for something that still fits into a backpack, the options are limited.

The Heritage 130p (AWB Onesky in the US) is what I use the most. It's certainly has it's flaws, but it's overall a good telescope for it's price. Also see [this older post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew). It's a bit low to the ground. Yes, it' a technically a table-top... Personally, I can use it with a small camping stool, but you may need a small footstool or similar to put it on, or a bench, tree-stump, spur at your observing location etc.  It's not as small as the Heritage 76 or Firstscope or the 4" table-top telescopes.

Even if you take along a small foot stool to put it on, it will be more compact then some tripod solutions and just offers more aperture.

You can of course put it on a tripod/mount as well, the Heritage 130p has a dovetail mount.  Used you can get a suitable mount for under \u20ac50 occasionally.  New they cost as much as the telescope, it's actually cheaper to buy a set most of the time.

There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq and Celestron Astromaster 130eq, but that's A) more bulky and B) the tripod is not the most stable (a better mount such as the NEQ3 will cost as much as these sets!).

It weighs 6kg, I can fit it into a larger back-pack (or just the tube into a smaller backpack while carying the base in my hand).

//**edit**: I don't know the stores, but here it is extraordinary cheap: http://www.villenkello.fi/shop/kauppa2/products.php?action=show&amp;id=3638&amp;show=all  and they also have the gold-line eyepiece http://www.villenkello.fi/shop/kauppa2/products.php?&amp;action=show&amp;id=996&amp;show=all

.

I have refractors, dobsonians, eq mounts... But for me, the h130p is what I consider truly portable without having to settle with a small aperture.

The 70mm refractor is nice, but it will limit what you can see both regarding deep-sky and planets. The mount and length do not exactly make it easy to transport either (but a long tracking backpack might do).

There portability issue is the bottle-neck (unless you buy some ultra-light travel truss-tube dobsonian, but they cost much more).

While refractors might seem less bulky, it's because they usually have a smaller aperture in this price range. But they will require a sturdy mount, and then it can get both bulky and expensive.

Not really compact either:-)

 - 3.5" refractor http://www.zudensternen.de/Teleskop%20Skywatcher%2090-900%20auf%20EQ-2.html
 

Let's take a 90/900 refractor on EQ2 for example. The set costs 200\u20ac, weighs 10kg, the EQ2 is too weak to be considered ideal for this set-up, and the next larger NEQ3 mount would cost over 250\u20ac alone. Also the 90mm aperture will show less then a 5" reflector regarding deep-sky.


There are also short refractors. In this price range they are simple FH refractors that will show a lot of chromatic aberration if you magnify higher, so they are more suited for wide-field. They are however very compact. (http://www.zudensternen.de/Teleskop%20Orion.html)

.

Another solution are the Maksutov telescopes, they will probably fulfill your requirements a bit better, but the larger ones are more expensive. The 90mm and 102mm Maksutov for example. The Maksutov design is very short, and a fairly rigid camera tripod will work just fine. They won't show quite as much as the 5" dobsonian, and their long focal length show a rather narrow field of view. The 127mm Maksutov is over your budget though (350-400\u20ac without mount). These make nice travel telescopes. I often take my 3/4" Mak along, but for deep-sky, the 130p just is more fun (and despites the quirks the larger aperture has some benefits when observing planets compared to the smaller Maksutov).

.

If you would feel comfortable using a bike hanger you could also get a 6" or even 8" (used) dobsonian. They just show the most for the buck, the mount is stable, and with the long dobsonians you can easily view when seated. From the cottage it would be mind-blowing compared to the fairly light polluted skies at your home town.

) from the Astroshop.de website 
.

Computerized mounts: Most money will go into the electronics, leaving less for the actual optics. Especially in this price range that makes no sense. I have a Nexstar SLT mount, and while it's a nice gadget, I rarely use it for visual observations. Finding things takes some practice, but with a good map/book it's not hard and fun to do.Yes :-)

The gold-lines are available for \u20ac30-\u20ac40 in europe ([[de](http://www.ebay.de/itm/OPTIKWELT-UWA-Okular-6-mm-66-Weltbestpreis-/271987088225?hash=item3f53b19b61)] [[de](http://www.astroversand.com/Skywatcher1-p369h8s68-OPTIKWELT-UWA-Okular.htm)] [[uk](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/wide-angle-eyepiece-1-25inches-66-degree-F-6mm-/131598870176?)] ...or cheaper in [[china](http://www.dhgate.com/product/new-1-25-quot-31-7mm-66-deg-wide-angle-eyepiece/212648260.html#s1-2-1a|431070659)], still under tax&amp;duty-free value).

Here's the cheap 3.2mm

 - Germany http://www.ebay.de/itm/Sky-Watcher-TMB-BURGESS-HR-Planetary-Okular-3-2-mm-58-WELTBESTPREIS-/281806879014?hash=item419cffb926

The cheaper Pl\u00f6ssl offer a smaller apparent field of view, and the shorter Pl\u00f6ssl eyepiece's eye relief is so short that they are nearly unusable.Glad I could be of help :-) 


Also consider "Turn left at Orion" which is the missing manual and useful for naked-eye, binoculars and telescopes. 

Binoculars work best under dark skies and have their limits, so if you are in a light polluted area and comfortable spending a bit more you might want to consider a small telescope for planets and brighter DSO :-) (Orion SkyScanner 100, Celestron C90, a 114/900 reflector, AWB Onesky/Heritage 130p...)Not Orlet, but yes, they will fit.

The 6mm gold line will be very universal, it'll still be usable later.

A 3.2mm eyepiece will typically give you a very high magnification with a larger telescope (e.g. a long focal length dobsonian or Maksutov).  On a 200/1200 dobsonian that eyepiece would give you 375x magnification - theoretically it works, but the seeing conditions rarely allow over 200-250x magnification. And Deep-sky objects are often observed with lower magnifications anyway (medium magnification, 2-3mm exit pupil).

A barlow is another option, but a dedicated eyepiece typically gives you better contrast.

For the Heritage 130p, the  3.2mm HR Planetary, 6mm gold line, 15mm Erfle, and 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl would be ideal. But probably overkill at the beginning :-)


The 25mm kit eyepiece is OK, the 10mm tolerable, so you could also just get the 3.2mm HR Planetary if you just want a planet eyepiece. Combining the mediocre 10mm kit eyepiece with a mediocre barlow does not give great results. 

Also wide-angle eyepieces are very nice to use and make tracking at high magnifications easier :-) I love the 6mm for the Heritage. 108x magnification, the full moon fits into the wide-angle view, and it's also nice for star-clusters and some DSO. For deep-sky objects I often use a 12mm eyepiece.Hi :-)

Heritage 130p-&gt; Accessories-&gt; Check out the link to my older post, here it is again: 

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew

But even as-is, it works quite well. The included eyepieces are not great, something for higher magnification and one or two wide-angle eyepieces would be nice to have. And a collimation tool (collimation cap, cheshire).

Dedicated eyepiece VS eyepiece plus barlow ... Here's a crude simulation: http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/saturnmagHeritage.png
Too much will just make the image darker and not show you more details.

.

6"-&gt; It will be a bit too bulky for the bike in my opinion (edit: Also, weighs more!), check out some youtube videos for a better idea on how large it is.
A 1200mm newtonian reflector will be over a meter long. The 8" dobsonian is the same just thicker btw.

Random video for the 6": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHb2ZMXtAiY - In the background you see the Starblast 4.5 (left, green) and a reflector and refractor on the right (guessing 114/900 and 90/900) Whoops, wrote cones twice :-)Hi :-)

Well, again, the XT8 plus is overpriced, IMHO rather get better accessories separately :-) If you can manage to trade the gift cards, the Zhumell z10 + two "gold line" eyepieces would be the best bang for the buck.

Do you plan on taking images with the telescope? Imaging with the dobsonian won't work well. Astro imaging is much more complicated. Also the Skywatcher dobsonians seem to have a bit more back-focus.

What to expect in different apertures: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

But even in smaller ones you can see a lot! Especially with a guide such as "Turn left at Orion". :-)

If you already have a DSLR you can do some imaging even without expensive equipment. https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivceI was thinking of two thirds, four fifth or something like that. :-)Nice pictures, congratulations on your observations! :-)This; You can get a eyepiece or barlow for more magnification for $11-$25 if you are on a budget.

The AWB Onesky is a good alrounder in this price range. It has a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but it's one of the more stable kits in this price range and overall a good performer.

There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq for $179, basically the same thing, but not as compact and on an equatorial mount that's a tad too weak for such a telescope (but some find it tolerable). 

The shorter F/4 table top telescopes are even a bit more problematic when it comes to observing the planets.

The 3" refractors and reflectors just don't show as much and cost nearly as much. Here are a few links on what difference aperture makes: [M\u00f6\u00f6p](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)

There's also the Celestron c90 for $145 (if you already own a rigid camera tripod). Compared to my h130p/AWB Onesky it does not perform as well regarding planets (as the smaller aperture is a bit limiting) and deep-sky is limited too, but it is a nice travel telescope that's also awesome for day-time observing as compared to a reflector everything is not upside-down :-)

Also check the classifieds (CL, Cloudynights, /r/telescopedeals). Sometimes you can get a 6" or even 8" dobsonian for ~200 dollars... with a bit of luck and patience.

There are also the 114/900 telescopes on weak mount. New they start at $100, but used under $50 sometimes. If you don't mind building a simple rockerbox ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg) [2](https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/)) you can basically get a $200 telescope for $50. I did this with 5th graders to turn some old, used telescopes into cheap dobsonians.

Also consider "turn left at Orion" (the missing manual on how to observe, where to find objects, what's worthwhile observing, what to expect), a dim red light to preserve night vision (budget: $1 bike tail light + layer of tape), and some binoculars (budget: e.g. Celestron cometron 7x50 $35). And one or two eyepieces, depending on the telescope you've chosen.

Works in Germany.This. If you have some prior experience with any programming language and/or feel comfortable following an on-line tutorial ([1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) ...), get a random kit such as [this one](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062) (China, shipping times! Else look around at [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ultimate-UNO-MEGA-2560-for-Arduino-20-Sensor-Starter-Kit-for-Beginner-LCD-USA-/181880715138?hash=item2a58ef7782), Amazon, local electronic stores).

If you need a more structured guide, get the Arduino starter kit or Sparkfun inventor kit etc.

MAke sure to get a motion/pir sensor (included in the first kit) and a ultrasonic distance sensor ($0.[70](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Ultrasonic-Module-HC-SR04-Distance-Measuring-Transducer-Sensor/1979768585.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.19.LuxTyK&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_3,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1)-$1).

A simple method would be to use the PIR motion sensor combined with the ultra sonic sensor (hand must be waved in a certain area, height etc.)It's the exact same :-)

It'S a great kit. It lacks a few things (hc-sr04 ultra sonic sensor, perhaps a relay,...) but it's overall a good starting point, has most of the things used in the tutorials and samples, and enough parts to come up with own ideas.http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/

Hi :-)

Good suggestions so far! :-)

As /u/mycatkilledabird wrote, you should check for a used telescope. A 8" dobsonian would show a lot, or a 5" Maksutov as portable solution.

As for new telescopes, the 6" Dobsonians would perhaps suit your needs and budget. Less compromises then the $100-$200 telescopes, better performance :-) Currently this one would be within your price range and leaves a bit of buget for a good book (Turn left at Orion) or an eyepiece to get more out of the set. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z4G3D22?keywords=skywatcher%20dobsonian&amp;qid=1444579738&amp;ref_=sr_1_10&amp;sr=8-10

Through a window is always a bad idea (air currents or glass), and a 8" dob will outperform a 5" Mak, but a large dobsonian is too bulky for most balconies. 

/u/Soarrunwalk already mentioned the Heritage 130p (AWB Onesky in the US). It is not ideal for planets, but performs much better then most telescopes under $200. There are a lot of sets in this price range that are either on a weak tripod/mount, have flawed optics, or both. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew)'s a bit about the quirks of the little 5"  bucket.

There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq ($179) and Celestron Astromaster 130eq ($199). They have some benefits over the AWB, but the EQ mount is not exactly the most stable for these. If you don't extend them fully, they are tolerable.

.

Here you'll find a few links showing what to expect in different sized apertures: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

Only Saturn, Jupiter and Mars show noteworthy surface details, so something capable of showing you some deep-sky objects is always worth considering :-) Deep-sky-objects are visible all year around. Also portability, just in case you need and/or want to take it to someplace with less light pollution for deep-sky observations.

A larger telescope won't necessarily be able to "look further". Even with bare eyes you can see the Andromeda Galaxy from a dark location, and even in small binoculars you can see dozens of galaxies and nebulae. It's all about (surface) brightness. There is so much to explore, even in small instruments! :-) It may not look as neat as on photographs (long exposures, heavy editing) but it's something special to see a remote galaxy with your own eyes.


Anyway, if you do not want to max out your budget, there are a few other options. For example the Celestron C90 for $145. If you already own a rigid camera tripod this makes a great portable telescope that's also good for day-time use. The smaller aperture does not perform as well as the 5" despite the aperture ratio. In the end, the larger aperture wins.

There's also the Orion Skyscanner 100, but it's not ideal for planets.

The Celestron Powerseeker 114eq is a great telescope, but on the very weak EQ1 that's not made for such a long tube. So while it is available for under $100 shipped once in a while, I would not recommend it if you are willing to spend a bit more. You can however get these 114/900 telescopes for under $50 used once in a while and build a simple rockerbox for $5 or so, using very simple tools. 

.


What not to buy: Eyepiece kits (overpriced, mediocre, redundant), Zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view on one side of the setting), and Catadiopter/Bird-jones telescopes (newtonian reflectors with a much shorter tube then their specified focal length, an additional lens in the focuser extends the focal length of a flawed "short" mirror. These designs usually have a few issues in this price segment, e.g. collimation and contrast).The atmosphere is very thin and the lack of a (strong) magnetic field  won't protect the atmosphere from solar winds.

There have been ideas to extract oxygen from the soil, and also hydrogen as fuel; There's something around 1-3% water in the soil IIRC. 

To get a atmosphere dense enough to sustain life from earth, there would be many obstacles to overcome. It would probably be more feasible to create a dome or turn a canyon into a habitat/greenhouse.

Else: We all know what happened to Arnold in Total Recall when he went outside!Hello :-)

My vote goes towards the larger aperture. A  4.5" shows a lot, but the 8" will have more then twice the suface area-&gt; Shows fainter structures and has a higher resolution, too.

Also see the links @ https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622 that compare different apertures.

So the 8" will show a lot more, and if it still includes the kit 2" eyepiece, that would be a great deal! :-) Of course another one or two $24 gold-line eyepieces would be nice, but even with the kit eyepieces (and possibly the ones you have) the 8" will show a lot more.

You could sell the 4.5" for other accessories or keep it as portable set-up.

If you want to keep the 4.5", you could get the Corvus optics $17-$23 Pl\u00f6ssl (though under 10mm the design has a too short eye relief). A achromatic barlow for $20 can work, but you can get pretty good budget eyepieces with short focal length that would perform better (e.g. gold line, $24 at dhgate or Aliexpress, $48 at Corvus optics; HR Planetary for $38 or so). For a 4.5" with 900mm focal length, a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl as overview eyepiece, a 4-6mm wide-angle eyepiece with decent eye relief for planets (e.g. HR Planetary or gold-line), and possibly one or two inbetween for deep-sky objects, e.g. the 15mm gold-line or a Pl\u00f6ssl.Hi :-)

This. This all the way.

None of the telescopes listed, and preferably from an Astronomy store. Always take in-store reviews with a grain of salt... Many enthusiastic beginners who have never compared their purchase to other telescopes.

The best bang for the buck is a 8" dobsonian. Aperture is simply one of the key aspects of a telescope. While a good refractor of same size as a reflector will have some benefits, the larger reflectors tend to be much cheaper and just show noticeable more. See the [links in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

There's the Zhumell z8 for $399, but it's currently sold out. It includes better/more accessories, especially the 2" wide angle eyepieces and micro step focuser are well worth it.

The Skywatcher 200p is currently on sale.

The Orion XT8 is widely available but even the Plus-set has worse accessories than the z8.

.


Accessories that would help to get the most out of the telescope:

- If not included: A 2" wide angle (70\u00b0) eyepiece (GSO 30mm-36mm depending on your light pollution, $70, or SWAN33mm for example). ([See a crude collage on wide angle vs kit eyepieces](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg))

- A 6mm wide-angle eyepiece, e.g. the "gold-line" ($24 at dhgate or Aliexpress, $48 from Agena Astro **edit:**Corvus optics has them for $30-$35 again) for 200x magnification. More is possible, but the atmospheric seeing conditions often limit you to 200-250x. Of course there are better eyepieces (Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0), but the gold-lines are good budget wide-angle eyepieces and have a longer eye relief then cheap Pl\u00f6ssl eyepieces.

- Ideally, a 15mm "gold-line" as well.

- "Turn left at Orion" - the missing handbook on how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, where to find it, and what to expect.

- A Telrad-finder &amp; map if you observe from a dark location. It can make finding nebulae a bit easier.

- A collimation tool if not already included, a simple collimation cap will do.


.

A 8" is of course pretty large. For something more portable, there are other solutions; E.g. a 127mm Maksutov or the AWB Onesky. If you plan on imaging - which is more difficult then it may seem to beginners - you should check out the astrophotography [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescope) and save a bit more.

.

- What do you want to observe?

- Have you used a telescope before?

- Is there an Astronomy club/society nearby, or a stargazing event? You should visit them before spending any money.

- How dark is your sky, can you see the milky way? 

- From where do you plan to observe, and would/could you drive out a few miles to a darker location? 

Hello :-)

Check out Stellarium for the computer (Free), Night sky tools (Android) for example.

There's also http://heavens-above.com/ and https://www.calsky.com/. I hope you can the z8 for that price (if you choose that option)  and that it's in working order with all the accessories, that would be a great deal.

Clear skies, keep us posted :-)It even has a TV Show. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_das_BrotCongratulations :-) 

The included 30mm eyepiece is not great at F/5, but much better then the typical 25mm kit eyepieces you usually get.

It will show a much larger field, but at F/5, the outer field will not be sharp (crude simulation  at the bottom of [this](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg))

 A ES82\u00b0 24-30mm would still be a great addition and performs much better at F/5. 

.

For planets, something around 200x magnifications is ideal, as much more is  not always possible due to atmospheric seeing conditions. But it can be nice to have one for a bit more handy :-)
 
For deep-sky, something with 2-3mm exit pupil is beneficial, so for a F/5 telescope that's 10-15mm.

.

So ideally, 30mm ES/12-15mm ES/6.7mm Explore Scientific 82\u00b0. 

Of course three eyepieces isn't ideal but covers most bases.

There's also the AstroZoom; Compared to wide-range zooms it's apparent field of view does not change; http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=astro-zoom&amp;min=0&amp;max=0 (The Lacerta are also nice 82\u00b0 wide-angle eyepieces even though supposedly not quite up there, but I did not have a chance to compare them myself; I use the Astrozoom with a HR Planetary)

.

On a budget, the 30mm kit eyepiece, the 15mm gold-line ($24 at dhgate or Aliexpress, $30-$35 back in stock at Corvus optics!, $48 at Agena Astro) and the 6mm gold-line. For that price these eyepieces are tough to beat, still nice wide-angle properties, though of course (most) of the ES82\u00b0 are a different league.  

.

Also, if you observe from a dark location and are looking for deep-sky objects,  a Telrad  ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) [2](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif)) can be a very nice tool to easily locate DSO.

Clear skies! :-)


//edit: On a side-note, the gold-line can be "zoomified" with the Astrozoom as well (http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?);
I added a few things to my post, sorry :-)

The gold-line for $24-$35 are a great choice, have a good resale value, and will get you more then started. Two or three will probably be more beneficial than one ES only. But the upgrade will be quite noticeable when you come around to it :-)Hello :-) 

Under light polluted skies and for planets the Telrad won't be of much use; For deep-sky I agree though, it's a great addition.

Regarding planets and tracking: With a decent wide-angle eyepiece manual tracking over 200x magnification is not too hard. It will take a bit to get used to if you are new to dobsonians/reflector telescopes, but it's not a big deal.

With a 6mm 66\u00b0 eyepiece for $24 (dhgate) to $30 (Corvus optics) a planet will stay in the view for 79 seconds (at 0\u00b0 declination), with a Pl\u00f6ssl-type eyepiece (52\u00b0) it's 62 seconds. [Comparison](http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png). This is one of the reasons why not to get cheap eyepiece kits.

The 8" will show a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

Sadly the Zhumell z8 is out of stock (again). It offers the best accessories (even compared to the Orion XT8 *plus*. Though the Skywatcher 200p dobsonian seems to currently be on sale, so you could get that, add a 2" wide angle eyepiece (e.g. $70 30mm70\u00b0 GSO @ Agena Astro, or the 30mm80\u00b0 from universityoptics, or the good SWAN33mm for example).

@Komm: The TMB Clones are available from $38 or so at Aliexpress, Corvus has them for around the same price (but very limited stock). Agena Astro has them for $55.Hello :-)

I live in Kiel, right at the town-sign :-) While it's nothing like on photos, I can see the milky way here. A mile further out it's still faint but hard to miss. 

If you live near Cologne in NRW  for example that's of course a different situation. But my point is that sometimes even a few miles will improve the conditions greatly.

Away from direct light sources (houses, streets) and with adapted eyes (no cellphone display, no flashlight for half an hour) you'll also see a lot more.
.

The astronomy community in Germany is pretty large. You will find a lot of societies, clubs, observatories, where you can find people that know best from where to observe :-) 

Not knowing where exactly you're from,

http://www.astrotreff.de/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=True&amp;TOPIC_ID=135008

https://kbaforum.wordpress.com/

Check out Astrotreff.de, Astrotreff-Deep-sky.de; There are even maps of others, so you could try contacting someone nearby and ask if they can recommend and observing location nearby.

Light pollution maps can help you to  narrow down in what direction you'll find a nice &amp; dark spot, but they are not very accurate. 

http://www.lichtverschmutzung.de/seiten/karten.php
 

.

Do you have binoculars? Of course they can not compensate for a dark skies, but even near a city you'll be able to spot a few star clusters, nebulae, galaxies. 
Budget? Targets? :-)No need for a GoTo, really :-)

With the Telrad and good maps it's almost as good, minus the whole alignment procedure.

An EQ Platform can be very nice though for a dobsonian.

.

I don't know about the unspoken rules here, but as many stores sell them, I don't see a reason to not talk about them. For under $40-50 they are decent, and most of the time perform better than a Barlow in a similar budget.

The Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 are even nicer though, but cost three times as much.

I use a 8mm HR Planetary in a [AstroZoom](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?) and the only down-side is that over 200x magnification the 58\u00b0 apparent field of view *could* be a bit larger :-) But due to seeing conditions I am usually just using the 6mm 66\u00b0 anyway.

If you are setting up your phone as digital setting circle, consider http://www.greatredspot.com/Red%20Eyes%20Filters.htm as the astronomy App's red-mode is typically still too bright and not really deep-red, at least with classic back-lit displays.



Hello :-)

Manual: 

Strange that their are no instructions in the box :-( But telescope sets tend to have bad instructions with the lack of guiding a beginner into actually using the telescope.

If all fails, there should be lots of video tutorials on how to use your telescope on Youtube.


Finder:

The red dot finder is a neat gadget, you just have to look straight into it, no matter from how far away.

 - https://youtu.be/i8AeHuW1e0k?t=144

 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpEm_7wBAhc

The advantage of the red dot finders is that it does not matter from how far or close you look through them, as long as you look straight through them. Take it off and try during the day. At night you need to dim the brightness down, else it will overshine faint stars.

Also they do not magnify and do not show more stars compared to finder scopes, making it a bit easier to orientate yourself at the night sky.  Optical finder telescopes often overwhelm beginners as they show much more stars and just a small field of view.

A Telrad is a better solution (under dark skies) as it shows multiple circles that make it easy to target objects according to maps. ([Crude example](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif)).

Or a right angle 8x50 optical finder scope. 

But any finder will let you find the "beginner objects" relatively easy.

A guide such as "turn left at Orion" for example is more valuable then investing into more accessories right away.

.

Eyepieces:

 As it has been mentioned, there usually is a extension tube in the box;

What other eyepieces do you have?

.

Clear skies :-)Oh, yes, an OLED screen is an exception as they don't have a backlight and can produce "True red" :-) If you still feel it's too bright there are a bunch of apps overlaying the screen to make it dimmer.

Yes, EQ platforms are no easy task, but there are a lot of guides and commercially available ones (though $300+ is not exactly cheap; In my experience, a wide-angle eyepiece will be a better first investment).Hi :-)

Barlow VS Eyepiece

A Barlow will double the magnification, but especially the lower budget ones will introduce chromatic aberration, efectively lowering the contrast.

The included Pl\u00f6ssl type eyepiece is not bad and will work with the Barlow.

But especially when you want to observe Planets, something around 200x magnification (more then 200-250x is possible, but only when the atmospheric seeing conditions allow) and a larger apparent field of view is nice to have.

Here a simulation of a 52\u00b0 degree eyepiece (Pl\u00f6ssl-type and many other kit eyepieces) and a 66\u00b0 wide-angle eyepiece; http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png

.

Field of view

With a larger apparent field of view, finding and tracking objects will be a bit easier. At high magnifications, a planet will stay in the field of view quite a while longer in a wide-angle eyepiece. 

Plus it's very nice. A wide angle eyepiece can give you a spacewalk effect.  It's less like looking through a tube but more like looking through a port hole on a shuttle ;-)

But Pl\u00f6ssl are solid, cheap eyepieces. They start at under 20 bucks and work well. One reason why Barlows are popular is because the shorter focal lengths of the older eyepiece design has a short eye relief. A 4 or 6 mm Pl\u00f6ssl is nearly unusable as you have to press your eye so close that it makes no fun.

The "Gold line" eyepieces are a good budget solution that's just a bit more expensive then a Pl\u00f6ssl. $24 in China (dhgate), $30-$48 in the US (Corvus optics/Agena astro), \u20ac30-\u20ac50 in Europe (DE:Astroversand; UK:dyejar, ebay; Fi:villenkello).

For a larger overview, the 25mm could be replaced with a 2" wide angle eyepiece; Here's a simulation on different eyepieces at a similar focal length: http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg

.

Possible eyepiece palette

So for a 8", a good eyepiece starter palette could be:

- 30-36mm 2" 70\u00b0 Eyepiece (depending on how dark your sky gets)

- 6mm Gold-line for Planets and small DSO

- one or two inbetween, e.g. the 15mm gold line which has an ideal exit pupil for many deep-sky objects.

Of course the sky is the limit when it comes to eyepieces. The Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 for example are still somewhat affordable and almost high-end quality.


Stuff to avoid:

Eyepiece kits (mediocre, overpriced, redundant) and wide-range zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view at one side of the setting) should be avoided though. Except the Astrozoom, (\u20ac100 kit, \u20ac250 with a 82\u00b0 ultra wide angle eyepiece), it does not cover as wide of a range, but the apparent field of view stays the same and it's ideal to adjust to the maximum magnification possible under the current seeing conditions.

.
 
TL;DR: 30mm70\u00b0, 15mm66\u00b0 and 6mm66\u00b0 eyepiece for example.Hello :-)

Shop:

First of all, also check out Teleskop-Express, in my experience (and when you search around the german forums) they give much better advice then the other shop.

SLT vs Skymax

There's also the Celestron Nexstar SLT127, which has an identical telescope but the auto alignment and battery compartment are a bit better then the Skymax IIRC.

A 5" Maksutov is a nice device. It's a great portable telescope, ideal for a balcony, and the Nexstar SLT or Skymax-mounts are nice gadgets. The telescopes will be at their limit though, especially fully extended and with a DSLR attached you'll notice some stability issues.

It's quite possible to get a few nice shots of the planets, moon and brighter DSO with that set-up. But be aware that astro imaging is not simply point&amp;shoot as day-time imaging.

The 130/650mm refector version of the SLT does not have enough back-focus and is more suited for wide-field.


Down-sides:
 
The Simple mounts are AltAz (Altitude, Azimuth) tracking mounts, so after 20-30 seconds you'll notice field rotation. For serious astro photography a (motorized) equatorial mount is necessary.

Also be aware of the down-sides of the 5" / 127mm Maksutov. There might be some slight vignetting, and the aperture ratio does not allow you to image fainter objects with that set-up. The longer focal length will make tracking and stability issues much more noticable, too. Even visually, the cool-down time and smaller maximum field of view can be a downer.

If you plan on wide-field imaging, this is most likely not the right set-up for you. If you also want to primarily observe visual, the 5" will show much less then a larger manual telescope in the same price range.

For the same money you can get a 8" or 10" dobsonian, which will **show much more**. See https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

With a manual 8" dobsonian for example, imaging the moon and planets is possible, but tedious as you will have to keep the objects in the view by aiming with the finder scope. 

The upside of a 8" is that you can see the spiral structure of some galaxies (from a dark location &amp; with patience), while in a 5" telescope, they'll be mostly faint blobs. 

.

Still, a 5" telescope can be a lot of fun. I have one and use it a lot, due to the smaller size.

You can also image without a telescope. Either from a fixed tripod, a DIY barn-door tracker,  or just the telescope on an equatorial mount. See [[1](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) [2](http://www.mpas.asn.au/Astro/Tips/dingaling/dingaling.htm) [3](http://www.astropix.com/bgda/sample2/sample2.html)].
A 4" Mak is a nice telescope and shows quite a bit! :-)

Along with some decent eyepieces this is a nice portable telescope.

It's amazing how much aperture you get for your money these days.

Clear skies!What focal lenght(s) do you plan on getting?

For the longer focal lengths the Gold line or Erfle types offer a wider field of view, but overall the Planetary (or BST Explorer, or X-cel) are very nice eyepieces in this price segment.Glad I could help! I just noticed I totally overlooked your username, in Canada the options are a bit different, e.g. the cheap 8" from [kwtelescope](http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html), and the $49 gold-line eyepieces from Maisonastronomie and the 2" q70 32mm from kwtelescopes for example.

If your budget is $300cad, that will limit you to the good 6" or portable 5" dobonian; Though as mentioned you might get the 8" used (Skywatcher 200p, Orion xt8, Zhumell z8,...), and the price difference between the basic 6"/8" dobsonian ($319 vs $372) isn't too big and you'll really see a bit more with the 8". They also have the telesopes with eyepiece kits, but you're typically better off buying the mentioned eyepieces instead to get the most out of the set.Hello :-)

Is the current mount broken?

The problem is that mounts such as the EQ1 or EQ2 often cost more seperatly then some of the telescope sets with these mounts :-) E.g. Celestron Powerseeker 114eq or Meade Polaris 130eq. But the Powerseeker 114eq is not very rigid, the telescope is great though. If you can get one (used) and build a simple rockerbox, it's a great telescope.

The Az3 mount costs $99 (at least at Astropete's), but of course that's not an equatorial mount.
 

You could try to find a used mount or set (Astromaster, 
Powerseeker, ...) at ebay, the local classifieds, or a forum (e.g. iceinspace.com.au).

Instead of spending so much for an mediocre mount for the 76mm refractor, you could sell it and buy a Heritage 130p, which is sometimes available for $250aud. I know this is over the budget you mentioned, but it would show a lot more in any regard. ([Links on what to see in different apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622))

Heritage 130p http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-heritage-5-dobsonian-telescope.html (AWB Onesky in the US)

It's a bit low to the ground but The rockerbox is pretty rigid. Comparable sets such as the Celestron Astromaster 130eq is much more expensive and not as sturdy. There are cheap and sturdy solutions to get the 130p a bit higher (such as the cheap Ikea Bekv\u00e4m, or crates... Also see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew))

//edit: EQ1 $149 http://www.astronomyalive.com.au/saxon-eq1-equatorial-mount.html  - but that's still a lot of money for the weakest EQ mount out there. Used, you can sometimes get one for under a third of the retail price.

//edit2: 
 andrewscom has some surplus/used/refurbished AZ2 and AZ3 mounts as well as complete kits for $39/$79/...I'd probably recommend the 6mm "gold line" then, it's 66\u00b0 afov is very nice, and 200x magnification is more versatile;

4mm will give you 300x, which will only work if the seeing is very good and the targets are not close to the horizon.

I've just realized I wrote most of this stuff in your post about the z8, sorry for the redundancy :-)

Anyway, 6mm 66\u00b0

The z8 will be smooth enough to manually track with the 58\u00b0 of the 6mm TMB (clone); But 300x will be a bit tedious :-)

For more then 200x, the ES82\u00b0 are great; http://www.optcorp.com/explore-scientific-4-7mm-82-degree-waterproof-eyepiece.html But I'd still recommend something around 200x as "main" eyepiece for normal seeing conditions.

Both the gold line and the HR Planetary work with the Astrozoom by the way ([this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?)), but not with the ES82 (but with the [Lacerta 82\u00b0](http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=lacerta%20uwan&amp;min=0&amp;max=0)). Compared to other zooms the apparent field of view stays the same.Hi :-)

Great!

The ES14mm82\u00b0 is neat :-)


Isn't the swa 26mm a bit redundant with the 30mm kit eypiece? Or is the light pollution that bad there?

The gold line are great gap fillers, and Corvus optics has them in stock again, too.

Clear skies!Hello :-)

A 114/900 (4.5", F/7.9) is a great telescope. Sadly the mount is a bit too weak (do not extend fully. Put weight on the center plate. This can increase the stability). 

Alternatively you can build a simple "rockerbox" with $5 worth of material. I did this together with 5th graders, with a bunch of used&amp;refurbished telescopes.

 - http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg

 - https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/

 - It may not look fancy, but the dobsonian rockerbox is a rigid mount.

.



Also the eyepieces are not that good, the H20 (lowest Magnification, 900 divided by 20mm = 45x) should be usable though. The 6mm will have a narrow field of view and short eye relief. The barlow combined with the 6mm will give you too much magnification and is nearly unusable as the image will get very dark. For the moon perhaps. The barlow also ads chromatic aberration, effectively lowering the contrast.

With the 20mm+Barlow (90x) or the 6mm (150x) you should be able to see a bit of detail on Jupiter and Saturn (if you can still manage to spot it), but be aware that they appear relatively small. More is only possible under good atmospheric seeing conditions and limited by the aperture. Over ~225x the image will get dark without gaining much detail.

If the eyepieces &amp; focuser are 0.96" diameter, it's a bit difficult to get better eyepieces (but there are adapters, I am just not sure if this model will reach focus with one). If it's a 1.25" focuser, you can get decent eyepieces between $17 and $35 :-)

A good basic set of eyepieces would be 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl, 15mm gold-line, 6-4mm gold line or HR Planetary (But too much magnification is not beneficial, see http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png -  200x, 225x max.) or a achromatic Barlow.

.

1- In general: Yes.

2- Planets (e.g. Jupiter). Double stars (Albireo). Clusters (M13, coathanger, Plejads, h&amp;chi Persei). Many brighter nebulae (the Orion Nebula, ring nebula) and galaxies (Andromeda, M81/M82...). Consider getting "turn left at Orion", it's ideal for  small to medium telescopes. The missing manual on what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, and where to find it.

3 - Yes, but do not get an eyepiece kit. Buy two or three decent eyepieces (depends a bit on the focuser diameter and your budget, I can provide you with links to suited eyepiece then, e.g. maisonastronomie has the "gold line" eyepieces pretty cheap, or you can import them from china).

4 - Dust does not influence the performance as much as you would think. Cleaning can cause more problems (Micro scratches for example), so leave it as-is for now. Only finger-prints, dirt &amp; pollen should be removed. A mirror is best cleaned "contact-less" and wet, e.g. rinsing with distilled water or isopropylic alcohol, only dabbed with cotton balls.

 - Turn left at Orion &amp; dim red light (budget: Bike tail light $1 + tape layer) :-)

 - In the Sticky  you'll find links on "how to align and how to use an equatorial mount" https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2f0goy/for_anyone_posting_what_telescope_should_i_get/


TL;DR: Congratulations. Use as-is for now. A good book and perhaps eyepieces would be beneficial.Neat. I suppose the 14mm will be your work-horse for many DSO, so that's a good choice.

If you get the $35 6mm66\u00b0 you are pretty much set for a while.Hi,

Yes, those are the gold lines, cheaper att dhgate or aliexpess china. They are modified Pl\u00f6ssl and have a wide angle view, but they are 1.25" barrel eyepieces.

Measure your focuser or existing eyepieces, older telescopes usualy have a 0:96" focuser.

You can still get K(ellner), (H)uygens and similar older, small eyepieces, but if you can use newer ones they have a longer eye relief and wide-angle views that make searching and tracking easier. But observe with what you have, it'll work :-)

Given the mount, possible older focuser and need of accessories, you could probably get a different telescope by the time you bought all kind of accessories, this is why using what's there is the best idea. 

A book like turn left at Orion or simple Stargazing will be the most vital first step (imho).Actually under a dark skies the massive amount of stars visible in a 8x50 can be much more confusing for beginners.

The zero magnification is more intuitive, and with Telrad maps, finding deep-sky objects can be a lot easier then with the narrow field of a optical finder.Hello,

yes, that would be such an adapter.  It'll only work if the back-focus is rather far out. E.g. try if you can still focus if you would not insert the eyepiece into the tube. If you try during the day remember that relatively close objects will have a different focus distance.

If you have a workshop, 3D printer, or something like that, you could also make a 0.96" barrel.

Corvus Optics USA is a bit cheaper but shipping and import tax will make them almost as expensive as the better gold-line eyepieces.

1"/0.96" Eyepiece sets from ebay, surplusshed are usually of similar type and quality then your included, but the 12.5mm is rather common

 - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Telescope-965-size-three-Eyepiece-kit-6mm-12-5mm-20mm-Great-Value-/361394200665?hash=item5424c5e059#shpCntId

 - The MA are a bit better, http://www.ebay.com/itm/Meade-1-25-MA25MM-MA17-5MM-Economy-2x-Shorty-Barlow-Lens-eyepiece-Bundle-kit-/231616846056?hash=item35ed7098e8 

 - if the 1.25" adapter works, it opens the possibility to use better eyepieces with larger apparent field of view and more comfortable eye relief.

Right now you have 20mm, 6mm, and effectively 10mm with the Barlow, so start with that :-) 

Three eyepieces and an adapter almost cost as much as another telescope ;-)Hehe, yeah, eyepieces are really the hidden cost of this hobby.It was invented by a german and since he retired it's made somewhere else and sold by teleskop-austria.

Shipping is somewhat between 15\u20ac-18\u20ac or so for small parcels, according to their website, but you could contact them and ask how expensive it is to ship just the zoom.You can also try to find or make a spacer tube yourself, e.g. effectively turning a 6mm gold-line into a 3 or 4mm eyepiece. There's a barlow-type element in the barrel (http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=820). But with the AstroZoom it's pretty neat to be able to change it.

Baader offers such spacer rings for some of their eyepieces, so it's not uncommon practice. Baader does have a zoom, but it's apparent field of view gets smaller as well (as with most wide-range zooms, though the Baader has 68-50\u00b0 or so which is better than the cheaper ones that have  60-40\u00b0) Hi :-)

That's a nice little refractor, I am sure it's a blast, especially for the moon, planets and star clusters.

.

I don't know the brand, but there are many similar kits like this. Some are just re-brands and they all have similar features. What would you like to know?

Thanks for the image of the label :-)

It's a 60mm refractor  (~2.4") with a focal length of 700mm.

700mm divided by 20mm eyepiece = 35x magnification

700/12.5 = 56x

700/9 = ~78x

The eyepiece revolver is a nice touch! It does make it a bit easier. Some of them are even designed to make observing parfocal, eliminating the need to re-focus after switching magnifications.

 

The Barlow will  tripple the magnification and only make sense with the 20mm eyepiece.


You could get a 6mm eyepiece -&gt; ~116x, for planets it will perform a bit better compared to the kit eyepiece with barlow (offers more contrast, a larger field of view makes tracking easier and looks stunning, and the eye relief is longer, too).


Do not buy zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view on one side of the setting) or eyepiece kits (overpriced, mediocre). If you want a few better eyepieces, there are a few nice options such as the "gold line" 66\u00b0 wide angle eyepieces (dhgate/aliexpress &lt;$30usd, canada maisonastronomie $49cad, Corvus optics USA $35usd), but (sadly) for two or three better eyepieces you can already get a better telescope. Before purchasing check if your telescope takes 0.965" or 1.25" eyepieces (barrel diameter). For *modern* 1.25" eyepieces there are also adapters.

There are some cheaper 6mm, but the eye relief is typically horribly short.

 
The rule of thumb for maximum magnification (for bright objects) is twice the aperture (mm), so 120x magnification.   Over that the image will get larger but also dark &amp; dull.

For deep-sky objects the 12.5 and 20mm offers the best contrast/brightness, e.g. for star clusters (Plejads, M44, M13, M3...) and nebulae (orion nebula, ring nebula, dumbbell nebula) and galaxies (M81/M82, Andromeda...). But 60mm is of course the bottle neck for deep-sky observations (See [this](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.binoviewer.at%2Fbeobachtungspraxis%2Fteleskopvergleich_deepsky.htm&amp;sandbox=1) for example).


.

Always start with the lowest magnification.

Adjust the finder scope during the day. Avoid looking into the sun (instantly and permanently damages your eyes) even if it includes a cheap eyepiece filter labeled "sun". If you want to observe the sun, a good filter (Baader Solar visual film) is in order.

Get a copy of "Turn left at Orion" - it's the missing manual on what objects are worthwhile observing, where to find them, and how to observe :-) It's ideal for naked-eye, binoculars, and small to medium telescopes.

TL;DR: Have fun with your telescope! :-) "Turn left at Orion" (and a dim red light) is an ideal guide. Apps are neat as well but have a negative influence on night vision even in night mode. Do not spend too much on accessories, it's often a trap ;-) (spending more then a new telescope would).I mostly doodle small sketches in my notebook just for my personal documentation &amp; progress, also very crude... It does not have to be art :-) But for me it's easier to remember and reflect when I browse old observation logs.I just had a bit of programming experience (though mostly PHP, AS, a bit of C) and followed a guide on how to program micro controllers, eventually lost interest.

Students asked me if we could  build robots. So I finally got started with Arduino after ignoring it all the time ;-) A few months later we where building them.

If you don't mind following some on-line tutorials (([1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) ...)) or (e)books, there are very cheap kits available that cover most of the parts needed for the tutorials. E.g. [This](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062) for $22.50, or you ad a bunch of [other parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874).

All the components are pretty much standard and you'll find them in any book/tutorial. At the Arduino website or on instructables you will find example codes for every module &amp; sensor.

At the small workshops at school we build these -&gt; http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Smart-car-chassis-Tracing-car-The-robot-car-chassis-With-code-disc-tachometer/32359953608.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.43.g1K4nS&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_35_36_71_33_72_34_73_74_75,201560_1

A ultra-sonic distance sensor (and optionally some wheel encoder to determine the driven distance) is enough to make a "smart" obstacle avoiding robot.

The basic code is very simple and it's easy to hook up ([1](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Schaltplan-562x1024.png) [2](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/arduino-robot-Skizze-824x1024.png)). If the distance sensor reads less than 50cm, shortly stop one motor to drive a curve. That's it. 

From there you can easily ad more stuff. E.g. back up a bit before turning. Or pan the sensor with a servo to look left and right. Or ad a ESP-8266 (201) Wifi module ($2.70) for connectivity. Or a TCRT5000 (cents) reflective sensor to prevent it from falling down the stairs. Or a  1838 IR-Receiver (from $0.08) to control it with a random TV remote. Or play with a microphone module &amp; uspeech for some (simple!) voice commands (there are dedicated speech recognition modules that perform better).The AWB Onesky (Or meade Polaris 130eq) will perform a bit better due to it's aperture ratio.

The Starblast 4.5 has F/4, meaning it is a tad more difficult to collimate, shows coma (elongated stars in the outer field), cheap eyepieces will not perform well (only sharp in the center), and overall it's not suited well for higher magnifications.

A 6" or 8" (used) dobsonian will outperform all of these.Hello, 

if you do not have astigmatism you can just focus with the telescope :-) For glasses you require eyepieces with at least 15mm eye relief, preferrably more.Hi :-)

Saturn is a bit tough as it sets early, but Jupiter, Mars, Venus can be seen in the early hours: http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury

Even with lower magnification, Jupiter's moons will be prominent, they look like a chain of stars. With a bit more magnification and patience you can see at least the two center cloud bands on Jupiter.

Saturn is simply amazing. With 60x and more it's rings will be visible. Even in a smaller telescope it's amazing to see it with your own eyes.

Venus will show phases.

It's possible to see a bit of structure on Mars (ice caps, darker areas), but it's a tough one (depending on the current distance, seeing conditions and telescope).

The moon will never disappoint :-)

Deep Sky: 

Many astronomy sites have tours &amp; suggestions, so also check out these for example:

- http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Fall/Andromeda.html

- http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/OrionTaurus.html

There's also a PDF version of "Turn left at Orion", but the paper version is much more useful IMHO.


A dark observing location (ideally somewhere where you can see the milky way with the naked eye) is key. For planets it does not matter.


Do you have Stellarium (Freeware) or something like Night Sky tools (Android)? These programs/apps show photographs (long exposures, stacked, edited images) so they do not represent the visual view. But it's great to learn about the night sky :-) You can even set up your telescope and eyepieces to simulate the field of view.


Do you have binoculars? They show a larger field of view and make orientation easier. When I started  I had troubles finding some objects in the narrow field of view of a telescope (often less then 2\u00b0) and I used the binoculars to narrow down the location.

Clear skies!Hello,

sadly many telescopes in this price range have flaws (stability, quality) and/or a small aperture, limiting what you can see.

The first-scope (and similar 76/300 table tops) is a nice telescope for kids, but you will soon get tired of it. Even with the accessories it does not show the planets well. With a 2.5 or 3.2mm eyepiece that costs as much as the telescope it's possible, but the little thing is more ideal for wide-field &amp; moon observations.

There are a few other options:

- Try go get a used 6" or 8" dobsonian. Less compromises, shows much more. New they cost $aud 328/$499 at andrewscom for example, you can sometimes get them for two thirds or even half the retail price used.

-  My personal recommendation is the Heritage 130p. Yes, I know it's over your budget ($240-$260), but it would show a lot more, and while it has it's [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew), it's going to show so much more then the smaller ones in a similar price range. Even if you ever get a larger telescope later, it will double as a neat travel telescope, and compared to the others it's resale value is good. There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq or the Astromaster 130eq, but they are either not as common over there or more expensive. Also their EQ mount is a tad too weak for the telecopes, but it's tolerable if you don't extend the tripod legs fully.


- The Orion Starblast 4", National-Geographic 114/500 ($169aud) or Skywatcher Heritage 100p ($150) will show a lot more then the smaller Firstscope/Heritage76. They are not ideal for planets either, but overall noticeably better than the small 3"/76mm telescope.


- You can get a 114/900 on a flawed weak mount/tripod for $200, but often used for $50 or so. If you don't mind building a "rockerbox" ($5-$10 materials from the hardware store, simple cuts with a hand-saw) you'll get a fantastic telescope. [These](http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-114mm-reflector-telescopes.html), don't get one with a much shorter tube than their specified focal length, e.g. the Celestron 114/1000 or 127/1000. I built simple rockerboxes with 5th graders to turn a few used telescopes &amp; OTA into nice starter scopes.

Some 114/900 or 130/900 come on a EQ2 which is somewhat tollerable, but still not very stable. http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/bedford/miscellaneous-goods/skywatcher-telescope/1091190791 The shorter 130/650 on EQ2 is a bit better.

Used offers I found:

http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Skywatcher-Heritage-130p-Flextube-/252123085507?hash=item3ab3b4fac3


This is also another version of the 114/900 on a even worse mount. [ebay](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Astronomical-Telescope-114mm-Aperture-675x-Zoom-/271256840510?hash=item3f282ae93e) (or also at andrewscom) - but if you can get it cheap and really do build your own rockerbox, it's a good budget option.


http://www.andrewscom.com.au/site-content-section-10-surplus.htm -&gt; 114/900 with a flawed mount or a 130/900 bare telescope for just $99, ideal to build something yourself, or a 8" for $299!Well, kwtelescopes has the 8" dobsonian for 372 cad, but unfortunately I did not see the 6" cheaper elsewhere. I'll look when I get home. Amazon US has the 6" skywatcher for 280 usd. Overall the 8" is the better choice. I"ll report later.Wow, great :-)

That telescope can show you nice things for years/decades, while with smaller ones you often feel the urge to upgrade soon. Be aware of it's size though :-)

The kit accessories are OK, though ideally, consider getting two additional eyepieces sooner or later, e.g. [6mm66\u00b0](http://maisonastronomie.ca/en/product-category/eyepieces/?add-to-cart=316) with decent eye relief for planets, 32mm70\u00b0 for a better [overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) - of course there are &lt;$20 budget solutions [, e.g. this if it's really tight](http://de.dhgate.com/product/productdisplay.do?seoproname=new1-25inch-31-7mm-5x-barlow-lens-metal-for&amp;itemcode=198520589) ). The next birthday/christmas perhaps :-)

While a 3" or 5" will show most objects as faint smudge, a 8" is capable of showing the spiral structures of some galaxies (under dark skies), and is great for planets, too :-)

The difference between a 3"/76mm telescope and 8"/200mm will be huge; ([links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622))Hello, consider a 3.2mm HR Planetary,

http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

it will perform better.

Otherwise get a achromatic barlow. Perhaps even a 3x achromatic barlow so you can reach 200x magnification for planets.

More then 200x does not make much sense though. While 260x is theoretically possible, the image also gets dimmer.

Hi :-)

Personally I like less then 10x as it's just easier to hold steady.

You can also get a 5" telescope within your budget, if you want to see a bit more detail. I find the combination of some 6x30 - 7x50 binoculars and a telescope ideal, and it doesn't even have to be the most expensive equipment to show a lot. (e.g. AWB Onesky/Polaris 130 &amp; Cometron 7x50)

If you don't have astigmatism you can focus with the binoculars and it'll be easier to see the whole field of view.


7mm exit pupil won't really be beneficial unless you live at a very, very remote location. The sky background is one thing, but also with a smaller pupil than the exit pupil "light is wasted". So in this sense, the larger magnification and smaller exit pupil can show a bit more overall. If you just have ~5mm pupil diameter under the given conditions anyway... The higher magnification will also mean the object is larger, the ratio ep / surface brightness can be beneficial. Of course you can still observe though :-)

Clear skies! 
Hello!

&gt; you can save up a couple of thousand dollars to buy a 12" scope and mount. 

Sorry, but that's terrible advice.


That just discourages beginners and gives the impression that you can not get into the hobby with a limited budget.

Not too long ago 3" and 4.5" telescopes where typical starter telescopes. And while of course a 8" or 12" would show more, it's still a lot of fun to start with something smaller (and cheaper).

Binoculars are great, but especially beginners want to see the planets. With binoculars you're mostly limited to Venus' phases and spotting Jupiter's moons.

You can not build a 12" for $200, especially $AUD. Even the mirror costs more. Sure, once in a while someone is selling a old big telescope or the optics for incredibly low prices, but for $200 you typically get a 8-10", tops, even with a lot of luck.I do not know the seller, but I recently saw this:

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Cheapest-Android-Tablet-PC-ProntoTec-A8-7-Inch-Dual-Core-1-5-GHz-4GB-ROM-Dual/32410294092.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.2.EUBPSJ&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1

I've ordered a $30 tablet at Aliexpress before, but from another seller. The tablet I received not the best (older version), but it worked. Check the seller ratings &amp; product reviews.

Depending on where you're from split the orders to stay under tax/duty free limits. There are similar offers for ~$30-$[33](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/7-Quad-Core-Tablet-PC-Pink-Tablet-PC-1512MB8GB-Android-4-4-Quad-Core-Bluetooth-WiFi/32341601180.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.bTajOX&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1).

rPi or similar, a small screen, power connector/battery will probably be much more expensive but it would be another option :-)Hi,

the 114/900 has good optics, but sadly the mount is way, way too weak for the telescope. If you want I can post the video links to demonstrate the stability issues. 

*Edit*: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlcSC7IQB0) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV92ncjF5-Q) [3](https://youtu.be/_R5_tAaI1G0)]  - this may not seem too bad for beginners, but focusing and tracking can be tedious &amp; annoying, even wind will cause vibrations. 

I'd either recommend the cheaper 114/900 or 130/900 tube and a DIY mount, or maybe the used $200 Heritage 130p from ebay :-)



That's one reason why overall the Heritage 130p beats most sets in this price range despite it's own quirks.Hello,

&gt;  (which is a good thing, I guess)

yes it is :-) Better safe than sorry.

If you aren't comfortable dealing with potentially dangerous voltages, consider something like https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10747

Another cheap "hack" is to take something like these dusk/dawn outlets and tape a LED onto the sensor (non translucent tape). http://www.amazon.com/GE-Automatic-Control-Photocell-18258/dp/B002DN2QKY/ref=sr_1_cc_4?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444844877&amp;sr=1-4-catcorr&amp;keywords=dusk+outlet (This one will be on when it's dark, so also if the Arduino/LED isn't powered. Others let you set when to turn lights on, so if the Arduino is off, it would be off too)

Regarding the shield: Look at the maximum voltage and Watt rating! Absolute maximum 48V 60W.

What lights do you want to power?Hello :-)

Where are you from, what's your budget? Why these?

What do you want to observe?

Can you see the milky way from your location?

.

Do you mean the  Orion Starblast (114/450), and if so, which one? [This](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-StarBlast-45-Astro-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/102684.uts)? There's also [that](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-StarBlast-45-Equatorial-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/99741.uts), which is more stable.

- These are of decent quality but the 
The larger aperture of the 4.5" will perform a bit better then the 4", and outperforms the other smaller ones. But the aperture ratio leads to a lot of coma and cheap eyepieces will only be sharp in the center.

- The SkyScanner is cheap (90-100 dollars) and a nice "porch telescope" for wide-field. It's use for planets is limited, the aperture ratio has the same issues as the 4.5".

- The small 90mm refractor is not ideal for planets/high magnifications (strong chromatic aberration)

- The SpaceProbe 3 will show significantly less in almost any regards and the mount is not good. I started with such a 3" and while it can show a lot, I would not recommend it for the price it costs new.


.

What is your budget?

For the same budget there are better solutions.

- For $200 used (sometimes less) you can sometimes get a 6" or 8" dobsonian (Zhumell z8, Orion XT8).

- The AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p outside of the US), good allrounder for $199. It has a few quirks, but overall it's one of the better sets in this price range. The aperture ratio is a bit less critical, it's not quite so small, already shows a lot.

- There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq ($179) and Celestron Astromaster 130eq ($199 currently). These have a similar mirror like the AWB. The mount might seem nicer, and while it is more stable than the simpler EQ1-type,  it's not ideal for these telescopes (focusing and tracking can be annoying). Putting the AWB Onesky on a crate or box (or Ikea bekv\u00e4m) is overall more rigid.

- The Celestron c90 (compact, a bit less aperture though, easier to reach medium-high magnification, very portable; You will need a rigid camera tripod though!) $149

- There are sets like the  Celestron Powerseeker 114eq (starting at under $100), but while the optics are good,  the EQ-1 mount is not really capable of supporting such a telescope satisfactorily. You can however get these for &lt;$50 used and build a simple rocker-box for $5-$10.

- Avoid the newtonian reflector telescopes that have a much shorter tube than their specified focal length; E.g. Celestron 114/1000 or 127/1000. They have an additional lens to correct the flaws of a short spherical mirror, causing contrast and collimation issues. Not worth it, as they don't really cost less.

.

TL;DR: For the same money, you can get a few better telescopes these days.

Also pick up "Turn left at Orion" (The missing manual, showing you what's worthwhile observing in small to medium telescopes, where to find it, what to expect), a dim red light (preserves night vision better than a cellphone display) and download http://http://www.stellarium.org/ :-)

Clear skies!Oh, allright, I was not aware of it :-)

As mentioned, that's a bird-jones/catadiopter, as it has a  long focal length (1000mm) but much shorter tube. The additional lens will cause some issues. Also the mount is not great, even for the short telescope.

The bad review at Amazon sums it up pretty well :-) 

Though usually the in-shop reviews tend to be *too* good, as they are often written by beginners who never had a different (better) telescope. So it should never be a base for a purchase decision.


.

For $200, the AWB Onesky would be one option, it has some advantages over the Orion starblast 4.5 and skyscanner. It will work a bit better with cheaper eyepieces and it's aperture will show a bit more, too. $11, better  $24-$40 for at least one more eyepiece would be ideal as the kit eyepieces do not reach high magnifications for planets.

Other kits have more eyepieces, but as a rule of thumb the kit eyepieces are not good. Also avoid eyepiece sets and zooms (overpriced, mediocre, redundant, short eye relief / narrow apparent field of view on one side of the range)

The AWB has a few [quirks, see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew). But overall I would recommend it over the Polaris 130 or Celestron c90.

As I wrote before, really do consider some used options or a DIY solution with a 114/900 (it's easy, I did that with 5th graders and refurbished/used telescopes) :-) 

Sorry for the double reply;

Something like this for example;

- Orion xt4.5", performs a bit better overall due to the relaxed aperture ratio, not the best deal but fair; http://smd.craigslist.org/for/5265731055.html

- Sometimes you can get a 6" dobsonian for around the same price, rarely a 8" for &lt;$200). Check on CL, /r/TelescopeDeals/new/, local classifieds, ...

- DIY mount + Cheap 114/900, e.g. http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/for/5264182529.html - With some DIY work ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg), [2](https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/))... You can basically get what a $200 telescope can do  for $40 :-) (A bit more usable but still a very weak mount-&gt; [link](http://baltimore.craigslist.org/for/5211259506.html))

This :-) Alternatively, you can even get a used 114/900 reflector or 90/900 refractor for under $50.I like the AWB onesky, but it's not suited well for imaging (focuser type, backfocus, open tube, manual tracking, etc. etc.).  A 8" dobsonian would not be either.

The problem is, that you need a (equatorial) tracking mount for imaging, at least anything beyond snapshots. The mount alone will cost $300 without motor (cg4, NEQ3 or similar).

For imaging, you don't even need a "powerful" telescope. Even with just a camera lens a lot is possible if you have a tracking mount; http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY

Wide-field imaging works on a fixed tripod or DIY barn-door; [[1](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) [2](http://www.mpas.asn.au/Astro/Tips/dingaling/dingaling.htm) [3](http://www.astropix.com/bgda/sample2/sample2.html)].


Visual and imaging never go together well on a budget.

There are the Nexstar SLT series mounts (not equatorial, the smaller telescopes won't be ideal for neither visual or imaging), same for the skywatcher virtuoso.

There's the Celestron 130eq MD (motor drive), but the mount is already a bit too weak even without a camera attached.


For visual, a 6" or better 8" dobsonian will [show you the most](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622). For imaging, the CG4/NEQ3/[Astroview](http://www.telescope.com/Orion-AstroView-Equatorial-Telescope-Mount/p/9822.uts)-mount, a motor, and a good camera lens or small telescope will be your best option.

Of course you can take pictures through a manual telescope such as a dobsonian, but this basically limits you to bright objects (moon, planets, double stars) and it's pretty tedious with manual tracking through the finder.Zhumell z8 for visual (better accessories than the xt8 ... if it's in stock)

and a barn-door for imaging;

A telescope for $400 that both performs well for imaging (requiring a RIGID equatorial tracking mount) and visual (requiring a large aperture) is almost impossible.

What to expect visually; https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

As you can see a 8" will show a lot, visually. Even with a simple tracking/goto telescope (that have severe limits in this price range) the most money would go towards the mediocre electronics, leaving less for the actual optics.Indeed, visiting an astronomy society / club / meet-up is a good idea before spending so much money before knowing what's required.

"Making every photon count" might be a good book to get prior to buying things.It's not hard once you've throughly read the manual. There is a lot to consider though; Back-slash, leveling, aligning by driving to the objects from the same directions, using alignment targets ideally covering a larger "triangle" on the sky to get more accuracy, and so on... Oh, and the wonky behaviour when batteries run low.

The Celestron GoTo mounts are nice gadgets, but of course leave you with a smaller telescope than a manual dobsonian for example that's not hard to use either and simply shows more. The GoTo handset's manual took a while to digest, I've read simpler stargazing books! :-) But once you know the ins and outs, the GoTo mount is a great gizmo to use. Hello,

the different apertures and focal length make it hard to find "common ground", but here are a few suggestions.

For planets, you can go a bit higher, especially with the 114mm telescope;

Don't go under ~7mm  / over 180x with the 90mm Maksutov. More seems tempting but the image also gets darker. For deep-sky this doesn't make sense, the limit lies at 1mm exit pupil or so -&gt; &gt;=12mm eyepiece.

For the 114/900, 230x might be the "useful" limit, but don't push past 200x imho. Under 1mm exit pupil you don't really gain much. 

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png
.

Overview

Don't get a focal reducer for visual. That does not make much sense and can ad some vignetting. You can just get a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl that'll show the largest field of view on a 1.25" focuser. It costs $22.50 and nothing really is gained by the reducer due to the barrel/field stop.

.

Eyepiece type

At around F/13 &amp; F/8 almost every wide-angle eyepiece will perform great, at least regarding sharpness of the field. Just under F/6 there are noticeable differences.

The 66\u00b0 gold-line eyepieces are great budget eyepieces. I have gold-lines and for their low price they are awesome. Sure, 82\u00b0 eyepieces such as the ES, Luminos, Lacerta are great, but you'll need different eyepieces for the telescopes.

.

Possible eyepiece combinations

E.g. 7mm for the 90mm Mak, 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl could work well for both (or a ~24mm70\u00b0). A 2-3mm exit pupil (the light-beam exiting the eyepiece) is ideal for many deep sky objects (Exit pupil=eyepiece focal length divided by telescope aperture ratio).

So a 4.5mm HR Planetary, 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl and perhaps two of the  gold lines between 6-15mm could be the great for the 114/900.

The 15mm would be within your specified range and it's a decent eyepiece. At the lower magnification the 66\u00b0 is more than sufficient. Sure, more is nice.


For the 90mm Maksutov I mostly use a 8mm Planetary, 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl and 15mm Gold line.

So you could perhaps just buy the "free shipping" 15mm gold line and see how you like it.

.

Mount

Do you have a manual alt az mount, equatorial or even a motorized tracking mount? 

At high magnifications a very large apparent field of view is nice to have, but up to 200x it's not really required and ~70\u00b0 will be enough.

The 82\u00b0 ES are quite heavy, take it into consideration if your mount is already at it's limit.


.


Targets?

What telescope do you use most, and what for?

It depends a bit on what targets you observe when choosing eyepieces. A single 14mm82\u00b0 is a nice eyepiece, but for planets this can be a bit underwhelming (89/64x magnification for your two telescopes), but it's definitely a very nice mid-range eyepiece if you want to spend all money on a single eyepiece!

If you feel like you want more field of view, do get the 32mm Corvus Pl\u00f6ssl, it's cheap and decent if you can live with the 52\u00b0 afov. There's a 40mm Pl\u00f6ssl but the apparent field of view gets smaller, so not much is gained.

.

 IMHO three decent eyepieces go a long way, if they cover your main requirements (e.g. overview, planets, DSO). If you want to get a very good one and possible upgrade later, or give the cheaper 66\u00b0 eyepieces a try, is up to you in the end :-)
Want to see a terrible focusing system?

http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/amSkyluxTele_crop_display_large_preview_featured1.jpg

My \u20ac20 Tele-lens :-) ([Random link to the telescope](http://www.mygalaxy.de/skylux.html))The focal reducer will not work that way;

You will get some vignetting; Random links with photographic vignetting [1](http://stargazerslounge.com/topic/45104-focal-reducer-vignetting-normal-amount/) [2](http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/497327-stf-8300m-vignetting/)

I have a cheap 0.4x reducer and rarely use it.

The size of the barrel (and the Mak's field stop) will limit the True field.

I don't have the 82\u00b0 ep, but the Gold lines.Yeah, during the day it worked quite well with 1/1250s and something like ISO 400-800 to take images of seagulls and planes :-) But getting the focus right on the fly is tedious. Hello :-)

A 8" shows a lot (see the difference aperture makes [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)). A smaller aperture will limit what you can see, and for astro photography a sturdy mount is crucial, [you don't necessarily need a large telescope](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce).

The Skywatcher is the better deal (better optical finder, cheaper) but you will need a few acessories to get the most out of either, as - usually - kit eyepieces are basic.

The EQ3-2/NEQ3 is at it's limit with the 6" reflector. The focuser of reflectors on an equatorial mount  can wander to odd positions. The set-up and movement is not intuitive, but makes tracking a bit easier. Nothing you could not handle with a dobsonian and a decent wide-angle eyepiece.

How important is portability for you?

If the Arduino IDE is too confusing for him, you could try "Ardublock".Hello,

almost no Apps for the night sky require data service, you could still use them. For planets, you do not need a dark sky, and they do not move much during the course of a week. Just look up the position and times before hand in Stellarium (adjust the latitude/longitude setting). If you know the general direction, you'll find the brighter ones.

For planets, a small Makutov might be a better choice. For deepsky the little 3" is nice because of it's large maximum field of view,  but limited; 


Do you have binoculars? A book/guide? Or no interest in deep sky! :-)Thank you!

If you have any specific questions regarding your telescope purchase &amp; requirements, don't hesitate to post. :-)The dobsonian has 1200mm focal length, divided by a  6mm eyepiece = 200x magnification;

200x magnification will work most of the time (depending on the atmospheric seeing conditions more isn't always usable anyway).

The 15mm can be a great mid-range eyepiece for deep-sky (larger exit pupil, 80x magnification)

The cheap 30mm80\u00b0 has a few controversial reviews with a 8" dobonian (F/6). For &lt;$100 it's alright. The inner field's sharpness is comparable to the ~30mm70\u00b0 eyepieces with the added bonus of a bit more field of view. Both work and are a good upgrade to the 25mm 52\u00b0 kit eyepiece.Hello,

**Overview eyepiece**

Sadly the XT6 only has a 1.25" focuser AFAIK, so a wide-angle overview eyepiece is not really an option. A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl would show a little bit more (Difference similar to the first two images [here](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg)). There's also a 40mm Pl\u00f6ssl but the 1.25" limits the maximum field, it will just have a narrower apparent field of view.


.


**Planetary eyepiece:**

A 6mm eyepiece would give you 200x magnification, which is nice for planets :-) Don't get a cheap Pl\u00f6ssl though as the eye relief is short.


.


**Mid-range**

A ~15mm is a universal. The image won't be as dim as with the 6mm, and ideal for many clusters, nebulae and galaxies that don't require overly high magnifications anyway.

.

**Eyepiece type / recommendation**

As you did not mention a budget, but that the 8" was too expensive, consider these budget eyepieces: The "gold line". Basically the same as the "Orion Expanse" but cheaper. They have a 66\u00b0 wide angle apparent field of view while costing only slightly more than more simple eyepieces.

Cheaper eyepieces would be the Pl\u00f6ssl eyepieces. $17-$22.50 at Corvus optics, but they have a smaller apparent field of view (52\u00b0, also see [this](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AFOV_.png)) and the short ones have horrible eye relief.

Better eyepieces would be the Luminos or Explore Scientific with "ultra wide" 82\u00b0 afov... But they cost much more.

You'll read about Barlows a lot that double (or triple) the magnification. But especially the cheap ones will ad chromatic aberration and other issues. While it is nice to "double" every eyepiece's magnification, a dedicated wide-angle eyepiece will work much better than a budget barlow + mediocre kit eyepiece.

.

**What to observe**

Do you have a starting guide such as "Turn left at Orion" and a dim red light? It won't simply show you where to find objects (like an App would), but also what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, and what to expect. Also it preserves night-vision better than a back-lit display...

.

**TL;DR:** 

(32mm overview) + 15mm  wide angle (deep-sky) + 6mm wide angle (planets) is a decent palette. Gaps can be filled later.

Perhaps a cheap [moon filter](http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Neutral-Density-Transmission-Telescope-Eyepiece/dp/B01220Z2BW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449786640&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=moon+filter); It really depends on her interest, for planets the 6mm will be more fun :-)

The 6mm will already dim down the view of the moon as well, some can tolerate it then without moon filter. (The higher you magnify, the dimmer the image).

Do consider both eyepieces, at least in the long run :) Three good eyepieces can go a long way.Well, how much are you willing to spend? :-) The gold line cost $35 in the US, and $24-$30 from Aliexpress, shipped.

Who said that, where? Regarding the "gold line" or just any 6mm eyepiece?

I have the 6mm gold line and I'm happy with it. Other budget eyepieces are the TMB HR Planetary, but they have a smaller apparent field of view.A 40mm makes no sense on a 1.25" focuser, as a 40mm typically has around 40\u00b0, a 32mm will show about the same True field of view. :-)

Both show only a bit more than the 25mm kit eyepiece, so covering mid-range or high magnification might make more sense.Hello again :-)

That most likely addresses older eyepiece designs under 10mm due to short eye relief. Modern eyepieces have a longer eye relief. The gold line have a bit over 14mm, the TMB HR Planetaties over 15mm, some designs even 20mm. The 6mm is great for planets, especially if you can't afford an eyepiece that costs much more. Reading that you have a budget of $75, you could consider the 15mm and 6mm, which would give you three eyepieces and a decent starter palette for almost all eventualities :-)

 - kit 25mm 52\u00b0, 48x magnification, ~1\u00b0 True field of view (3.1mm exit pupil)

 - 15mm 66\u00b0, 80x, 0.8\u00b0 tfov, (1.8mm exit pupil)

 - 6mm 66\u00b0, 200x, ~0.32\u00b0 tfov, (0.7mm exit pupil)


If you don't want such a small exit pupil the 9mm would be an alternative, but for planets, moon and some small DSO (double stars, globular clusters), 200x &amp; 0.7mm exit pupil is fine IMHO.

Clear skies!
Great :-)This &amp; Hello :-)

The z8 has better accessories, and even if you get lost with a good finder and map, there are always Apps to locate targets. Like the intelliscope, the phone will tell you what way to point thanks to position/motion sensors... but even if you had to get a smartphone first, you can get a last-generation phone for $50 (and some deep red transparency sheet to preserve night vision better). Personally, I find maps &amp; manual finding not a big deal (once you got used to it), especially with the Telrad. Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus are hard to miss, just look up where they are at in Stellarium and you'll have no trouble finding them (as they appear as bright stars).

Eyepieces: z8 30mm wide angle kit eyepiece [for a better overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg), and the 6mm wide-angle eyepiece ([store-brand](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/)) for planets instead of a Barlow, 15mm for deep-sky, ideally.

Three decent eyepieces can go a long way and beat any overpriced eyepiece box kit with mediocre ones. Basically cover overview, mid-range/deep-sky and planets, and you're set for a long time.

A 6mm will provide you with 200x magnification; As you are interested in planets I'd get it right away. More is possible, but only if the planets stand high and the atmospheric seeing conditions are excellent (which is rarely the case)

.

"Turn left at Orion" and/or [Telrad](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif) &amp; Maps. Compared to an App TLAO will not only show you where to find objects, but how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, and what to expect.

.

The z8 has basically everything you need to get started. Perhaps add an adjustable height chair, e.g. a $20 ironing chair. And warm socks :-)

.


You could even get a 10" or so when not getting the Intelliscope;

.


Note that only three planets show noteworthy surface details (plus Venus' phases) and aren't always up; The moons of the planets will remain featureless dots as they are simply too small while being far away. So a telescope suited for some deep-sky observing is worth considering.


Can you see the milky way from your location (for deep-sky)?The force is strong in this droid.Very nice! Hello :-)

Yes, a reflector is the best bang for the buck but the image is upside-down. You can get [erecting eyepieces](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Newton-Reflecting-20mm-Erecting-Eyepiece-Erect-image-optics-For-All-standard-1-25-Reflecting-Telescopes/32345756552.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.43.4TYMwM&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_82_80_62,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1) and [erecting adapters](http://www.amazon.com/Telescope-1-5x-Erecting-Eyepiece-Diameter/dp/B00PQV5HFQ), but as they are rarely used (it does not matter if space is "upside-down") there are few choices and especially the adapters tend to be of poor quality.

Under $200 you will have MANY sets that are not good; Either on a weak tripod or with flawed optics. Short cheap refractors are not suited for high magnification; Short newtonian reflectors have their flaws, too.

.

GoScope: Short refractor has several flaws, despite the large aperture.

Starblast 4.5": Short reflector, the aperture ratio of F/4 will have several flaws.

70eq: Small refractor. Not bad, but it just lacks the aperture for many targets. Especially for terrestrial, the 70az would be better (and cheaper) than the  70EQ
  
.

Yes, aperture is key,  but portability plays a big role, too :-) 

Here is a link on what to expect in different smaller apertures and one link with more comparisons:

.


One option under $200 is the Celestron c90; You will need a (rigid) tripod and one or two more eyepieces, but these are fun for terrestrial viewing and super small. Maksutovs are short as they have a different design (optical path "bouncing" back and forth). 
 
For $200, you can get a 5" telescope though, or a 6" dobsonian for $275 if the main focus is space... And get some $35 binoculars or spotting scope for day-time (Celestron Cometron 7x50, or just something simple as  [this spotting scope](http://www.amazon.com/BARSKA-15-40x50-Colorado-Spotting-Scope/dp/B0049IZMUW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449845349&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=BARSKA+15-40x50) so you don't have to compromise regarding night-time observing!)

Here a few other suggestions;

 - [AWB Onesky](http://store.astronomerswithoutborders.org/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=5&amp;products_id=4&amp;zenid=k98f0rvoeu7os1qoc3t8sb23a7) - Great telescope for kids, but more than a toy. Low to the ground but far more rigid than all the weak sets on tripod in this price range; [It has a few quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew), but nothing you can't fix.

 - [90mm refractor](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-AstroView-90mm-Equatorial-Refractor-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/79024.uts?sortByColumnName=SortByPriceAscending) will show more than the typical 60, 70mm refractors in this price range; The tripod like in all of the cheaper sets aren't very rigid. 

 - [c90](http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-52268-C90-Mak-Spotting/dp/B0038QYRDO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449845544&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=c90), as discussed, sometimes cheaper; The down-side is mainly the small maximum field of view and a bit less contrast compared to the refractor, the up-side is the ultra compact size. 


 - If you insist on small size and day-time use, you can also get the c90 on a computerized table top mount for [$225](http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-virtuoso-90mm-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope). GoTo does not make everything necessarily easier (you will still need to know about the night-sky, and "Turn left at Orion" or "Simple stargazing" is an easier read than the Computer control's manual), but for the price difference, you could go that way.


 - [6" Dobsonian](http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6) - best bang for the buck (Except for the 8" which already shows the spiral structure of a bunch of galaxies...)

.


Eyepieces: It depends strongly on the choice of telescope. But you can get decent eyepieces for $20-$40, and there's no need to combine a cheap kit eyepiece with a cheap barlow. Stay away from overpriced eypiece box sets and zoom eyepieces (as they have a narrow apparent field of view on one side of the scale, but they can be nice for a day-time spotting scope). Two or three decent wide-angle eyepieces instead can go a long way.Hello! :-)

A 5" telescope is a great entry into the hobby! The mount is a bit small for the long telescope, don't extend the tripod fully, ad some weight to the center-plate perhaps. Some even fill the tripod legs with sand or replace them.

.

Anyway, to your first question: **Eyepieces**

Focal length of the telescope (900mm) divided by the eyepiece focal length equals magnification.

 - 900 / 10 = 90x

 - 900 / 25 = 36x

 - A 2x Barlow doubles the magnification, but especially the cheap ones reduces the contrast.


**Which ones to use**

You start with the lowest magnification, center your target, and witch to the higher magnification. For planets you need high magnifications, for many deep-sky objects you actually need lower magnifications.



The eyepiece kit should get you started. The 10mm+Barlow (if it's a 2x not a 3x) isn't an awesome combination, but it'll give you 180x and get's you started. For many deep-sky objects, lower magnification is more suited as the higher you magnify, the dimmer the image will get.

Also see http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png

There's a wide range of eyepiece types with wide-angle characteristics, better eye relief and for other magnifications. $20-$40 shipped internationally; http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AFOV_.png - yours have ~50\u00b0.

.

The small **optical finder scope** isn't great but it'll do it's job. Adjust it during the day using a very remote spot (mountain top for example), as far away as possible.

.


**Manual:** 

Random Google result: http://www.apm-telescopes.de/media/manuals/skywatcher/en/20.pdf 

Consider getting "Turn left at Orion" as telescope manuals only address the technical aspects; Apps are great for finding things but influence your night vision due to the back-lit display, and TLAO will show you how to observe, what's worthwhile observing and what to expect. The paper version is to be preferred, but you can also download a free PDF (IIRC).
Clear skies! Have fun with your telescope! Let us know how it goes and don't hesitate to ask more questions :-) Where are you located at by the way?
Yes, it's kind of counter-intuitive :-)

Don't hesitate to try during the day*, get used to the set-up. 

You can get the "gold line" and HR Planetary eyepieces at different places here in Europe for under 40/50\u20ac or at Aliexpress for \u20ac24-\u20ac30  / \u20ac35-\u20ac40 if you ever feel the urge to upgrade :-)

Do observe the Orion nebula as one of your first targets, it's a great starter object; Also see 

 - http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/winter.html

Do you have http://stellarium.org?

------

*
*Just avoid to point it at the sun at any cost without an appropriate sun filter (and covered finder!), as even a split-second will damage your eye permanently. (IF your telescope comes with [this eyepiece sun filter](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Sun-Optical-Filters-Astronomical-telescope-Sun-filter-1-25-inches-31-7mm-Metric-screw-thread/1942685131.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.142.RmSyHw&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_82_80_62,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1), do not use it, only [a brand name front filter](http://astrosolar.com/) is to be used)*
It's the distance between eye and eyepiece. Older, simpler eyepiece designs under 10mm focal length or so have a short eye relief.

https://starizona.com/acb/basics/equip_eyepieces_ler.aspx

E.g. a 4mm Pl\u00f6ssl eyepiece may sound tempting as it's so cheap, but the eye relief is something around 2mm, making it nearly impossible to use (you can't view the entire field of view, your eye lashes grease the lens and get in the way when observing).

This is why simpler eyepieces are combined with a Barlow. 

More modern eyepiece designs are available with constant eye relief no matter the focal length.Keep in mind Stellarium shows pretty pictures, visually, deep-sky objects look a bit different;

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622 - Look at the 4"-5" examples.

...but seeing them for yourself is still amazing! :-)

On a good night you can see the Cassini division in Saturn's rings, or Jupiter's moons, the shadow they cast on the planet, and the great red spot. Mars is tricky due to size/distance, and the others are pretty much feature-less.

Under dark skies you can even see a bit of structure in Galaxy M51 for example, hints of the spiral structure; M81/M82 or even M101 are other galaxies that are great to observe in a 5". A lot of individual stars in clusters such as M13 become visible (especially with indirect vision). A lot of double stars like Albireo can be resolved with small to medium telescopes and show nice color. The ring- and dumbbell nebulae are nice targets to practice on, too. Andromeda is always worth the disappointment :-) It's often a feature less oval under less ideal conditions. 


.

The moon will influence deep-sky observations as it's so bright :-) But it makes the first use easier than trying everything in the complete dark. 

Let your eyes adjust; It takes 20-30 minutes, while any light source (even a cellphone in night mode) can destroy it within a second :-) This is why paper maps + dim red lights are still so popular.

If you ever feel the urge to upgrade eyepieces, don't get a box set or zoom; Three *good* eyepieces go a long way :-) For now the ones you have will work just fine.



.


Oh, I forgot:

Eyesontheskydotcom has posted two video links in the [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2f0goy/for_anyone_posting_what_telescope_should_i_get/) on how to [align](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plx6XXDgf2E) and [use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7HVDKAZ6eM) an equatorial mount, as well on how to [align](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waPj5AkXirs) a finder scope.Hello :-)

A used telescope can be a real bargain, but there's a lot of junk on there as well. 

The 6" on Skyview EQ mount is OK, the mount not overly sturdy for the 6"; Plus  you can get a 6" dobsonian for around the same price, new. Also a 6" on such an EQ mount is not lighter.

I do not know the Meade set, but it's a reflector not a refractor (error in the description). The electronic eyepiece is probably not good, but there's just no information. The mount looks a bit under-dimensioned for a 114/900 telescope. The price of $150 is not bad if the mount works and carries the telescope rigid enough.

If you are handy, you can get a Celestron 114/900 for $50 on a weak EQ mount at CL right now, and build a sturdy rockerbox yourself.

There are also a few Nexstar GoTo mounts/telescopes, but the smaller one (114GT) despite the lower price isn't a great telescope.Despite the mount issue, a 130/900 is a great telescope and shows much more than most in this price range.

I have a bunch of these for school workshops (but built sturdy rockerboxes for $5 to increase the stability).

Make sure to take a look at Turn Left at Orion and you should be all set :-)Just send a second one to space/in orbit. Easy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOTpzyuPipk

http://www.wired.com/2013/02/kessel-run-12-parsecs/

SCNR!What's your budget, what do you plan on observing?

None of these really is a steal, so it depends on how quickly you want a new telescope :-)With wide-angle eyepieces and a goto mount it's not required; Especially with a optical finder scope. :-)

Many telescopes, especially the cheaper ones, come with a red dot finder, or people use a Telrad. If you put in an eyepiece to get 300x  magnification right away, it's unlikely to get the target into the field of view right away :-)

You don't need your lungs anyway, there's no oxygen* in space.

---

*Yes,  I am aware that the ISS is still affected by drag of the  residual atmosphere :-)The 6" would perform the best despite the mount not being ideal. If you aren't in a hurry, a 8" might show up for around $200. :-) Good luck!

Otherwise there's also the AWB Onesky; While not as good for high magnifications as the 114/900 or 130/900, it's small base is more rigid.

What to expect in different apertures, visually (Planets, nebulae, galaxies)

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622 
Calimero?

http://www.animaatjes.de/cliparts/calimero/This :-)

Otherwise hard to say, not knowing what OP already has. Multimeter, adjustable soldering station... Many basic tools.Hello,

the newtonian reflector telescopes that are much shorter than their specified focal length have a flawed/spherical mirror. There's an additional lens in the focuser extending the short focal length artificially. It's suppose to correct the spherical aberration of a short focal length spherical mirror. The telescopes are called bird-jones telescopes, it's a kind of catadiopter (combining lenses and mirrors). Typical bird-jones telescopes: 114/1000, 127/1000, 150/1400mm. In this price range they have several issues regarding contrast and collimation. The reason so many sets are bird-jones is because they are cheaper to produce and their short tube does not require a beefy mount. 

This brings us to the second problem: The EQ2 and especially EQ1 mount in many of these sets. Too weak, making focusing and tracking tedious. This might not sound or look like a big deal to beginners at first, but finding focus is anoying. 

Under $200, there are only a few options that are recommendable, but still with a small "but...".

For example:

- AWB Onesky (Skywatcher Heritage 130p outside of the US)

 - $199 at Astronomers without borders

 - Small, the largest you can fit into a large backpack, has a few quirks though

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew

- The Meade Polaris 130eq and Celestron Astromaster 130eq

 - 130mm aperture with "real"  650mm focal length, parabolic mirror

 - Basically like the AWB/130p, not perfect, but good all-rounder, especially for wide-field

 - The EQ2 is already not ideal even for these

- 114/900 and 130/900 on EQ2 are available too

 - The EQ2 is not ideal for these.

 - There's also the Celestron Powerseeker 114/900 for (sometimes) &lt;$100, but it's on EQ1. You can get these used for &lt;$50 and build a simple rockerbox with basic tools. That's what I did with students at a local school. 
 

- Celestron c90 Maksutov.  $145 or so

 - If you already have a rigid camera tripod, these make nice spotting scopes as well as compact travel telescopes. The 90mm aperture is a bit more limiting but it's still a lot of fun.

.
 
If you are willing to go over $200, there's a much better solution than ANY of the above: 

**The 6" dobsonians**


Aperture is key. See What to expect in different aperture telescopes: [LiNk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)




- e.g. the Skywatcher 150mm, as it's one of the few 6" with a large 2" focuser: http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6


.

If you can  increase your budget, and if you can transport it, the  8" dobsonians offer a lot more and can last a life-time;

The best two  are sadly out of stock

- z8, best accessories http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope

- Skywatcher was on sale, currently Cheapest http://www.amazon.com/SkyWatcher-S11610-Traditional-Dobsonian-8-Inch/dp/B00Z4G3PRK/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446370852&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=skywatcher+dobsonian

- The Orion xt8, ~$380, lack of a good 2" wide angle overview eyepiece (even the one in the deluxe set is not great) and other accessories, but it's still a good telescope.

 - Edit: Telescope.com has a 2nd/clearance/refurbished section, the xt8 was on there for $311 the other day, but stock comes and goes

Check if you can find one used :-) What area are you from?
  Oh, from Canada :-)

So Canadian dollars; 


.

**8"**

KWTelescope has the xt8 comparably cheap but over budget http://kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html (but costs as much as the smaller 6").

.


**~~127eq~~**The drop-out-of-the-hobby-o-scope

Please don't buy the bird-jones 127eq or any other of these. They just cause more trouble and the frustration can lead you right out of this nice hobby :-(

.

**102az**

For deep-sky (nebulae, galaxies) aperture is key. 4" already shows a bit but of course not as much as 5, 6 or even 8". Did you check out the links on what to expect visually? :-)



The Astromaster 102az is not bad and I would probably recommend it over the 127eq (again, please don't buy, there are threads such as ["I really hate my bird-jones and can't collimate it"](http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/479897-i-really-hate-my-bird-jones-and-cant-collimate-it-help/) for a reason).


**BUT** for the price of the 102az you can get a Skywatcher Heritage 130p AND a good additional eyepiece. Or a amazing used telescope (See further down).

 The 5" dobsonian will even make a nice secondary travel telescope after you buy a larger one in the future.

Or get the c90 as you still find use for it if you don't stay with the hobby  :-) Sadly it's more expensive over there (and here in Europe as well). [Strangely it's almost cheaper to get this](http://quarkyscience.ca/shop/virtuoso-mak90-90mm-3-5-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope/) than the telescope (cad$275) + tripod.



.

**Binoculars as entry level instrument**

Actually even binoculars will show you a bunch of galaxies and nebulae. Do you own some?

Even if not, they can be a great addition to view objects with larger apparent size. Their large field of view makes it easier to orient yourself, even in combination with a telescope. I found them very useful when trying to locate things with my telescope. Even cheap ones (Celestron Cometron 7x50 Binoculars $41cad) can be nice to have, but in the low budget range there's a lot of trash as well. Also, over 10x is not easy to hold free-handed when observing DSO, and depending on the light pollution you might choose some others with a smaller exit pupil (e.g. 6x30 or 10x50).


**The most important tool**

Make sure to grab a copy of "Turn left at Orion". Sure, there are Apps (e.g. Night sky tools) and great software such as http://Stellarium.org, but it will show you what to expect visually, what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, where to find it etc.

.

**Department store telescopes**

"Department store telescopes are a common term for garbage telescopes in astronomy forums.

There's a reason why no one recommends buying telescopes at *mart or *co.  The people responsible for the products they stock typically have no clue about telescopes and pick products that look like the stereotypic telescope and seem to have a good value/price. 

Pick a astronomy shop nearby or one with good on-line return policy if you really worry.

**Optics over mount?**

In my personal opinion, I would rather buy the Celestron 114/900 ("real" focal length) for CDN$ 179.99 (or a fragment, used!) before I'd get the bird-jones. The EQ1 is horrible for larger telescopes, but at leas the telescope is not, and one can still build a better mount for it. 

.

**Options not available or more expensive in Canada** :,-(

Strangely over there the SkyScanner 100 and similar cost as much as the Heritage 130p (while in the US they cost &lt;$100 &amp; $199).

The Heritage costs cad$267 over there, the XT4.5 $318 (too close to the 8" dobsonian IMO, weird! :-))

Also the c90 costs much more almost anywhere outside the US.

**Used**

Sure, lots of garbage, but you can frequently get telescopes for half their retail price. 


Used deals I spotted on the fly:

- SW 150/750 for cad$200:

 - http://montreal.craigslist.ca/tag/5251767647.html

 - Not perfect, but the mount does not suck (nEQ3 iirc) and 6" shows quite a bit! The F/5 aperture ratio has a few down-sides but it'll make a great telescope anyway, beating all those 4".

 - That's a good deal!

- 114/500

 - Only $35. That's what I would spend for any of the bird jones or very short focal length telescopes. Not $200+ new. They won't be good. But hey, $35.

 - http://maine.craigslist.org/for/5251744562.html


- 130/910 on EQ2

 - $200. Not as good as a deal as the first, but hey, there are worse telescope. The stability is borderline cringeworthy 

 - http://maine.craigslist.org/ele/5231259303.html



- 4" Goto Maksutov

 - $250. http://maine.craigslist.org/for/5226615214.html

 - Not bad, but the 150/750 will beat it in any regard. 

 - Computerized/GoTo is a nice gadget, but finding objects manually is not hard either. Especially those worthwhile observing in a 4". "Turn left at Orion" is easier to read than the GoTo handbook :-) And set-up for manual telescopes is shorter, too, of course. Also the cheaper GoTo mounts may not be pushed by hand, so batteries/power supply always required, if you're out of power, pack up &amp; go home.


If you search CL you will find a lot of similar offers; Right now  but further away there are 8" dobsonians for $200-$300, not unusual, e.g. http://burlington.craigslist.org/ele/5244473149.html


.

Keep in mind the resale value of a decent starter telescope is much better too. E.g. if you buy one at a very good price, you can resell it easily. Something  like the Powerseeker bird-jones sell up to $300 in-store, but sell for as low as $30-$50 used regularly. For a reason.  Of course they will show more than the naked eye, but as there are alternatives for the same price, avoid.

Great that you have the opportunity to test a old refractor :-) Do you know what kind? Refractors are great (but the required mount and price per aperture often make the larger ones pretty expensive).

I completely forgot to mention to look for a local astronomy meet-up/club/society or star-gazing event, as you can typically look through a few telescopes before purchasing anything (plus meet nice people and get free advice :-) ....though 3 telescope owners, 4 opinions! ;-) )

If that 150/750 eq refractor is anywhere near you, I would recommend to pick it up. It's worth over $800 new, and while not as big as a 8", really shows a lot.Hello,


unfortunately not all telescopes of the US sites are available in Canada, or at least not for that price. Kwtelescopes has the 8" the cheapest, even cheaper than in the US. At least via the link provided.

Did you look at the aperture comparison links? 3" is even smaller and will show a lot less. I started with a used telescope like that for less than 20 dollars. New it's overpriced. Also B. Is not known for their quality, at least with recent kits. The 3" with 700mm focal length is a classical newtonian, else it would be much shorter.

Good to hear of the local group, that'll help a lot :-)

Have fun!

This :-) The c90 is very affordable ($145) while the Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 computerized set strangely costs as much as the bare telescope from other companies.I agree with the whole rest, the only way to do astro photography in this budget is a (used) CG4/Astroview/NEQ3 mount (or similar) and a smaller 3-5" telescope (80mm refractor, 5"F/5 reflector) but it will limit [what you are able to see visually](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) greatly.

There's also the Nexstar SLT127, but it's not an equatorial mount (not suited for exposures over 20-30s) and the telescope is not ideal either (focal ratio). It's a nice telescope for the balcony to observe the planets though :-) Still, the 5" is the bottle-neck for visual.

For the same money you'll get a 8" or 10" dobsonian. While 5" will show most deep-sky objects as faint fuzzies, 8" and up can show you the spiral structure of some galaxies under dark skies. It also gives you amazing views of the planets. But as they aren't allways up to observe, and atmospheric seeing limits magnification,  deep-sky observation is always worth considering.

.

Buying a telescope for "everything"^TM will end in some bad compromise, especially on a budget. For visual, the largest aperture you can afford &amp; transport is key. For imaging, a rigid mount is much more important than a large telescope! In fact,  many commercial sets with bigger telescopes are not ideal for either, as the mount is a bit too weak to make the set cheaper, and to get into visual observing the thing will be a bit overwhelming at first.$23 Arduino starter Kit http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062

I can only imagine that they would have simple tasks (moon, Jupiter, double stars) which basically any telescope can do, no matter if $20 or $2000.

It might be a better idea to wait until it's actually required.



As mentioned, local astronomy clubs.

/u/mortomyces's suggestion is a good starter telescope, but it's really, really  hard to make a suggestion without a budget, what objects are observed the most, and so on.

/u/meowncy, tell us what area you are from, you can often get decent starter telescopes at Craigslist for far under $50. Something with enough aperture &amp; accessories to get stunning views of the moon and brighter DSO.

Also, do you own binoculars?Probably the Moon :-) Could be Venus?

Not much up there that would appear that large and bright for so long.

Also many overestimate the size of the moon. On a wide angle shot that's about right. Even with our eyes it's not as big as we think ("half a finger on arm's length" [[1]](http://www.starcorral.com/html/lost_in_space_-_2.html))

So while we perceive the moon like [a tele-lens/closeup/crop shot](http://www.artistrising.com/products/529559/toronto-skyline--moon.htm), also due to the [Moon-Illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion), it's actually more like [this](http://www.123rf.com/photo_4089672_wide-angle-view-of-road-at-dusk-showing-vehicle-headlights-and-taillights-with-blue-sky-and-moon-on-.html) ;-)

You often read things like "it's between" or "it's so close it's within the atmosphere" when reading U.F.O. reports, that's because our brains sometimes fail at judging sizes and distances without reference points, and even then, it's sometimes playing tricks on us.

Keep in mind that without knowing the camera lens focal length (...and chip size or crop factor) it's hard to tell how big the object actually appeared to be and if it could be the moon or not.Video astronomy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiCNmYdkaE

It's low resolution &amp; high noise.

While cameras HoeMuffin posted are available, astrovideo.co.uk and modified CCTV cameras (some starting as low as $30-$50 from china) can work well, too. 

Also see http://stargazerslounge.com/forum/123-video-astronomy/ for a place to specifically discuss video astronomy.

You will still need a good tracking mount and ideally a telescope with a shorter focal length as the crop factor of the camera sensors is pretty high.


"A small port" - Have you looked through a modern eyepiece? They have a long eye relief and 80-120\u00b0 apparent field of view (while some old/cheap kit eyepieces have 40\u00b0 and under 15mm eye relief).

Video astronomy may seem tempting for beginners, and it IS very neat. But you can't "zoom" unless swapping barlows and reducers, and it's low resolution. Plus there is some lag as the video frames are stacked to enhance the image.

For planets, you can basically pop in a $10 webcam / "usb eyepiece" but YMMV with the cheap solutions.


Visual observing might not be in full color and our eyes can't see very faint structures some cameras might reveal, but if you want pretty pictures check out Stellarium :-) Part of the hobby is the finding &amp; observing... Discovering more and more detail every time you observe an object. Seeing something with your own eyes is still something special :-) Plus it's cheaper to start visual astronomy. 

For VA it'll cost around $200-$400 for an equatorial tracking mount, $100 for a motor or more for a GoTo-set, $200-$400 for a telescope, $50-$xxx for the camera, perhaps motor focus, barlow, video-capture usb adapter and/or small 4-7" screen,...

For $200-$400 you can already get a rather big manual telescope capable of showing you nice views of the planets and also a bit of detail regarding deep-sky. For $30-$150 you get very nice wide-angle eyepieces as well.
Hello,

probably not a reply you where looking for, but have you considered a rockerbox or pipe-mount? Lot's of build-logs &amp; tutorials available, and perhaps you can adapt one idea or another. Tube rings, pipe end covers, ...Hi again :-)

Did  you have a chance to look at the mirror (corrosion, "too" clean, chipped)...? 

Will they let you try it out during the day?

For $149 it's a steal if it's in working order, even if it does not have a 2" focuser.Hello,

the basic functions could be achieved easily; Cheap as well if you order at Aliexpress, ebay, Bang Good or similar :-)

ESP8266 Wifi module (e.g. esp-01/esp-201, $2-$3) or Bluetooth-module (hc05 06)

2wd smart car chassis $8-10 at Aliexpress, $10 Banggood, $12-14 Amazon. There are also 4wd and chain versions.

A double H-Bridge (self built or as $1 module) for the motors.

Servos for the arms start at $1, though you might want more expensive / stronger ones, e.g. hobby metal gear servos (Hobbyking?)

Sub-$1 ultra sonic sensors can be used for obstacle avoiding, tcrt5000 and similar IR sensor modules to avoid falling down stairs or for following lines.

The obstacle avoiding robot is relatively easy and a good starting point in my experience. Wireless, servo arms and so on can be implemented bit by bit.

I have not used a 1sheeld before but it might be a neat board for this :-)This :-)

Otherwise hard to say, not knowing what OP already has. Multimeter, adjustable soldering station... Many basic tools.Hello,

the newtonian reflector telescopes that are much shorter than their specified focal length have a flawed/spherical mirror. There's an additional lens in the focuser extending the short focal length artificially. It's suppose to correct the spherical aberration of a short focal length spherical mirror. The telescopes are called bird-jones telescopes, it's a kind of catadiopter (combining lenses and mirrors). Typical bird-jones telescopes: 114/1000, 127/1000, 150/1400mm. In this price range they have several issues regarding contrast and collimation. The reason so many sets are bird-jones is because they are cheaper to produce and their short tube does not require a beefy mount. 

This brings us to the second problem: The EQ2 and especially EQ1 mount in many of these sets. Too weak, making focusing and tracking tedious. This might not sound or look like a big deal to beginners at first, but finding focus is anoying. 

Under $200, there are only a few options that are recommendable, but still with a small "but...".

For example:

- AWB Onesky (Skywatcher Heritage 130p outside of the US)

 - $199 at Astronomers without borders

 - Small, the largest you can fit into a large backpack, has a few quirks though

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew

- The Meade Polaris 130eq and Celestron Astromaster 130eq

 - 130mm aperture with "real"  650mm focal length, parabolic mirror

 - Basically like the AWB/130p, not perfect, but good all-rounder, especially for wide-field

 - The EQ2 is already not ideal even for these

- 114/900 and 130/900 on EQ2 are available too

 - The EQ2 is not ideal for these.

 - There's also the Celestron Powerseeker 114/900 for (sometimes) &lt;$100, but it's on EQ1. You can get these used for &lt;$50 and build a simple rockerbox with basic tools. That's what I did with students at a local school. 
 

- Celestron c90 Maksutov.  $145 or so

 - If you already have a rigid camera tripod, these make nice spotting scopes as well as compact travel telescopes. The 90mm aperture is a bit more limiting but it's still a lot of fun.

.
 
If you are willing to go over $200, there's a much better solution than ANY of the above: 

**The 6" dobsonians**


Aperture is key. See What to expect in different aperture telescopes: [LiNk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)




- e.g. the Skywatcher 150mm, as it's one of the few 6" with a large 2" focuser: http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6


.

If you can  increase your budget, and if you can transport it, the  8" dobsonians offer a lot more and can last a life-time;

The best two  are sadly out of stock

- z8, best accessories http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope

- Skywatcher was on sale, currently Cheapest http://www.amazon.com/SkyWatcher-S11610-Traditional-Dobsonian-8-Inch/dp/B00Z4G3PRK/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446370852&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=skywatcher+dobsonian

- The Orion xt8, ~$380, lack of a good 2" wide angle overview eyepiece (even the one in the deluxe set is not great) and other accessories, but it's still a good telescope.

 - Edit: Telescope.com has a 2nd/clearance/refurbished section, the xt8 was on there for $311 the other day, but stock comes and goes

Check if you can find one used :-) What area are you from?
  Oh, from Canada :-)

So Canadian dollars; 


.

**8"**

KWTelescope has the xt8 comparably cheap but over budget http://kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html (but costs as much as the smaller 6").

.


**~~127eq~~**The drop-out-of-the-hobby-o-scope

Please don't buy the bird-jones 127eq or any other of these. They just cause more trouble and the frustration can lead you right out of this nice hobby :-(

.

**102az**

For deep-sky (nebulae, galaxies) aperture is key. 4" already shows a bit but of course not as much as 5, 6 or even 8". Did you check out the links on what to expect visually? :-)



The Astromaster 102az is not bad and I would probably recommend it over the 127eq (again, please don't buy, there are threads such as ["I really hate my bird-jones and can't collimate it"](http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/479897-i-really-hate-my-bird-jones-and-cant-collimate-it-help/) for a reason).


**BUT** for the price of the 102az you can get a Skywatcher Heritage 130p AND a good additional eyepiece. Or a amazing used telescope (See further down).

 The 5" dobsonian will even make a nice secondary travel telescope after you buy a larger one in the future.

Or get the c90 as you still find use for it if you don't stay with the hobby  :-) Sadly it's more expensive over there (and here in Europe as well). [Strangely it's almost cheaper to get this](http://quarkyscience.ca/shop/virtuoso-mak90-90mm-3-5-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope/) than the telescope (cad$275) + tripod.



.

**Binoculars as entry level instrument**

Actually even binoculars will show you a bunch of galaxies and nebulae. Do you own some?

Even if not, they can be a great addition to view objects with larger apparent size. Their large field of view makes it easier to orient yourself, even in combination with a telescope. I found them very useful when trying to locate things with my telescope. Even cheap ones (Celestron Cometron 7x50 Binoculars $41cad) can be nice to have, but in the low budget range there's a lot of trash as well. Also, over 10x is not easy to hold free-handed when observing DSO, and depending on the light pollution you might choose some others with a smaller exit pupil (e.g. 6x30 or 10x50).


**The most important tool**

Make sure to grab a copy of "Turn left at Orion". Sure, there are Apps (e.g. Night sky tools) and great software such as http://Stellarium.org, but it will show you what to expect visually, what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, where to find it etc.

.

**Department store telescopes**

"Department store telescopes are a common term for garbage telescopes in astronomy forums.

There's a reason why no one recommends buying telescopes at *mart or *co.  The people responsible for the products they stock typically have no clue about telescopes and pick products that look like the stereotypic telescope and seem to have a good value/price. 

Pick a astronomy shop nearby or one with good on-line return policy if you really worry. 


.

**Optics over mount?**

In my personal opinion, I would rather buy the Celestron 114/900 ("real" focal length) for CDN$ 179.99 (or a fragment, used!) before I'd get the bird-jones. The EQ1 is horrible for larger telescopes, but at leas the telescope is not, and one can still build a better mount for it.

It also gives you amazing views of the planets. But as they aren't allways up to observe, and atmospheric seeing limits magnification,  deep-sky observation is always worth considering.

Buying a telescope for "everything"^TM will end in some bad compromise, especially on a budget. For visual, the largest aperture you can afford &amp; transport is key. For imaging, a rigid mount is much more important than a large telescope! In fact,  many commercial sets with bigger telescopes are not ideal for either, as the mount is a bit too weak to make the set cheaper, and to get into visual observing the thing will be a bit overwhelming at first.$23 Arduino starter Kit http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062

I can only imagine that they would have simple tasks (moon, Jupiter, double stars) which basically any telescope can do, no matter if $20 or $2000.

It might be a better idea to wait until it's actually required.



As mentioned, local astronomy clubs.

/u/mortomyces's suggestion is a good starter telescope, but it's really, really  hard to make a suggestion without a budget, what objects are observed the most, and so on.

/u/meowncy, tell us what area you are from, you can often get decent starter telescopes at Craigslist for far under $50. Something with enough aperture &amp; accessories to get stunning views of the moon and brighter DSO.

Also, do you own binoculars?Probably the Moon :-) Could be Venus?

Not much up there that would appear that large and bright for so long.

Also many overestimate the size of the moon. On a wide angle shot that's about right. Even with our eyes it's not as big as we think ("half a finger on arm's length" [[1]](http://www.starcorral.com/html/lost_in_space_-_2.html))

So while we perceive the moon like [a tele-lens/closeup/crop shot](http://www.artistrising.com/products/529559/toronto-skyline--moon.htm), also due to the [Moon-Illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion), it's actually more like [this](http://www.123rf.com/photo_4089672_wide-angle-view-of-road-at-dusk-showing-vehicle-headlights-and-taillights-with-blue-sky-and-moon-on-.html) ;-)

You often read things like "it's between" or "it's so close it's within the atmosphere" when reading U.F.O. reports, that's because our brains sometimes fail at judging sizes and distances without reference points, and even then, it's sometimes playing tricks on us.

Keep in mind that without knowing the camera lens focal length (...and chip size or crop factor) it's hard to tell how big the object actually appeared to be and if it could be the moon or not.Video astronomy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiCNmYdkaE

It's low resolution &amp; high noise.

While cameras HoeMuffin posted are available, astrovideo.co.uk and modified CCTV cameras (some starting as low as $30-$50 from china) can work well, too. 

Also see http://stargazerslounge.com/forum/123-video-astronomy/ for a place to specifically discuss video astronomy.

You will still need a good tracking mount and ideally a telescope with a shorter focal length as the crop factor of the camera sensors is pretty high.


"A small port" - Have you looked through a modern eyepiece? They have a long eye relief and 80-120\u00b0 apparent field of view (while some old/cheap kit eyepieces have 40\u00b0 and under 15mm eye relief).

Video astronomy may seem tempting for beginners, and it IS very neat. But you can't "zoom" unless swapping barlows and reducers, and it's low resolution. Plus there is some lag as the video frames are stacked to enhance the image.

For planets, you can basically pop in a $10 webcam / "usb eyepiece" but YMMV with the cheap solutions.


Visual observing might not be in full color and our eyes can't see very faint structures some cameras might reveal, but if you want pretty pictures check out Stellarium :-) Part of the hobby is the finding &amp; observing... Discovering more and more detail every time you observe an object. Seeing something with your own eyes is still something special :-) Plus it's cheaper to start visual astronomy. 

For VA it'll cost around $200-$400 for an equatorial tracking mount, $100 for a motor or more for a GoTo-set, $200-$400 for a telescope, $50-$xxx for the camera, perhaps motor focus, barlow, video-capture usb adapter and/or small 4-7" screen,...

For $200-$400 you can already get a rather big manual telescope capable of showing you nice views of the planets and also a bit of detail regarding deep-sky. For $30-$150 you get very nice wide-angle eyepieces as well.
Hello,

probably not a reply you where looking for, but have you considered a rockerbox or pipe-mount? Lot's of build-logs &amp; tutorials available, and perhaps you can adapt one idea or another. Tube rings, pipe end covers, ...Hi again :-)

Did  you have a chance to look at the mirror (corrosion, "too" clean, chipped)...? 

Will they let you try it out during the day?

For $149 it's a steal if it's in working order, even if it does not have a 2" focuser.Hello,

the basic functions could be achieved easily; Cheap as well if you order at Aliexpress, ebay, Bang Good or similar :-)

ESP8266 Wifi module (e.g. esp-01/esp-201, $2-$3) or Bluetooth-module (hc05 06)

2wd smart car chassis $8-10 at Aliexpress, $10 Banggood, $12-14 Amazon. There are also 4wd and chain versions.

A double H-Bridge (self built or as $1 module) for the motors.

Servos for the arms start at $1, though you might want more expensive / stronger ones, e.g. hobby metal gear servos (Hobbyking?)

Sub-$1 ultra sonic sensors can be used for obstacle avoiding, tcrt5000 and similar IR sensor modules to avoid falling down stairs or for following lines.

The obstacle avoiding robot is relatively easy and a good starting point in my experience. Wireless, servo arms and so on can be implemented bit by bit.

I have not used a 1sheeld before but it might be a neat board for this :-)Glad it helped you a bit :-)

For a 8", the dobsonian rockerbox is one of the easier (and cheaper) solution though.

Good luck with your project! Let us know how it works out :-)

There are also many A(mateur)T(telescope)M(aking) resources, build-logs and communities, e.g.

 - https://stellafane.org/tm/atm/

 - http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/tm.html

 - http://www.starastronomy.org/telescope-making/telescope-making-links-designs-and-techniques

Which can be a source of inspiration &amp; problem solving.What /u/orlet said :-)

You read some stories once in a while... Not only from beginners but in general; People using glass cleaner or even cooker(vitroceramic) cleaner which can contain grains/microscopic beads... Or simply other things causing tiny, tiny scratches and/or rubbing off the delicate coatings (first surface mirror, protective coatings), which results in more problems than dust ever would.

Mirrors do require cleaning, especially when there's grease, pollen or other gunk that's either aggressive or will decrease it's performance, but there are "contact-less"/"wet" cleaning methods.

Never touch a running system! ;-)This! :-)

But hey, at $150, I'd buy it.Very effective!

A 3.5"/90mm telescope is nice but not great for deep-sky. [There you will find several links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) on what to expect in different apertures.

Skip the barlow. These days you can get good eyepieces for $20-$45 that perform much better than pairing a cheap kit eyepiece and a lower budget barlow. For planets, light pollution isn't really an issue. 

[Random video on  a 8" dobonian size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJGKUjVaHzY), and [collage from Astropete](http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html); It will typically fit on the back-seat.Hello :-) Glad I could help.

The z8 includes a 2" wide angle eyepiece (a $70 value) that shows a larger field of view (See [this](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg)).

The z8 has a "dual speed" 1:10 focuser, meaning it's easier and more smooth to find focus.
 
The z8 also has a few other benefits over the Skywatcher or Orion 8" such as the finder and collimation tool.

Did you check out the first link in my reply that compares what to expect visually in different apertures?

It strongly depends on the conditions, experience and targets, but [this](http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/visastro/m51-apert/index.html), [that](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.binoviewer.at%2Fbeobachtungspraxis%2Fteleskopvergleich_deepsky.htm&amp;sandbox=1) and [this](http://www.deepskywatch.com/Articles/what-can-i-see-through-telescope.html) are pretty accurate. 

These are simulations and drawings, and it requires good condition (calm atmospheric seeing and/or dark sky) and time. The benefits of refractors are sometimes exaggerated IMHO.

You may be expecting colorful images as seen on-line or on TV, but our eyes are not capable of showing what cameras can with long exposures &amp; heavy editing. But you can still see a lot, and seeing all the objects with your own eyes is something amazing that no image can give you. :-)


"Turn left at Orion" and even some cheap binoculars (Celestron Cometron 7x50 $35 for example) is an ideal combination. The book will not only show you where to find things, but how to observe and what to expect. Together with a dim red light your night-vision is preserved better than with http://stellarium.org or Night sky tools (Android). Even together with a telescope the large field of view with binoculars and intuitive use make them great tools in case you have trouble locating something.That's so awesome :-) Thank you for sharing.Hello :-)

Usually binoculars are specified as Magnification X Aperture, but 68x is pretty crazy, especially free-handed :-) Especially cheap Chinese binoculars often have bogus numbers on them.

A 17\u00b0 field of view would mean that it's   very low power binoculars on the other hand. Something like 4x magnification with wide-angle eyepieces.

If you can't focus, they are probably not of much use. Can you use them during the day? Does it look like much magnification?

If you don't have astigmatism you can use any binoculars without glasses and correct via focus.

For as low as $35 you can get the Celestron Cometron 7x50. Those are not the best, but still very nice for star-gazing. 7x magnification is easy to hold free-handed, over 10x it's not easy to hold comfortable over a longer period of time.

Consider buying "Turn left at Orion"; Compared to an App such as Night Sky Tools or http://Stellarium.org it'll preserve your night vision better (when used with a dim red light), which is mandatory for observing faint deep sky objects.

Stars will remain dots when in focus (too far away even for large telescopes). Never look at the sun with them, instant &amp; permanent damage of your eyes.
Indeed, a 3-5" Mak is very portable (the design costs a bit more though).  I too use my 5" telescope more frequently than my larger one, but still, the difference is magnificent. Hello,

the blink program will work as soon as it has power which is independent from recognition.

. 
Seems to be all there from what I can see. :-)

At $150 it still seems to be a good deal. 

Not sure about that focuser but it should be possible to adjust the tension or ad some ptfe tape for example.Hello,

yeah, sounds like the numbers do not make sense and the focus issues limit it's use :-(

Field of view-&gt; A larger overview, but less magnification.

360\u00b0 would be all around. The moon is 0.5\u00b0 wide. [A lot of objects have an apparent size larger than the moon](http://calgary.rasc.ca/bigthings.htm) :-)

Not only a lower magnification will show a wider field of view, but there are also wide-angle eyepieces (e.g. a cheap 8x50 might not show as much as a high-end 8x50).

Some objects are huge, some smaller. So both can be nice to have, e.g. a light-weight 6x30 or a 15x70 for some other cases. More magnification does not necessarily mean better.

But the exit pupil also plays a role, and here it's a bit [c](http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/13)o[m](http://www.binocularsreviewed.net/the-exit-pupil/)plica[t](http://www.birdwatching.com/optics/education/light-to-the-eye.html)ed. It's basically the light beam diameter exiting the eyepiece. It should not be larger than your dilated pupil, which especially is an issue if there is light pollution. Low power binoculars with large aperture, such as the 7x50 are best used under dark locations. 10x50 are nice for the city limits, but 10x can't be held comfortably free-handed over a longer period of time for some.

Over 10x a tripod/monopod will be required to hold it steady and makes observing easier. Few can hold 12x or more steadily.

So it's a matter of how bright the image is, how much magnification is required &amp; can be held easily, and how large the aperture is. A larger aperture shows more, as with telescopes, but you can't have a huge 70mm aperture and just 4x magnification. And  20x magnification with a 20mm binoculars would be rather dim.
Hello :-)

You can even observe changes more frequently, e.g. the movement of Jupiter's moons or the moving surface; [Time lapse](http://www.birdwatching.com/optics/education/light-to-the-eye.html) (Under 3 hours) 

There are also stars with [variable brightness](http://www.asnsw.com/node/719), [this](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/22/runaway-star-2/#.Vju29yvsrIU), or once in a while comets to track :-)

Pluto is tricky, it's small and basically will appear as moving star. 

Our angle of view on the rings of Saturn change; [Montage, 6 years](http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/6yearsofsaturn.html).

Also you can observe Mars and it's ice caps &amp; apparent size, [e.g. this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hubble-heritage/3195427662).

There are recent changes (e.g. the [shrinking](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/15may_grs/) red great spot of Jupiter)

Of course some of these are only possible when the planets are visible &amp; high enough. Mars can be a toughy depending on the distance(apparent size) and position.

Lots of things have been discovered but it's still nice to see the gears of the sky turn ;-) I try to sketch my observations. Might not be fancy images, but it's nice to be able to go through them after a while.

Planets are easily found and with a smooth mount &amp; wide-angle eyepiece tracking and observing isn't an issue, especially as atmospheric seeing limits the maximum magnification anyway. For example, a computerized 5" costs as much as a manual 8", which will show much more-&gt; [What to expect in different apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

In some cases something like the Celestron Nexstar SLT127 can be very nice, it's not a bad deal at all, but especially for deep-sky, a 8" will show so much more (and the planets aren't observable all the time).

Also check out http://stellarium.org for some virtual attempts :-) It's a great free program.Hi :-)

 It's difficult as it depends on atmospheric seeing condition, adjustment/night vision, light pollution, experience, and how long you observe to carve out more and more faint details :-) E.g. at first glimpse a nebula might appear as smudge, but after you observe with different eyepieces you might perceive some structure you didn't notice at first. Our eyes can not stack or do long exposures, but will pick up more details after a bit.

And of course aperture.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

As for imaging, tracking is the most crucial part for long exposures. Even 18-200mm camera lenses can take great images (with some stacking/editing of course). [Example](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY)

While visual might not look as spectacular, it's still amazing to see those things with your own eyes. If you enjoy the views even in small telescopes or in binoculars (e.g. $35 Celestron Cometron 7x50 *AND* "Turn left at Orion") you will be very happy with a telescope for visual use.

.

Imaging looks more amazing on-screen, sure. But it's more work than one would imagine at first. "Making every photon count" should be your first purchase ;-) If you already have a camera, you can do a lot with just a tripod;  https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce


.

There's also Video Astronomy, that's "almost" live. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiCNmYdkaE 

It will still require tracking, is very low resolution &amp; very high noise, but great for outreach.This! :) Depends on the kind, though.

BUT kids will try to put something in the projection path, most of the time their head, so use Baader Solar film instead... :-)

Built telescopes with them. $1 Reading glasses, paper, eyepiece. http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/lesebrillen-teleskop/

For shorter FL eyepieces use a shorter FL glasses, e.g.:


1 divided by 1.5 diopters  = 0.666m = 666mm focal length, 40mm eyepiece = ~ 17x magnification

1 / 3dpt = 0.333m, 10mm eyepiece, 33x....

Depending on the reading glasses you might only be able to use 5x magnification or over 30x. Trial and error :-) The cheap rimless $0.50 kind didn't work at all for me.


Hello! :-)

Yes! ;-)

It's not too expensive: A Arduino clone starts at $2-$3, and you can get large kits like this one:

Port on the mount-&gt; Yes, it's typically so you can let Stellarium, Cartes du ceil or other programs control the mount.

For some mounts there are solutions to use third party software and track satellites like the ISS for example.

.

Mount/Motor-&gt; No clue about replacement parts, sorry.

.

What to expect in different apertures-&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

 Visually will be different than with long exposures &amp; stacked images, especially for deep-sky. 

Mars is more tricky than Saturn or Jupiter. It appears pretty small, depending on the current distance to us, and atmospheric seeing limits magnification. So sometimes it may just look like [this](http://radio-weblogs.com/0101365/stories/2003/10/13/marsOppositionOf2003.html). 

.

If you have a larger group an only one telescope, you can get "digital eyepieces" that are basically webcams without a lens that fit into the telescope's focuser. Or you can modify existing webcams. These things start at $10 or so at Aliexpress, but YMMV with the cheaper ones.

For deep-sky you ideally need an equatorial tracking mount, a "faster" focal ratio, and a camera capable of either taking long exposures (DSLR) or a special deep-sky camera that stacks "on the fly". The latter can be accomplished with $30-$150 (modified) CCTV cameras (and either a small screen or usb video capture stick) but is pretty low resolution &amp; high noise. Video astronomy:

The big advantage to DSLR shots is that it's live.

It's a good telescope and even without a motorized mount a lot is possible :-) I hope you can get it to work / replacements, or find a good, cheap used mount (either the same or something like a (H)EQ5, 6, though these beefy mounts might cost as much as two nice telescopes).Good luck with your projects :-)

It's pretty easy to get into and a lot of fun, as you see results so fast.

I've dabbled with microcontrollers before, but Arduino made it so much simpler. I'm building little robots for $15 or so with students now, and it's a blast.

You don't have to re-invent the wheel, but it can be a nice tool to customize solutions for your problems, e.g. controlling lights at home or just experimenting with different components such as the ESP Wifi modules.Hello,

you can do collimation during the day, and even if you don't get it spot-on, you will still see a lot (just with reduced contrast at high magnifications). It really sounds much more complicated on paper. After a few times you will realize you basically just look through &amp; center everything :-)

.

Tips: Don't try to find too much &amp; print/use a map/book :-) Remember that especially with the faint DSO a backlit screen will influence your night vision compared to paper+dim deep red light.

Binoculars, if avl.

The Orion nebula &amp; plejads will be the easy targets and a lot of fun. Take a look in Stellarium with your location set up to see how far they are up in the horizon. TLAO has good suggestions on what is visible &amp; worthwhile observing, while plain maps usually just show everything there is.

Dew shield: Yes, that'll work, but of course foam or something would be more durable. Just don't wipe the mirror and keep your eyepieces in your pocket (/w dustcap).

.

Handle-&gt; Sorry to hear. Send them a complaint. But yes, the handles on many dobsonians are pretty awkwardly placed/designed. 


Have fun, clear skies! :-)Hello,

I am not sure what it would cost to build something like this, but you can get GSM trackers for $13 or so (enough for a distance estimate if supported by the provider) or a GPS&amp;GSM Tracker for &lt;$30. 

Suplying power via the Dynamo is straight forward, I've seen a couple of projects, even in a local computer magazine.&gt; Bonus points: Can anyone tell me if/what the significance of being able to see this planet is?

You saw it! ;-) Many don't even realize what it is. My SO's dad once pointed up and said, "that's the brightest, it's the north star!" - It was Jupiter.

If you have binoculars laying around you can see it's moons; And the color of Mars. Saturn will be tricky until you get to around 30x magnification, then it's rings will get pretty obvious.


Also check out http://stellarium.orgVery pretty!Hello,

could you post a link to the comic?Hello,

9v batteries are low capacity, low current. They typically cause trouble when powering things like motor, e.g. it's working at first but suddenly you have random issues.

As for the different motor behavior: You are using different   speed for each motor?

Also, swap motors to see what happens to debug your wiring &amp; code.Yeah, sometimes it's just the wiring/pin order :-) Glad you got it sorted out!Current will be something to keep in mind.  The ULN boards can not handle high currents. 

How about a NEMA17 &amp; A4988 stepper driver for example?

Or get something like the Ramps or Melzi board ($12/$31) for a all-in-one solution :-)Hello :-) 

Depends on what you are shooting for, RaspberryPi being more sort of a "little" computer for complex tasks, the Arduino a microcontroller platform.

I currently build robots with students (7th/8th grade) again; It's fun, low cost ($15 or so) and you get results fast.

Do you have any hobbies? Often you can combine your hobbies to make fun stuff :-) Plant watering, home automation, time-lapse or tracking mounts for cameras...


Also look at different Kits and tutorials and see if you get some ideas on what to build :-) Or check out what's new at http://instructables.com.

Basically the Arduino is cheap ($1.70-$2.70) and has several inputs and outputs for lights, buttons, sensors.

[Kit](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062), [Parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874), Tutorials;

) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) [5](http://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-free-book-for-beginners/). 

The rPi is better for complex projects, e.g. using a screen, e.g. image recognition, basically running a complete operating system.You can get  [these](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Tracing-car-box-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Send-the-Battery-Box-For/32291913537.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.266.NZZHd4&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9) for $8-10 at Aliexpress/Banggood/ebay.

Basically we use a [ultrasonic distance sensor](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Ultrasonic-Module-HC-SR04-Distance-Measuring-Transducer-Sensor/1979768585.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.vOxAod&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9), a sub-$3 Arduino clone, a [double H bridge motor driver](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/J34-Free-Shipping-L9110S-Dual-DC-Stepper-Motor-Driver-Controller-Module-PWM-H-Bridge-for-Arduino/32397946051.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.34.FqKz6D&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9) and a $0.30 boost supply for the Arduino.

With 10 lines of code or 6 Ardublock-blocks (graphical UI) we have a very basic obstacle avoiding robot (if distance &lt; 60cm stop one motor for 1s to drive a curve).

From there they can improve on it, e.g. panning the sensor with a servo to determine which way to go, or driving reverse to back-up, or adding more sensors/gimicks such as the 8 cent TCRT5000 line/bottom sensor :-)

Later a ESP wifi module ($1.70-2.70) that's also a microcontroller, so it could be used stand-alone. That thing alone is pretty amazing, and I am going to build remote controlled boat &amp; tiny sail planes with them. I was going to use standard RC parts, but them being able to use their cellphone as remote just saves so much work and money (which we don't have, I am buying most of the parts myself for the projects there).

It's so simple but a lot of fun. The introduction to electronics and micro-controllers is a lot less boring if your project starts moving right away. ;-)

Still, the Arduino is something different for once. I've programmed a lot before, but getting a micro-controller to do something is fun, and it's ideal for some real-time tasks. Also a rPi would be overkill for some tasks.

.

rPi is great for something like a small emulator box/station or arcade machine. There are some Arduino games (I have a [Gamebuino](http://gamebuino.com/), it's a lot of fun), but they are limited.

Hello :-)

Using millis() / Blinkwithoutdelay will work fine. Interrupts are very useful to guarantee time critical inputs won't be missed. For a button press while blinking it's not mandatory.


A quick &amp; dirty solution to reset the blink speed would be

   ... 

    void loop() {
    
     if ( digitalRead(6) ) { interval=1000; } //Reset the interval length
   
     
      if (millis() - previousMillis &gt;= interval) 
      {
    previousMillis = millis();
    
 
    /*new*/ if (interval&gt;250) {interval-=50;}
    
    digitalWrite(13, !(digitalRead(13)) ); //quick and dirty state invert
     
      }
    }
   ...Just use as-is then :-) Dew heater is another option.

Too bad you can't see Orion, it's really THE object to view right now! :-)

Things rise east and set west, a location where you can also   view to the south is ideal.

Light-&gt; Well, if all fails, use your cellphone. But probably one of the apps that make your screen darker or tint it red :-)What /u/Orlet said, a 5" Mak, or the Heritage 130p. It has a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but it's a nice telescope. It shows more than the 4" Mak.

The Orion Starblast 6 might work with a large backpack, too.Did you contact the creator of that one?

You could also use RFID tags :-)
 

You will also find several methods to measure weight [1](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=18768.0) [2](http://uk.farnell.com/bi-technologies-tt-electronics/404r5kl1-0/linear-motion-control/dp/1330291) [3](http://gadgetmakersblog.com/hacking-kitchen-scale/)

Basically you will need a sketch that measures the weight (or identify an object via RFID tag) and uses variables and the time (millis()) to trigger an event if the weight difference is too great over a longer period of time. Be aware of the limitations. The simple USB eyepieces are not sensitive enough for nebulae, and you can not zoom in, limited to the telescope's focal length unless using a barlow, which will ad chromatic aberration if it's a lower budget one)The Meade and Skywatcher collapsible don't make too much sense as they are not really lighter, some models are even heavier, and the open truss will have disadvantages. A solid 8" will fit in most cars (tube on the back-seat) and 10kg/22lbs for each the base and tube is still not too difficult to handle.

The collapsible really just make sense when there are tight space constrains.

- [Starblast 6](http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-starblast-6-astro-reflector-telescope.html)

 - Oddly, not much more expensive in Canada than the 130p

 - Also available as "i", which stands for incredibly expensive gizmo.

 - Size: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H83qfFY41VE) / [2](http://umich.edu/~lowbrows/reflections/2008/mkurylo.3.html)

 - Do not underestimate the size and weight if you have to walk over a mile with all the stuff. I find the Heritage to be at the limit what I like to pick up and walk to a nearby field. I also have a ultra-light 10" truss telescope ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/sum1.jpg) [2](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/sum2.jpg)) but it's more of a hassle (and more expensive). Just because you see product shots of people carying them around like [this large 6" dobsonian](http://nimax-img.de/Produktbilder/normal/45034_5/Orion-Dobson-Teleskop-N-150-1200-SkyQuest-XT6-Plus-DOB.jpg) (Image:Astroshop), you really don't want to do that :-) Carrying the much smaller but still bulky Heritage with just the handle over a mile is horrible.

The above are table-top telescopes. I can use the 130p without a table, but especially taller people will find it very uncomfortable. A small box or stand (or Ikea Bekv\u00e4m) can take care of that.

A telescope with a tripod or a larger dobsonian are easier to use on the field, but even then standing will give you a backache and you will need to carry a small chair around. Plus a *rigid* tripod will be more bulky/heaver than a dobsonian overall, at least for a telescope of the same size.

.


The Maksutovs are very compact telescopes and the 3" or 4" fit into a small backpack, and you can just take a small (but stable) camera tripod along. The 3" will show significantly less than the 5" though. The 4" is a nice compromise, does still show a bit less in some cases though. 

Sadly the Maks are a bit more expensive outside the US. Also the Maks show a smaller field of view, while the shorter reflectors are also great wide-field telescopes.

The Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 is a steal in the US, as the  set costs as much as the bare telescope from other manufacturers. 

The Nexstar SLT GoTo mount is a nice gadget and you could fit it into a large tracking backpack.

For size: http://www.celestronimages.com/details.php?image_id=13549

The Maks also make great daytime spotting scopes! :-)



.

Do check the actual size before purchasing anything. Especially if you are tempted to go with the Starblast 6. All the pictures in the world won't give you a accurate impression. The 130p was already much larger than I had thought when it finally arrived at my door steps. 

.

As mentioned, binoculars are great tools. Even cheaper ones show a lot!

The larger your set-up, the less you will use it. Many nights, especially after work, you just feel like looking up half an hour or so, and if you need to pack things and carry them downstairs, you might tell yourself you'll do it another night.

Having something small like binoculars or a Mak will be more convenient.

.

[What to expect in different telescope apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)Hello :-)

It's basically just an advantage if you need to store your telescope or it's mandatory you fit it into a small trunk as the back-seat will be used by kids :-)

No ;-) The only advantages of the Skywatcher/Meade truss-designs is the smaller packing volume.  The Skywatcher 10" also just has F/4.7 which will require good eyepieces. Else the Flextubes are a bit easier to set up and hold collimation quite well for such a design.

Collimation, light shroud, (more weight of SOME designs), ... Those can all be dealt with, but will increase the hassle.

There are nice ultra light dobsonians but they are pretty expensive. I have a 10" from Sumerian optics that weighs just under 10kg/22lbs, and together with book/chair/light/eyepieces/bottle I would not want to carry around more, even for a mile or two.

I don't know about you, but even 40 pounds would'nt be something I would like to carry for a mile, no matter how good the carrying case is :-)

Before I purchased my 10" travel telescope I packed watter bottles in a tracking backpack and went for a walk, and came to the conclusion that this is the absolute maximum I'd call portable.Hi,  thanks, what car do you have?

Would you be able to handle a 8", with each the base and tube weighing around 10kg/22lbs? Else this would determine which solution would be better suited.

Well, visual and imaging have very different requirements (Aperture VS tracking mount). A z12 would not really be suited for imaging but is an amazing telescope for visual. The tube will be longer than the 6-10" dobsonians though.

For a 12", a flextube can be nice. But if you can transport/handle a closed tube, the closed tube has mostly benefits.

Computerized/Goto-&gt; What tools are you currently using? (telescope, binoculars, map, app?) Most of the time the lack of a good finder scope, overview eyepiece and good map is what causes the problems. You don't have to know every star, just need a good book/map :-) Obligatory http://bennyhillthis.com/?v=bE91I-O78bcHello :-)

The telescope has a very short focal length mirror, an aperture ratio of &lt;=F/4, which typically has a few issues - especially in this price range (not suited well for high magnifications if not perfectly parabolized mirror, lower contrast due to a larger secondary obstruction, cheap eyepieces will only be sharp in the center, coma in the outer field).

If you are willing to spend up to $800, you should consider something better :-)

What do you want to observe? If deep-sky, how bad is the light pollution at your observing location (can you see the milky way when your eyes are adapted)? How portable does it need to be?

[Here a few links on what things look like through different telescope apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

.

Without knowing more about what you expect and what requirements you have: [A 8" dobonian is a typical recommendation](http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html). It shows a lot, is a good all-rounder, still fits into most cars. Together with a better wide-angle eyepiece ([$110](http://www.kwtelescope.com/accessories/optical/eyepieces/70-80-deg-fov/32mm-orion-q70-wide-field-telescope-eyepiece.html)), a (planetary) eyepiece or two (e.g. 6mm, 15mm; [$49](http://maisonastronomie.ca/en/product-category/eyepieces/?add-to-cart=316)), a collimation tool ($[0](http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165)-$100), a good map/[book](http://www.amazon.ca/Turn-Left-Orion-Hundred-Telescope/dp/0521781906) (The most important tool for using a telescope ;-) ) and possibly a [Telrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9)... This can last a life-time :-)

.

If you require a more compact solution, the Skywatcher Heritage 130p or a 3-5" Maksutov can be a great solution. These still fit in a back-pack.

If you are a fan of refractors, a 90/900 is very affordable starter telescope, or you could even get something larger. But large refractors can get quite expensive and require a sturdy mount.

For mainly visual &amp; deep-sky, the dobsonian offers the best bang for the buck. Huge aperture, intuitive, simple but very rigid base, leaving more money for the optics.


.

Also some binoculars. Even [some](http://www.amazon.ca/Celestron-71198-Cometron-7x50-Binoculars/dp/B00DV6SI3Q) cheaper ones can show a bunch of clusters, nebulae and galaxies, and as they show a larger field of view and are more intuitive to use they can help you a great deal when you can not locate an object through the telescope right away.

It's not as simple as attaching a camera to an eyepiece. 

You will need a tracking mount for deep-sky objects. Taking images of the planets is possible with a manual telescope if the telescope has enough back-focus and you have enough patience :-)

 - Consider reading https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescope

Have you tried imaging with a fixed tripod, or looked into building a barn-door?

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce


For visual, aperture is key ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)). For visual, you could even get a 12" dobsonian.

For imaging, a precision *equatorial* tracking mount. Getting both on a budget results in some foul compromise. For imaging within your budget, you could get a 6" on a motorized EQ mount and some accessories. But honestly, starting imaging with something smaller is easier and you can still get stunning results. E.g.  [this](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) with only camera + tracking mount.

Hello again :-)

Have you looked at a few deep-sky objects with your binoculars before? E.g. M42, M81/M82, M31, h&amp;Chi Persei, NGC7000... Or the phases of Venus &amp; Jupiter+moons?

Really get "Turn left at Orion", it's a great guide for visual, binoculars and small to medium telescopes. :-)

Aperture is key, telescope that have an upright image tend to be more expensive than a simple reflector, good erecting eyepieces are not quite as common. For day-time use and as very light travel telescope a 90mm or 102mm Maksutov on a rigid camera tripod is really nice. Sadly these are more expensive outside of the US (where the c90 costs only $145usd). Or a small refractor. But such small telescopes limit what you can see, especially regarding deep-sky. Again, see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

The 8" will show a lot both regarding planets and deep-sky, it's nice from both the back yard or a truly dark site. The upside-down image is not an issue when viewing the night sky, it's pretty easy to get used to.

A 5" Maksutov can be nice city-telescope too, but they have a few down-sides (more expensive per aperture, smaller field of view, cool-down-time).

Hello,

that's definitely a good choice for visual astronomy :-) 

In the US, the Zhumel sets offer the best accessories. The  Zhumell z8 is currently out of stock for a while though :-( the z10 is nice, but you will need a few accessories to get the most out of it. Skywatcher's 8" is currently on sale, $355, leaving some money for a $70 wide angle eyepiece (that's already included in the Zhumell set).

In Canada, kwtelescopes has the Orion XT8 for $371cad, in europe Skywatcher or the GSO deluxe sets are the best option.


.

You will need one or two additional eyepieces to get the most out of it. And a map/book :-) But that depends on the choice of telescope, so no recommendation at this point. Just keep in mind the 10" dobsonian is just about in your budget, but has basic accessories.


.

As mentioned, there's also the Celestron Nexstar 127 SLT. It's a nice 5" Maksutov on a simple AltAz GoTo mount. Not ideal for imaging, but possible. The 5" will be a nice planet telescope for the city. If you aim for faint deep-sky objects, it might not be the best choice for you, though. It costs about as much as the 8" dobsonian ($439 on Amazon currently)Hello :-)

What starter kit does he have?

What is he interested in? (Robots, home automation, games...)Take the universe for a spin: http://www.shatters.net/celestia/Hello :-)

What is your budget? As the XT4.5 costs ~$268 you might consider other options as well.

Yes, you are right. A larger telescope shows more (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)) but of course they are larger as well.

For $300 you can get a 6" dobsonian that will out-perform those mentioned and it's also high enough to use while seated. So while it can not simply be placed on a tripod, there is no need to take a tripod along in the first place. The rockerbox mount of these is also very stable and low cost, leaving more for the actual optics.

 - http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6
 
For $355 you can get a 8" dobsonian which can last a life-time.

 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z4G3PRK?keywords=skywatcher%20dobsonian&amp;qid=1446930949&amp;ref_=sr_1_10&amp;sr=8-10

The 6 an 8" dobsonians fit into a typical car (tube on the back-seat) and the weight is still easy manageable (8"'s base and tube weigh  around 10kg/22lbs each). 

.

If you are looking for a more compact solution:

There's also the [AWB Onesky](http://store.astronomerswithoutborders.org/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=5&amp;products_id=4&amp;zenid=k98f0rvoeu7os1qoc3t8sb23a7) $199. IT has a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but it's overall a good entry level telescope. It outperforms the small 4" table-top.

Or the Maksutov telescopes. They are one of the most compact telescopes, e.g. the C90 $145 (you'll just need a rigid camera tripod) or a 4" (102mm, e.g. Orion 9823). But the larger 5" costs a bit more ($400-$450 but on a computerized tripod) and does not show quite as much as the 6" or even 8" dobsonian.It's the Skyscanner 100 and Orion SkyQuest 4.5" Dobsonian  (10014) :-) Hello,

glad it did not get any major damage :-(

Transporting the mirror, especially of my 10", always scares me a bit as well (did I tighten the transport bolt of the 10"? Does the Heritage tube sit firmly on the foam pad?) But these thick chunks are amazingly rigid.

I always remove the finder now, it already took some minor damage on my 130p.

The up-side of the reflectors is that if something gets damaged (unless it's the mirror), it's easy to fix. :-) When my scope arrived, the parcel delivery company did a great job testing how well it was packaged. The secondary mirror holder needed a little twist...This :-) But to sum it up: Open construction (fix: light shroud cardboard), low to the ground (small camping stool and/or box/crate), not ideal for high magnifications (but beats many 4" entry level telescopes). The advantages of the design is that it's very portable and in this price range one of the few you can still fit inside a larger back-pack.

I can understand that $300 is over your budget. The 6" will be a step up though. What area are you from? I could look at CL as you can often get a used 6" or even 8" for around $200.

But of course you can have a lot of fun with the 4-5" telescopes! In fact I use my AWB/130p the most as it's so small and quick to set up. But as you can get the SkyScanner 100 so cheap (or even [cheaper](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-SkyScanner-100mm-TableTop-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/102360.uts?refineByCategoryId=81)) it's certainly a nice porch-telescope (but better for wide-field and with some optical flaws due to the extreme aperture ratio).

Have you looked at the link comparing what is visible in different telescope apertures?

How portable does it need to be?&gt;  I feel jealous! 

Orion 9823? :-)For nebulae you have two options. But both require a motorized tracking mount.

A DSLR: For exposures over ~30s you will need a equatorial mount (or a wedge). The longer delay might not be ideal for outreach/groups, and it's a bit more complicated for such a task.

A Video-astronomy camera: Yes, it's low resolution, but it's fine for showing things. Did you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiCNmYdkaE)? It is a bit delayed but as "realtime" as it gets. It too requires a motorized tracking mount, but the camera can be set to stack (typically around) 2-30 seconds, so a EQ mount is not mandatory. With the long focal length the field of view of such a CCTV/Deepsky-camera. The camera sensor has a high crop-factor, meaning the field of view is similar to a 6mm Pl\u00f6ssl, so over 200x magnification. That's a bit much for deep-sky. A 0.5x or 0.33x focal reducer will give you a larger field of view. You can get some simple ones for under $20, but same as barlows, the better ones cost quite  a bit. A cheaper one will probably do for video-astronomy, though :-)  

Sadly the cheap Aliexpress-links to CCTV that work are not valid anymore, but you can get commercial cameras (Astro-photo.co.uk, Mallincam). Astro-Video even has [bare modules](http://www.astro-video.com/diy-camera-module-board.html) if you feel comfortable with tinkering and perhaps own a 3D printer.


It's been a while that I looked around on the market. The VA section of Stargazerlounge might be helpful. I am sure there are some chinese CCTV cameras for $50 you can use (Basically you just need to remove the UV filter slide or remove it's power cable). The camera used for the video was a modified CCTV, but with a good mount/telescope set-up under dark skies.Hello :-)

Did you check out this link?


&gt; [Here a few links on what things look like through different telescope apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

In the end, aperture is key. Of course a refractor has less obstruction, or a Maksutov a long focal length which makes it easy to reach high magnifications, but at the end, a 5" will show less than a 8" of similar quality &amp; good eyepieces. Especially for deep-sky. 

For planets, a good, longer 4" refractor will beat the short 5" entry level reflector easily, but the price difference for mount &amp; telescope is quite noticeable.

As you can see in one of the links, you **can** see more in a 5" than a 8" depending on the experience and light pollution. Also, using a smaller telescope more often than a larger one that's too big to lug around always shows more :-) So it also depends on what you make of it. 

If comparing under the same conditions though, the larger aperture wins.

.

The 130P (or AWB Onesky in the US) is a great telescope. Even with my larger dobsonian. It's a nice "secondary" telescope when you don't feel like using the larger one, and on a crate/bekv\u00e4m it also works great on my balcony which is too narrow for the 8".

The 3-4" Maks are great as they are so small and portable. I do not use them as often for astonomy anymore, but they are great for traveling, observing ships at the shore, or quick glimpses of the moon.

The 5" Maksutov, especially the Nexstar slt 127, is a great compromise if you live in the city, don't want to lug around a larger telescope and plan on observing planets from your balcony the most. 5" already shows a lot, and the design beats the Heritage/AWB for high magnifications (but not for wide-field). The computerized GoTo mount of the SLT set is not perfect, but great for what it is (and at least in the US the set costs just a tad more than the bare telescope). You can also do some very basic imaging with that set-up, but the telescope and AltAz-type mount are not suited for longer exposures.You could hook up headphones to the Arduino. If you have alligator clips, that'll work fine. Or cut a old/broken headphone cable and connect those

. Or the other way around, use the cable+plug to feed the sound into the soundcard (if it's too quiet, many soundcard's advanced settings offer a gain checkbox). BUT don't just connect a wire to the mic/line-in. Search for Soundcard oscilloscope circuits for example, or at least connect a larger resistor &amp; voltage divider.

Hi :-)

Also consider starting with fixed-tripod imaging and possibly a "barn-door", see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce) :-)

It's fun to use a camera and wide-angle lens, and you can already capture the Andormeda galaxy, several star-clusters and nebulae this way. It' a great way to learn about night-time photography before investing a lot into a telescope (and perhaps saves you from buying something completely wrong).

Also, "making every photon count" is a great read before investing.Hello,

what area has to be heated? What is it for?

Heating something is always quite power consuming.

If you need something cheap &amp; hackable, you could use one of the USB cup-warmers (they don't get all that hot, at leat the ones I saw so far) or shoe inlays / [something like this](http://www.ebay.de/itm/5V-USB-Heating-Element-Film-Heater-6-20CM-for-Warm-Feet-Warmer-Electric-Belts-/272018921582?hash=item3f5597586e:g:594AAOSwwbdWIiUL).

Asuming it complies with USB 1/2 standards it will require 5V/0.5A=2.5W, but may also consume more.


There are also heating elements for reprap extruders (for small areas) or heated bed PCB (for a larger surface), but they are designed for 12v and higher currents (but if you are only aiming for 35\u00b0C it won't be that much /* edit: Not sure how much, [this at 50\u00b0, 100\u00b0](http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/makerbot-thingomatic-power-consumption/) was the closest info I could find and my 3d printer with heated bed isn't with me ATM*/).

What size/battery did you have in mind?
 Very nice! :-)

For electronics: Get her a copy of "Getting Started in Electronics" (simple, kid friendly) or "Practical Electronics for Inventors" (still easy, more background information) as they will give here a better understanding of electronics than just learning a few things on the way :-)

How old is she?  

&gt; bb gun 

Telescopes would sell much better if one was included (and if it where legal ;-) )


&gt; weirdly shaped

How so? At high magnification the seeing will play a role, the airy disk may look distorted; The secondary holder struds will cause diffraction spikes; In the outer field coma will be an issue. Overall a reflector will not have pin-point sharp stars as compared to refractors.

&gt; chair

I told you so ;-) Sometimes it's the little things that make the difference.

&gt; eyepatch

Helps if there is direct light sources around, not as effective as that BB gun, but at least legal ;-)

&gt; dew

Yep, a dew shield will help. A fan/hairdryer can certainly help to clear the fog. A heated secondary is another solution (my 10" has it, it's neat, but there are other solutions-&gt; 12v hairdryer, dewshield).

&gt; collimation


If the primary's center ring is in the center, that's already good.

Usually a telescope's secondary has three screws and a center bolt; Do not rotate/change the spider vanes. You should tilt the mirror, not rotate it.

Orion/Plejads -&gt; Congratulations on your first light! I am sure you can get the problems sorted out and see a lot more :-)
That's in my 10", it locks/holds the primary into place during transport. A piece of plastic presses against the side of the mirror so it can not move around.This :-)

But there's also [Moon dogs](http://www.space.com/20239-moondogs-moon-photo-alaska.html)... woof.Hello,

did it work on another Arduino?

How did you hook it up, what do you use to power it, do you have the full code?Star shape - [Coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baader_Rowe_Coma_Corrector_Comparison.jpg) distortion in a F/6 telescope will only be slightly visible in the outer most field.

Misalignment and bad seeing can cause it to be more [prominent](http://www.loptics.com/articles/starshape/starshape.html). 

Other problems are astigmatism (either of the eyepiece, or worse, the mirror!) 

Also see

 - http://umich.edu/~lowbrows/reflections/2007/dscobel.27.html

 - http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/ae4.html#astigmatism


And of course there's the diffraction spikes, which can be less or more visible depending on the thickness of the secondary spider veins and the brightness of the stars: http://www.themcdonalds.net/richard/index.php?title=File:Astrophoto-diffraction-spikes.jpg 

Did you see the distortion with all eyepieces and/or did it get worse at higher magnifications?

.

Yeah, dew can be awful in general. But just let your telescope dry (a bit angled so no puddle forms on the primary ;-) ) before you close&amp;store it. The plywood should not be harmed.  Take a look at the first picture [in this German forum](http://www.astrotreff.de/pop_printer_friendly.asp?ARCHIVE=True&amp;TOPIC_ID=83173) ;-) These telescopes are simple and withstand all kind of weather.  

.

Collimating the secondary: Usually you loosen them and you can tilt the mirror. Unless it's stuck or the screws all the way in or out. Here's a [random video](https://youtu.be/8G98RTP6jbY?t=161) on the subject.

.

Yeah, without glasses you can see more of the field. With astigmatism you can use eyepieces without glasses if the exit pupil is around ~1mm  (under 2mm, depends). Sadly eyepieces with &gt;15mm eye relief are quite expensive.

Clear skies!Just tighten then in a normal matter :-) The glass is really thick, I would be more afraid of putting too much tension on the glass during transport than warping the glass.Yeah, the Plejads are a bit large even with the 30mm :-) But a lot of objects will look nice in higher magnifications as well.

Not sure why they won't move unless the manufacturer now uses thread lock laquer...? Perhaps someone else has an idea (or contact the shop's service). 

Scope drying-&gt; Good :-)


No clue, yes, it would be absurd :-) Try what was suggested in the thread then (using more leverage and holding the secondary holder to avoid bending anything).

Why would you loose some light from the primary? You mean right now? Yes, if the primary is aligned the performance will still be quite alright.

.

When dry, I just store the tube upright.

.

Yes, go give Orion a try, under low light pollution and a bit more magnification it's great :-) Try different eyepieces, and observing for a bit.

.

Yeah, I have 10x50 and while binocluars are easier than a single scope, 10x is indeed a bit much for me to hold comfortably over a longer period of time. I now have some smaller 8x21 which are quite nice, but I'll probably get 6x30 or 7x50 or something like that.Hello &amp; This! :-)  A refractor on EQ is not small either.

The 8" disassembles into base and tube, it's not too difficult to find a place (in a corner of the basement, under the bed, on-top of a wardrobe/shelf). Also you can get a 6" which is a bit smaller.

Also see the image montage of this store: [Astropetes](http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html)

.

As you can see there are many options, it can be quite overwhelming. The StarBlast 6" is nice; The Nexstar SLT 127 (5") costs ~$430 and  comes on a simple GoTo mount. It can be a really nice telescope for the balcony ;-)

In the end, [Aperture is key](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622). If you can store a larger 6 or 8" dobsonian, they will perform better than the other mentioned choices. Also check out the Flextube/Collapsible.

If you require something more compact, e.g. to take along in a backpack, the AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p outside the US) for $199 is cheap and versatile. It will not perform as well as the 5" Mak or a larger telescope when it comes to planets, but still outperforms most 3-4" telescopes. It's strong side is wide-field / deep-sky. Also the 4" Maksutov is very portable and you can use it on a rigid camera tripod.

It's always a trade-off between aperture, weight/size and cost. You can still have a lot of fun with something smaller, and even from within a city some deep-sky observing is possible. A portable set-up is nice to have, but if you are going to mostly observe from your location, and if you can somehow make it fit, the larger telescopes will have less compromises and show quite a bit more.

As HoeMuffin wrote, go to a local club/meet-up to see what's possible and what telescope choices are available :-)Hello :-)

I know you want to stay under $300, but also consider the 6" dobsonian:

 - http://www.telescopes.com/collections/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonians/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6 

It will be less of a compromise, performs well in any discipline. The $200 telescopes have one flaw or another, either a weak mount/tripod or flawed optics... The 6" is on a simple but rigid rockerbox, and the optics are good.

.

In the end, aperture is key... for everything.

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

But of course a smaller, portable telescope can be a lot of fun, too. In fact I use the telescope /u/vestris mentioned the most as I can fit it into a back-pack and just walk to a nearby field where it's darker and thus more deep-sky objects are visible. It has a few [quirks, but overall it's a great telescope](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew). The larger 6" will fit into a car, but it's not nearly as portable.

.

The AstroMaster-sets can not be recommended in general. They have a lot of overpriced and bad sets, some are OK, though in general, the mount is on the weak side. The Astromaster 130eq for example is OK (but the mount not really rigid for such a telescope), but the Meade Polaris 130eq is a bit cheaper. The Astromaster 114 on the other hand is a "bird-jones" telescope with  flaws due to it's design. The 3" Astromaster telescopes will not show as much as the larger ones.

.
 
In general, a reflector offers the biggest aperture for your money. A nice 90/900 refractor or a 4" can still be very nice, but for deep-sky objects, a 5, 6 or even 8" will show more.

.

If you want (and if it's an option), post what area you're from, and we could look what's available on CL right now. You can often get a 6" or 8" dobsonian for $200 or so.


.

GoTo: Good :-) With a good map/book and good finder-scope locating objects isn't hard either and can be a lot of fun. Plus the set-up time is shorter.  "Turn left at Orion" is one of THE starter books that does not only show you where to find an object, but what's worthwhile observing, how   to observe and what to expect. It's also an easier read than most GoTo-manuals :-)

That USB Eyepiece will not be good for deep-sky, sorry. It even says in the description:

 &gt; While not sensitive enough to capture images of faint deep space objects,

Go with a modified CCTV camera. The shop I linked to has refurbished one that cost about the same, and on ebay, you can get them even cheaper. You will need a USB capture device, the simple ones start at $8 or so, but of course there are better ones.

Depending on the camera, you won't need a Barlow, you will need a **Reducer**. With a DSLR you will need a barlow to take images of the planets, but the Webcams/CCTV have much smaller sensors, the crop factor will result in a smaller field of view. Also the kit you've linked to has one of the cheapest, plastic-y barlows out there, it will most certainly not suffice :-) If you need to go cheap, Corvus-Optics has a $22 achromatic Barlow IIRC, and as for reducers, you can get some in this price range as well, e.g. [this one with adapter to fit  CCTVs on 1.25" telescopes](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-C-Mount-Adapter-for-Telescope-0-5X-Focal-Reducer-adapter-w-0-5x-focal-reducer/32253964264.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.44.o2hZMT&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9) or the bare lens [[1](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-1-25-Telescope-0-5-Focal-Reducer-Threads-M28-5x0-6-for-31-75mm/32460938556.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.11.EtbPhG&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9), [2](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Threaded-1-25-0-5x-Focal-Reducer-For-Telescope-Eyepiece-for-Photography-and-Observing/32397854475.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.26.o2hZMT&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_2_79_78_77_91_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_9)] - I have one that looks like #2, for the price it's OK.

Neat, see if you can find out what's wrong with the mount, it would be great if you get it working again. Else there's the question what to do... E.g. build a pipe-mount of the telescope, or get a new mount? Though even if you get a different (cheaper) mount, there's the question if the money would not get you another one or two telescopes, or even selling the set and using your current camera budget to get a bunch of smaller telescopes so the group can observe.
Hi :-) Too bad, but it will be up for a couple of weeks :-)

This morning I could see the moon and two planets, which is rare, as the fog is a problem in this season :-)

Yeah, basically if the primary is aligned that will be one of the major things. I am sure you can get the screws to budge though :-)Hello :-)

The cheaper one has more stuff. You can always get the 70 cent Ultrasonic/distance-sensor, a $2-$3 breadboard-shield (and that's about the biggest differences I can see besides the other keypad) later or elsewhere.

Do you have any tutorials you are going to use? Then you can get the parts required (and that are not in the kit).

I second /u/FrankenberryPi's suggestion, a few more components never hurt, unless you want to tear everything apart again after you are done.

You can get Arduino clones for $1.70-$2.80 (Nano/Uno) or the Wifi-board ESP8266 for $1.80-$2.80 (esp-01, esp-201), and breadboards for $1-$2 (e.g. 270/830 tie points).

The starter kit has probably all you need to get going, though. [Here's a list with some more components](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874) (Probably not up-to-date by now but you get the idea).

Do you have a soldering iron and a multimeter? A multimeter costs $3-$4, and those work fine if you only tinker with low current/voltage. A soldering iron is another subject... I avoided soldering as long as I could, but mostly due to bad soldering equipment. It does come in handy at times, especially if you want to make something more permanent. While you can get soldering irons for under $2 (yes, they work, no, they are not good) a adjustable soldering station ($20 at Amazon, $80 for something decent if you use it regularly) is the way to go.

Also keep in mind that the Arduino can't supply a lot of current if you are trying to drive things like the Wifi module or a lot of servos. You can get &lt;1$ breadboard power adapters for smaller things, and perhaps a regulated power supply for bigger things.

Also if you would like to make some battery operated stuff, the voltage boosters (30-80 cents ea.) are great.This. You can get something like this new for around $100, e.g. Celestron Powerseeker 114eq (with 1.25" focuser even).

Building a rockerbox is the only way to make this thing stable :-( But it's not hard to do. Also see [this](http://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/). I made a ultra-simple version with 5th graders ([these](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg)).

For $100 (or under, if you look at Telescope.com's "2nd" section) there's the Orion SkyScanner 100. While the optics are not as good as a 114/900, it's rigid base gives you an overall better experience.

For $145 there's the Celestron c90 (but you'll need a rigid camera tripod). For a bit more there is the Meade Polaris 130 or Astromaster 130, but the AWB Onesky costs around the same and is more rigid.

For $300-$400 you can get a 6 or 8" dobsonian which have less flaws overall. Used, you can sometimes pick those up for $200.

While I agree that binoculars are a great tool for astronomy, it is not True that you can not get a good telescope for below $300. This is simply misleading and discouraging beginners that can not afford a more expensive telescope. The options are limited, but there are several nice telescopes for under $300. For example 4.5-5" reflectors, 3-4" Maksutovs or 3.5" reflectors.
 Hello,

that is a great project! Best of luck! :-)

I've seen images/video of the watch and it's really nice.

First off: I have never built something like this, but a bit of experience with Arduino and 3D printing.

If you do not want the mechanics to be visible... you don't need any. Arduino would be a relatively cheap &amp; easy solution to this.

Instead of gears you can just use motors and control the speed with the microcontroller/Arduino.

You will find all oribtal periods and distances at Wikipedia or sites like this: http://www.windows2universe.org/our_solar_system/planets_table.html

Do you want to make elliptical orbits? To scale, the slight elliptical nature of the orbits would be invisible (for most objects) in a smaller scale. 

A simple approach could be to put a motor for each planet under the "table" (opposite to a gear mechanic running everything). Depending on the size/weight of the planets you could get away with rather small ones, cutting the cost.

My first idea was a set of stacked discs with either ball bearings or just teflon sliders, with continous servos (and round counters) or steppers, either friction driven or with a toothed belt, making them spin at different speeds.

Strong Neodymium magnets on each disc to make the planet model move over a solid surface over the mechanics.

Possibly spinning the magnet with another motor to let the planet spin as well.

The problem with this (and the big disadvantage to a gear driven system) is supplying the spinning parts with power.

You can find some Orrery plans on Thingiverse.Did it move? If so, it could have been the ISS or another iridium flare.

If a satellite is close to the horizon moving "towards" you, it may not seem to be moving much at first.

It'll vanish pretty quickly.This!

Hello :-)

For deep-sky, low light pollution and aperture are the two most important factors.

Aperture: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

Light pollution: Can you see the milky way?  Planets and some brighter DSO can be easily observed from within the city, but for faint nebulae you will need to find a darker location :-)


.

While a 8" is the best considered price/performance (and can last you a life-time) a smaller telescope can be a lot of fun.

I own the Heritage 130p and it's a nice secondary telescope, even if you have a larger one. But the views through a 8" are significantly more impressive.

.

Do you own binoculars by the way? Quite a bunch of galaxies, nebulae and clusters are visible through binoculars. Also the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter.

.

"Turn left at Orion" is a great starter guide for visual, binoculars, small to medium telescopes. Not only does it show you where to find objects, but also which are worthwhile observing, how to observe, and what to expect. Together with a dim red light it'll also preserve night-vision better than a back-lit phone/tablet display.

.

Eyepieces: Depends on the telescope :-)

Some info and suggetions for the Heritage/AWB [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew)

For a 6" or 8" that's another matter. A 2" wide angle overview eyepiece can help a lot as it'll show a larger [field of view](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg), but they also cost a bit more. A decent eyepiece for planets will cost something around 24 to 120gbp depending on what you are willing to spend :-)Because I can't collimate it when it's tightened and the mirror would be under pressure all the time :-)Wow, even with small $1 servo motors from Aliexpress, that would be over $1000 just for those :-)

There are smaller, cheaper steppers, but they can't handle a lot of load and controller + pins would be more expensive (while the servo has a controller built in and you can use a 4017 to drive multiple on one output).

//edit: 830 servos? http://www.smoothware.com/danny/woodenmirror.html - also,   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2562247/The-mirrors-WOOD-Artist-turns-everyday-items-sculptures-reflect-stood-them.htmlWinding little actuator coils? PWM driven, Transistor/Mosfet? Wow, my fingers get tired after winding three coils :-)Hi :-)

They have this one http://www.astro-video.com/dso-camera-body-dso-1.html (and cheaper in the refurbished section). The body looks identical to a cheap one I have.  You could also ask the people at the SGL forum (Video astronomy board) regarding current recommended cameras.

.

Mount- It's hard to tell what's wrong/missing; Replacement hand controllers is quite pricey unless you get one used. It has to suit the mount though. I am not sure what is compatible with the lx650, if the 200 or etx handsets work (avl. for $90 or so), but I suppose you can ask a astronomy dealer or the manufacturer.

Perhaps find someone locally who has a compatible controller/mount and see if yours still work.

Some mounts can be controlled via PC directly, where the PC does the work of the hand controller.  I only know of this -&gt;

 - http://www.nexstarsite.com/PCControl/NexRemote.htm

 - http://www.dv-fansler.com/dvf%20Technologies/lx200_keypad_sim.htm

.

If you sell it you will probably get quite a bit, I don't know which route is  a better solution in the long run. 

You can get decent starter telescopes for $100-$200, so that's an option. What I did is to buy several used/refurbished 4/5" telescopes for $50 and built rockerbox mounts with students... five decent telescopes for under 300 bucks.

Mh, something like those mirrors would certainly be a neat project.

I checked Aliexpress, also for Solenoids - sadly they are not cheaper.

They have smaller steppers for 14 to 20 cents, and DC motors start at something like that as well, but with motor drivers and the amount of ports required for the steppers that won't be much cheaper either. Well, maybe a little bit.What steppers did you have in mind?

Servos would reduce the cost greatly, e.g. driving [9 on one](http://www.jbergsmann.at/servo-signal-demultiplex-ppm-pwm.htm#f7) or [10 on two](http://rcarduino.blogspot.de/2012/08/arduino-serial-servos.html) pins.

4017 costs &lt;13 cents or so.

But of course the servos would draw quite some current and are not as precise.
 :-)

And on the other hand, a mini 168 or nano costs $1.20 / $1.80 and would eliminate the whole multi/demultiplexing :-)Hello :-)

Check out this kit: http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062

That has almost everything (perhaps a hc-sr04 ultrasonic distance module, i2c adapter for the lcd, H-Bridge....) to make a lot of things.

Also consider a soldering iron with adjustable temperature (start at $20 at Amazon, better ones $80), a multimeter (For low current/voltages a cheap $3-$4 multimeter will do), and possibly some [generic parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874).

Banggood is a reliable supplier. Aliexpress-&gt; Check the ratings. If they have over 95% positive seller  reviews, at least "diamond" status, and positive product reviews, there's not much to worry about. I use a prepaid credit card, the few problems I had where resolved by customer service (they also have a buyer protection). 

Also check out a tutorial you want to follow and see what additional parts you will need :-) (Tutorials;
[1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH
) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) [5](http://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-free-book-for-beginners/)) Also another Arduino or two (Nano $1.80, Uno $2.70) and breadboard might be a good idea.Hello :-)

As it's a component that'll work with a regular RC receiver, you can control it with regular servo signals :-)

According to another store, the "smart" functions are handled by the device itself. You can hook them up in series, and triggering the release again will be executed by the next in line - or in a time delay mode.

Just my two cents, I never had one of these. Good luck with your project!

Any advantage of this one over a $1-$2 micro servo? Just the connivance/less parts?At Aliexpress as well, the Nano are a dollar cheaper, the mini yet a bit more. But the Uno typically comes ready to run, the Nano/Mini need their pin rows to be soldered on.

Of course there are sellers with hundreds of sold items for a tad more.

(Random links, check reviews/ratings, YMMV. The clones have a different usb-serial chip, but drivers are easy to find)

The Arduino is surprisingly rigid, neither myself nor one of my students managed to fry one so far :-)Which kit exactly? :)This! :-) 

The bird-jones is less than ideal and better sets cost around the same (Meade Polaris 130, Astromaster 130).

The bird-jones have a much shorter tube than their specified focal length. An additional lens supposedly corrects the problems of the  short focal length mirror, but causes some issues (collimation, contrast).

SkyWatcher's 6" dobsonian costs  $305
http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6

The 8" starts at $355 (Sadly the Zhumell z8 is sold out, it has better accessories than the SW or Orion xt8).

Visually, aperture is key: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

The dobsonian rockerbox has two advantages: Cheap, leaving more money for the actual optics, and it's RIGID. At high magnifications, this is crucial, otherwise it will be tedious to focus, track and observe.

Astro-photography without a telescope, just on a tripod or "barn-door" DIY tracker: https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce

.

There is the Celestron Astromaster 130eq MD (Motor drive). The mounts of the starter sets are a bit too weak, and the 5" will show less in any regard. But the MD mount + just the camera could be useful.

Usually one should start astro imaging from a fixed tripod, it'll give  a feel why astrophotograpy is so much more complicated than it might first seem.

For simple planetary imaging and snapshots of deep-sky objects, the Celestron Nexstar STL127 or similar can be a nice entry level device, but as the mount is not equatorial and the telescope has a slow focal ratio it's not suited for deep-sky imaging. Also most money goes into the plastic-y goTo mount. It's a nice gadget, but a 8" for the same cost will simply show much more than the 5" Goto telescope.

For imaging, read https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescopeHi, glad I could help :-)

Thanks!

Have fun with Arduino &amp; good luck with your projects, let us know what you come up with :-)Hello :-)
 
A 80mm will show significantly less than other choices available for $250. A short achromatic refractor like this will also have poor performance regarding planets. At high magnifications, these "shorties" will show a lot of chromatic aberration, lowering the contrast. It's anything but a planetary telescope. Of course you can still see them, but probably not what you have hoped for :-)

While you can take some simple images, the mount is not ideal for long exposures, and for planets, the focal length of this short refractor is limiting as well.

For  seeing the Cassini division of the rings of Saturn, 80mm will make it more difficult. It's easier to spot with something &gt;=4".

.


You can sometimes get [these](https://savannah.craigslist.org/for/5285886786.html) 114/900 on EQ2 (NOT the short 114/1000 bird-jones type) for $50 used, they would perform so much better.

This one would be a steal but not nearby: https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/for/5297046448.html

.

GoTo always seems nice, and hey, it is! But the problem is that in this budget range you will get a tiny telescope as most money goes towards a plastic-y GoTo mount that's not suited well for Astro Photography (AltAz instead of Equatorial, not too precise).

Planets are easy to track manually. With a wide-field eyepiece (starting at  $24-$35 at dhgate/aliexpress/corvusoptics) it's no Tribble at all, even if you having troubles with manually finding deep-sky objects.

A small 80mm aperture on a GoTo mount might be able to point at many things, but most of them will not be spectacular or even invisible.

.


If you insist on GoTo, there are a few better options:

- Used. Find something with 4"-5" aperture

- More. A Nexstar SLT127 for $399-$449 depending on current offers. A 5" Mak is great for planets and you won't have the impression of it being too small right away. Or get one of the "Intelliscope" things. But really, you can use a map/app instea.

- Small GoTo suitable for planets. 

 - This small Maksutov for example: http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-virtuoso-90mm-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope (edit: Replaced link with a store that has it in stock)
 
 - It's more ideal for planets, but 90mm is still a bit limiting. In my 5" manual telescope for under $200 the planets appear more detailed and brighter, too. 

- Compromise. E.g. a Celestron Astromaster 130eq MD (Motor drive). Not very rigid, so not great for imaging, but at least it's possible to use just camera+tripod for wide-field and also use the telescope for some planet imaging. The 130/650 telescope is not as great as a 5" Maksutov or a 6" dobsonian regarding planets, but it'll beat many of the cheaper kits. 

- Overthink. A 6" dobsonian $305 (or possibly used 8" for $200-$250!) will show so much more details. For planets you can take some basic images, though tracking manually can be a bit tedious (unless you have a good finder scope). You can also built a EQ Platform for tracking.

.

How much do you intend on spending including accessories/eyepieces? Some kits require more stuff than others that already include nice eyepieces.

.

How light/compact would the telescope need to be? 

Will you use it at home or transport it to darker locations (car, backpack?)

What did you use so far for star hopping (what map/book/finder?)? I dislike star-hopping as well. A Telrad finder changed all that, it's fairly easy as you just align the finder to a set of stars as shown on special maps :-)

.

Also, [the obligatory link of what to expect in different apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)Hello,

consider the Zhumell z8 if you are in no hurry, it's not in stock currently though. It comes with better accessories.

Also, the Skywatcher 8" is on sale for $355, so it leaves a bit of budget for a better eyepiece.

My suggestion for a 8" would be

A 30-36mm overview eyepiece, depending on how dark your sky gets. E.g. the 30mm GSO at AgenaAstro for $70. A 2" wide-angle eyepiece will show a larger field of view; http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg

A 6mm 66\u00b0 GoldLine, $35 shipped from Corvus Optics, $24 from Aliexpress/dhgate.

One or two inbetween, e.g. the 15mm Gold-Line.

The gold line are cheap wide-angle eyepieces with better eye relief than cheaper Pl\u00f6ssl.

http://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html

http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/

The TMB HR Planetary clones for $35-$50 or BST Explorer are also good entry level eyepieces.

Barlows will ad chromatic aberration (lowering the contrast), and a decent 6mm does not cost much more. Also barlowing a cheap kit eyepiece is not the best combination, and the field of view should be larger at 200x magnification or so to easier track the planets. 

A Telrad finder can be a nice addition, too. 

Sadly only the Zhumell has a dual-speed focuser and some other accessories like the 2" eyepiece included. The Orion XT8 has more basic accessories, and not even the XT8 deluxe/plus 2" eyepiece is good. The Skywatcher has a decent finder but the rest is basic as well.Hello :-)

Great advice so far!

If you decide to get a dobsonian, consider the Zhumell (z10). Compared to the other dobsonians it has a lot of accessories (dual speed focuser, 2" wide angle eyepiece already included, decent finder, collimation tool, moon filter...).

As /u/HoeMuffin pointed out, be aware of the size of these. There's a collage at http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html .

.

The difference a wide-angle eyepiece will make:

 - [Overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg)

 - [Planets](http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png) (Easier to track, more in the field of view) - Opposite to u/HoeMuffin I do not find it difficult to track objects manually at over 200x, and the cheaper "gold line" eyepiece works just fine for me. I am not sure if there are varying designs of this eyepiece though, or if it's just personal preference.  One more reason to visit a local astronomy club/meet-up and try some stuff before purchasing anything :-)

.

Even this set will require a few things to get the most out of it. E.g. a book/map and a 6mm eyepiee for planets, a 15mm for deep-sky, preferrably wide angle ($24-$35 "[gold line](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/)", or HR Planetary, BST Explorer, Explore Scientific 82\u00b0)

.

Here you can find a few links on what to expect in different sized telescopes: 

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

The manual dobsonians show a **lot**. But a good finder and map/book are required. "Turn left at Orion" for example to get started. 

For darker locations, a [Telrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) + Maps can make finding nebulae a lot easier than "star-hopping".

.

If you do mostly solar system, a 6" dobsonian (Skywatcher/Telescopes.com, $305) or 5" Maksutov (Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 for $439) can be nice as well, but will limit your results for deep-sky. For some very basic imaging the 127slt can be used, but it's not suited for "serious" astro photography as the mount limits the exposure times and the aperture ratio is too "slow".


.

A 8" or 10" under a dark sky can last a life-time :-) But the telescope you use the most is the best telescope. For me, that's probably the small 5" dobsonian ($199, AWB Onesky). But when I get to observe with my 10", it's awesome.

I also have GoTo mounts for my 4" and 5" telescopes, but I rarely use them. The manual telescopes are quick &amp; simple to set up, and it's not hard to find things manually either. Especially the prominent planets are easy to spot. Also, you can build/buy a EQ Platform for tracking with these dobsonians.Hello,

basically, you would hook up the motors in pairs.

Also, you can buy dual H-Bridge modules for a dollar to control several motors, e.g. 

 - [H-Bridge module at ebay](http://www.ebay.de/itm/L9110S-H-bridge-Stepper-Motor-Dual-DC-motor-Driver-Controller-Board-New-SC-/251786739222?hash=item3a9fa8be16:g:90kAAOSwk5FUr-1e)

You can also build a H-Bridge from transistors/Mosfets.

This way you can measure the speed of each motor/wheel and compensate for differences =&gt; drive a straight line.

Look at the seller/product reviews and ratings. YMMV. You can get all of these locally/nationally but probably for a tad more.Well, we are using the HC-SR04, but basically because it's well documented and only costs $0.70 shipped in single quantities.

You can use multiple or pan it with a small servo. 

The measured distance is not super precise, but enough.Hello,

what are you looking for exactly?

Price-range? Size? What do you want to observe? What kind of mount?

Many telescopes are sold as OTA (Optical tube assembly).Hello,

you can get all of those without a mount ([e.g. here](http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Telescope-Optical-Tube-Assemblies/pc/1/18.uts) or [there](http://www.telescopes.com/pages/search-results?q=sky-watcher%20maksutov&amp;p=1)), but that still leaves a few questions unanswered :-) (how much, what size/weight contrains, ...) 

For deep-sky, aperture is key;

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

Larger Maksutov  &amp; Schmidt-Cassegrain get expensive and despite their short size can be quite bulky, especially with a rigid mount. The closed system needs a longer cool-down time. Their longer focal length results in a smaller field of view compared to other designs, which can be hindersome if you want to do some wide-field observing.

E.g. for $300-$400 you can either get a 6" or 8" dobsonian (or the short Orion Starblast 6), or a 4-5" Maksutov. From 6" up the Catadiopters get even more expensive.

Regarding the 5" Mak, it's available without a mount, but the Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 costs about the same as just the bare telescope from other companies (Both cost ~$440).

The smaller Maks are cheaper (4" $300, 3.5" $145) but show significantly less. They fit on a rigid camera tripod. Larger SC are more common, but for anything over 5" a camera tripod might not be sufficient anymore.

For comparison: A short 5" reflector on a mount starts at around $179.

.

What are your size/weight requirements and how much do you want to spend? Does it have to be a Catadioptric (and why did you choose these)?   Indeed, if you need to put it into the trunk, a 8" Cat will be a compact choice. At $999, including the GoTo mount, it's quite more expensive than a  8" dobsonian ($355-$499).

If you feel comfortable fitting the 8" tube on the back-seat or if you can fit a collapsible/[flextube](http://www.telescopes.com/collections/sky-watcher-collapsible-dobsonians/products/sky-watcher-8-inch-dobsonian-telescope)/Lightbridge in your trunk, that might be a cheaper solution :-)

[8" full tube on back-seat](http://stargazerslounge.com/topic/101219-skywatcher-skyliner-200p-unboxing-building-and-some-add-ons/?p=998392)

[8" Flextube](https://www.facebook.com/AstroPetesCafe/photos/pb.267254009999508.-2207520000.1447049005./981275775263991/?type=3) / [12" Flextube](http://www.opticstar.com/Run/Astronomy/Astro-Telescopes-Skywatcher.asp?p=0_10_1_3_280)

Lightbride truss-tube, 8", [[1]](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VFxlIKtyT3dJ9K60tkSVEQ) 

You get a very similar performance with the 8" dobsonian, it costs half, is a purely and intuitive to use manual telescope. With an adjustable seat, it's pretty comfortable. With one of the flextube/lightbride constructions you might even fit a 12" into your car, that'll [show quite a bit more](http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/visastro/m51-apert/index.html) and fits into your budget, even with accessories.

But a 12", even as collapsible, is quite a cannon  :-) Even with the Lightbride or Flextube it might not fit, so measure.

.

The 8se for example has 2023mm focal length and a 1.25" focuser/diagonal. To get a larger field of view you should ad a 2" kit to use wide-angle overview eyepieces :-)

.


I don't want to give the impression that something like the 8se (or other Cats) are bad, they are great and really more compact. I just wanted to point out the alternatives.

8se size -&gt;

 - [Spock for size](http://jeffyen.blogspot.de/2012/03/celestron-nexstar-8se-computerised.html) ;-)
  
 - http://orange-can.blogspot.de/2012/04/welcome-to-orange-can-astronomy-blog.html

So if you have size constrains, don't mind the smaller field of view and longer cool-down time, something like the 8" cat is amazing :-)

.

Did you want to avoid GoTo because of the cost? Or some other reason?Hello :-)

Baader solar film (visual density) and ThousandOaks solar filter (more natural color but Baader seems better for higher magnifications) are rather cheap and easy for DIY filters. Avoid no-name filters or things like rescue blankets / Mylar sheets.  Covering glass plates /w soot is also dangerous as it will not filter all light bandwidths. This was done a lot a few decades ago, even in schools, and it's not safe. Still a lot of tutorials around that use soot.

Other ways are solar projection (with older, non-cemented eyepiece designs).

Avoid filters that attach to the eyepiece instead of the front aperture. They can be dangerous (the heat might damage the focuser/filter, the filter might even burst).

Glass filters will work too but are more expensive.

Check your filter before every use, even pin-sized holes need to be covered (or replace the filter).

Random tutorial on DIY filter holders: http://www.ozscopes.com.au/Viewing-the-Sun-How-to-Build-A-Solar-Filter-For-TelescopesThat should work :-) Oddly their 76mm filter is cheaper.Hello :-)

Yeah, it's always aperture VS size VS cost :-)

I wanted 12" initially, but it's just large and expensive.

I settled for a 10kg/22lbs ultra light 10" dobsonian in the end, but it's less ready-to-run ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/sum1.jpg)/[2](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/sum2.jpg)).

Right now I use a smaller telescope the most, as it's quicker to set up and I can transport it in a back-pack. 

Indeed, GoTo has a couple of down-sides, the manual is more complex than some telescope starter guides :-) But at least mounts like the Celestron Nexstar have "Auto alignment" and for visual it's enough to use one star alignment as well.

With the 2000mm focal length and a 1.25" focuser, you can reach around 0.5\u00b0 field of view. 

With a 2" adapter / diagonal (e.g. [this](http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/info/p682_komplettkit-2--38mm-70--erfle-----2--99--diel--zenitspiegel.html)) you can reach up to 1.5\u00b0 field of view.

With a 8" dobsonian, typically 1200mm, you can reach around 2\u00b0 field of view (or a bit more) [depending on the eyepiece](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg). 

(With a 5"F/5 3.5\u00b0, 6"F/5 2.6\u00b0)


A larger field of view will make it easier to get orientated. Of course, with GoTo, this is less of a problem (When it's aligned&amp;set up).

Some objects such as the Plejads, the Andromeda galaxy, NGC7000 and other DSO have a huge apparent size. They are even a bit too big for the larger dobsonians. But you could take some binoculars along. Many objects are small, though, so they are fine for the larger Cat. :-)

Here a collage I found via Google image search that shows a few different larger objects. The 200/2000 with 1.25" and 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl would show almost exactly the field of view equal to the full moon:

 - http://i.imgur.com/paS4vuQ.jpg

 - Many nabulae and clusters will be smaller.

.

One thing I just thought of: Note that some GoTo AltAz mounts require power in order to move the telescope, as pushing them will damage the gears. So if this is an issue, you could consider a manual (EQ) mount.Personally I like the Telrad.

A few links for the Telrad

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9

It makes it so easy with the right maps.

The amount of stars in the optical finder can be irritating at first. Under light polluted skies a optical finder is the way to go, as you need enough visible stars to align the Telrad circles.

Then the 8x50 RACI.Congratulations on your new Telescope :-) That's the best choice for your budget. 

Did you get any accessories (Turn left at Orion, eyepieces)? 

Clear skies! Hello :-)

In order to build small telescopes with children I tried different things.

A shaving/cosmetic mirror can work, but it's very, very poor. The optical precision in those is not high, as they only need to magnify 3x or so.. They are also not first-surface, meaning the mirror coating is on the back of the mirror, behind the glass. Telescope mirrors are front-surface.

If you want to try anyway, get a small mirror ("dentist mirror" for example) as secondary. That's another horrible mirror, but it'll work for a first try.

Get a shaving mirror with the longest focal length possible. Put it on the ground, and move your face away from it. The moment the image "flips", you've discovered it's focal length. The longer the focal length, the more likely it'll work at all. A longer focal length, the closer the spherical shape will be to a [parabolic one](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sphericalAb1.png).

I tried three mirrors or so. One was capable of showing me the moon at around 10x magnification or so, but there where ghost images (due to the glass over the mirror surface there where reflections) and it was not possible to get it very sharp.

Another cheaper mirror I tried was so bad nothing was recognizable.

.

If you really want to build something that'll work, consider getting a 114/900 mirror. You can sometimes get these cheap at Surplusshed. If not, check for used telescopes on craigslist and ebay. Some sell these 114/900 for &lt;$50. Don't get the short 114/900 or 127/1000, they are bird-jones telescopes that use an additional lens and are often of poor quality.

.

Parabolic: Telescopes with a very long focal length compared to their aperture do not need to be parabolic. A 114/900 or a 150/1200 don't have to be parabolic. The "slow" aperture ratio is enough to make these telescopes deliver a diffraction limited image.

.

Another option is to grind your own mirror. But that is a LOT of work :-) Also the materials might cost more than buying a small to medium mirror. Typically this only makes sense if you want to build a very big telescope or want a specific mirror or quality. Or just because you can :-)

.

Oh, there's also the Astromedia (Europe) "cardboard newtonian". I've build one of those and gave one away as gift. It's a neat set and actually works pretty well. It has a small, real mirror (70/450).

http://www.astromediashop.co.uk/Telescopes.html

But any 76/700 telescope will outperform it. Those 76/700  sometimes sell for $10-$20 used. This is how I got started with the hobby ;-) But the mount of those sets are often way to shaky. Building  a small dobsonian rockerbox is simple to do and can enhance the experience quickly. The build can be [pretty](https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/) or [quick&amp;dirty](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg) ($5).This :-)

The Orion Skyscanner 4" could fit the requirement. AND something like the 7x50 Celestron Cometron binoculars :-)

The 3" table tops are pretty limited. 

There are a few other $100 choices, though the telescope that are a bit more expensive perform much better. Consider a Celestron c90 if she is interested in planets.

I was going to recommend the Meade Polaris 130eq as compromise but it's price increased in the last weeks.

Also see a recent post of mine (which, sadly, was blocked by the spam filter)

http://pastebin.com/RWLSGRfL

If you are handy, you could build a "rockerbox" for the Celestron 114 900 EQ ($110 shipped).

Where are you from? You could look for a used one in good shape. I looked at a few random adds in Oklahoma; Nothing spectacular (without knowing what area you are from it didn't make sense to look intensively), but you can get a few cheap ones such as  [this](https://oklahomacity.craigslist.org/for/5319509486.html) (though the mount isn't ideal) and [that](http://texoma.craigslist.org/for/5322500478.html).The AWB is a great entry level telescope!

Regarding the Orion Observer, there's also the cheaper 70az

But of course the smaller aperture shows less.

As mentioned in my other post, the Orion Skyscanner 100 can be neat for wide-field. It has a bit more aperture, is not ideal for planets though.

Also, Aperture:

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622
It does, I discovered a used AstroZoom a few years back and it performs quite well;

http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?

Many modern eyepieces have a barlow-like element built-in to increase the magnification while keeping the eye relief long enough.

If you take a regular barlow and increase the distance to the eyepiece, the magnification will increase as well.

Some Barlows even sell as dual power 1.4x and 2x, depending on how you attach them.

 - http://www.ebay.com/itm/All-Metal-2X-Telescope-Multi-coated-eyepiece-Barlow-Lens-w-T-thread-Dual-power-/331168524916?hash=item4d1b2eaa74:g:tSEAAMXQydtTPIQj

The nice thing is that the apparent field of view will not get as small as the wide-range zooms (7-21 or 8-24mm zooms that get from 60\u00b0 down to 40\u00b0).

The silver barrel is 1.25" and should fit in some film cans. But I suppose the hardware store is a better alternative anyway.

My worries where that the film can isn't truly black/matte, but it worked so well I was amazed. The only issue, at least with the Heritage, is the short back-focus required me to slide in the flex-tube a bit as the film can will cover part of the barrel so it does not fit into the focuser as deep anymore.500 dollarss will buy you an amazing telescope.

E.g. the z8 

 -  http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope

or even z10 ($499),

though you should ad at least ad a decent eye relief 6mm eyepiece for planets 

 - e.g http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/

...and perhaps the 15mm for deep-sky.


.

The Zhumell are a great deal as they include a 2" wide angle eyepiece worth $70 alone, a dual speed focuser, right angle finder scope, laser collimator, moon filter and so on. The SkyWatcher 8" $315 is not bad either but does not have most of these accessories. The Orion XT8 costs just a bit less than the z8 and does not even have a decent finder for such a big telescope.

I've posted the link on how important aperture is;

Here's one with telescope sizes;

 - http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html

The 8" will still fit on the back-seat.

.

Can you see the milky way from your observing location?

What would you like to observe most?

Keep in mind only three planets show noteworthy surface details and aren't always up. So getting  a telescope to show you some deep-sky is always worth  considering.

What kind of robot? How cheap?

It's possible to build [these](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Tracing-car-box-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Send-the-Battery-Box-For/32291913537.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.117.xk4EqF&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_1) for $[15](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3umf0c/beginner_project_that_doesnt_require_soldering/cxg438k)

You can sometimes get the 2wd kits for under $8 at Aliexpress and for $13 or so at Amazon.

It's possible to build even cheaper ones, e.g. a piece of wood, two $1.20 servos modified for continuous rotation, Digispark or Arduino Mini, and a 8-cent TCRT5000 reflective sensor for close proximity or line following, &lt;$5.

 Hello :-)

Kwtelescope has the xt8 the cheapest, but you need to call them about availability. There have been a few cases on here where people just ordered it and nothing happened at first until they investigated.

http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html


The kit accessories are very basic. Don't get the Plus version though as you can buy much better  accessories separately.
(Skywatcher 8" is more expensive but has a better finder, Zhumell z8 is not available over there)

Also consider the q70 32mm wide angle eyepiece for a better overview.

maisonastronomie has the 6mm (for planets) wide angle ("gold line") the cheapest in canada afaik. The eyepiece performs much better than combining the kit eyepice with a  Barlow (double magnification)
 and shows a larger apparent field of view, too. Also the eye relief is better than cheaper Pl\u00f6ssl-type eyepieces.

Also "Turn left at Orion" is a must.

Better finder, a 15mm gold line, a chair with adjustable height  (ironing chair) are recommended but not mandatory.Hi :-)

The Heritage 130p is great. It's one of the better telescopes in this price-range. It has a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but overall it's neat.

Similar telescopes on an equatorial mount (Meade Polaris 130eq or Celestron 130eq) are not bad either, but the mount shakes a lot which can be tedious when focusing &amp; tracking objects.

If you can stretch your budget a little, there's the xt8. KWtelescope has it the cheapest

 - http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html

But call regarding availability as I've read about two cases on here where people ordered it and then nothing happened until they investigated.

Aperture is key; A 8" can last a life-time;

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

That said, I use the 5" more as it's so light and portable, and easily set up even on the narrow balcony.Probably not exactly what you where looking for, but check out

Hello :-)


&gt; what are some important things I should know? 

If you are from the US, consider the Zhumell z8 (much better accessories, the 2" wide angle eyepiece is worth $70 alone, dual speed focuser, right angle 8x50 finder, collimation tool, moon filter...)

The SkyWatcher 8" is cheaper ($315) than the xt8  and the Skywatcher has a better finder.

In Canada it's a bit different (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/3uz1fh/best_website_to_buy_telescope_from_dobsonian_6or/cxj2e9j))


.

Most telescope's accessories are very basic.

Consider

 - A 2" wide-angle eyepiece  for a [better overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) (at least [this](http://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html) or [the 30mm80\u00b0](http://www.universityoptics.com/2inch.html))

 - A  6mm [wide angle](http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png) with decent eye relief (More than 200x magnification is possible, but atmospheric seeing limits what you can see) (e.g. [the Gold line](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/) which are the no name variant of the Orion Expanse)

 - One or two in-between (e.g. 15mm gold line)

 - Turn left at Orion - the missing manual :-) And a dim red light. Preserves night vision better, doesn't only show you where to find objects, but how to observe, what to expect and what's worthwhile observing.

 - Chair /w Adjustable height, e.g. Ironing chair

 - Collimation tool (optional but recommended, [$0-$20](http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165)+)

 - Moon filter ($0 sun glasses, $5 color filter $20+ for a neutral density or adjustable polarization filter).A 2" wide angle lens is a [good thing](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) to have (such as Explore Scientific 30mm 70\u00b0 or SWAN 33mm or  University Optics 30mm 80\u00b0* or GSO 30mm65\u00b0, all these are in the ~$70-$100 price range.) Under dark skies, up to 36mm can be used. Under some light pollution, 30-33mm is more usable. Under heavily polluted skies perhaps even just 24-30mm.

6mm Gold line ($35 US, $24 China) for planets for example, (more magnification is possible but atmospheric seeing limits it most of the time) at least on a budget while wanting something decent. *For someone mostly interested in planets* this one will actually be more important than wide-field :-)

Moon filter-&gt; Sun glasses, $4 color filter, or all-out and get a  variable polarization filter :-)


Single-speed focuser: You can live with it. The dual speed is more convenient.  

---


*
*This one has a larger apparent field of view but the sharpness degrades at the outer field of view*Hello,

depends on what eyepiece - Wide angle for a better overview, deep-sky / mid range, high magnification?

What are your observation targets (deep-sky, planets), how did you decide on this telescope?

If you can stretch your budget a bit, Explore Scientific 82 or perhaps the slightly cheaper [Luminos](http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93432-Luminos-Eyepiece-Silver/dp/B00113NQAQ). 82\u00b0 is very nice. But of course the budget [gold-line](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/) are fine too.

Keep in mind the 6se has a very small field of view with the standard 1.25" diagonal you can only reach a field of view of around 1\u00b0 or so.

Possible set-up

 - A 2" diagonal + 36-46mm Wide angle eyepiece could be nice.


 - For deep-sky, an exit pupil of 2-3mm is ideal, multiply by the aperture ratio, and you'll get a 20-30mm eyepiece. So basically the kit eyepiece covers that, though of course there are better ones.

 - A 7mm eyepiece will give you ~214x. More is possible, but only occasionally (due to the atmospheric seeing limiting it). Less is more sometimes :-)
 
 -  Ideally something filling the gap, e.g. 10-12mm.Beats me.  :-)

Well, orion has seems to have excellent support. The XT Dobsonians are sold from more stores. I believe the Orion dobsonians have been around longer, too.

Skywatcher is more popular in Europe (and GSO), while Orion' dobsonian are not as common. 

Recently the Zhumell dobsonians have been out of stock a lot (thankfully it's on back-order now, so it seems it'll be back soon).Hello,

what's portable for you? Backpack, Car?

The telescope has GoTo, so the small field of view is not so problematic for finding things. Some objects with larger apparent size won't fit into the view (Andormeda, NGC7000, Plejads and so on).

A 2" diagonal + 2" eyepiece could provide you with views of ~2\u00b0 Field. But it's not required.

If you just want to observe planets, you don't need to get away from light pollution.

.

If you have a car and you need to get away from light pollution, and your main targets are deep-sky-objects, you could still consider a larger telescope that'll show more and still fits into a car. I am not saying that you should not choose the 6se, that's just my two cents on the subject :-)

Of course a  8" xt8i or xt8g $660/$1050 are not cheap either. But depending on what you are trying to do GoTo is not all that necessary. Something like "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo-Manual and you'll need to know a few basics anyway. Then finding objects yourself is no big deal, and a manual $300-$400 telescope shows more than the smaller 6SE.

 The Planets that show noteworthy surface details are so bright they can be spotted by the naked eye if you know what direction to look in, and with a decent finder-scope finding deep-sky objects is not all that difficult either. I have both GoTo and Manual telescopes, and mostly use the manual one. Quick, easier, shows more :-) 
A dobsonian is not neccessarily a table-top mount, only the 4" and 5". The 8" dobsonian is high enough to comfortably observe while seated.

The "traditional" mounts/tripods aren't bad or anything, but the companies sell way too small ones with the telescopes in the typical bundles. Because a rigid (equatorial) mount can cost more than the telescope. E.g. a 114/900 reflector should go on a NEQ3/CG4 mount, and not a EQ2 or even EQ1. The problem: The NEQ3 or similar costs more than the telescope: $260-$300 (without the telescope!), while the same telescope costs $110 on an EQ1 as bundle...

The dobsonian got so popular as the base is cheap AND rigid, which means less compromises for visual observations.

The 5" is lower to the ground. Something like [[this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60178887/)] is a cheaper and sturdier solution than getting a 5" on a weak equatorial mount. It's highly portable as well. Of course it's [not perfect](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but one of the better choices in this price-range.&gt; do what galleio and point that beast up.

(Was going to add sun glasses but it was too much :-) )No apologies necessary :-) That's what this forum is there for :-)

Have you decided on a telescope yet, or do you need other options (smaller, cheaper, day-time use, etc.? What does he want to observe, planets and/or deep-sky?)

The 8" is the best bang for the buck, can last for years, but it's not perfect for everybody. You mean like in the link (http://arduinobasics.blogspot.de/2013/01/arduino-basics-sonar-project-tutorial.html)?

.

Or this but  with US?

http://www.fuzzyhypothesis.com/?p=5105

-&gt; The sound spreads so it's not possible to get good readings. In some tutorials they build what they called a "lens"  to focus the US (more of a funnel to direct the sound), but everything that the US bounces off causes inaccuracies. 

http://www.matthewstyer.com/sonarimaging/ ("I purchased a rangefinder with the narrowest advertised beam I could find")



.

Or more like the medical ultrasonic pictures? There you see a cross section of something, not sure if that's possible with the US modules you can typically buy for the Arduino...

http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=15937.0Well, the *bang for your buck* would be the 8" dobsonian ([Aperture](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)...), but it's of course a bit over the budget :-)

Still, the 5" is a fun entry level telescope with an additional eyepiece or two.You can attach wheels or buy a wheeled platform for dobsonians. The Flextubes are not necessarily lighter, just more compact.

How far does it have to be moved?Hello :-)

1- [What to expect to see](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) - 10"&lt;&gt;12" won't be a big difference when compared directly, but for deep-sky, every bit helps.

2- How far? 12" can usually be handled alone, but it is big;  [Montage](http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html)

3- A 2" wide angle eyepiece (~aud$100-$400+) for a [larger overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg), and one for ~200x magnification with long eye relief (~aud$40-50). More is possible, but atmospheric seeing often limits what's possible to under 250x. Collimation tool, filters optional. A good book/map for your side of this planet :-)
How old is it? Do you have a picture?

What is your budget, what does it cost? If it costs more than the 6 or 8 Skywatcher ($275/$315) I'd reconsider.

7" is very unusual, did the owner perhaps measure the outer diameter?That even binoculars and small telescopes can show so much (galaxies, clusters, planets). That you can pick up radio waves from Jupiter with a multi-band radio and long wires.

Even with all the TV-Shows and internet resources there are sill a lot of misconceptions among children; At the school I work at the top misconceptions usually are

 - We've been to other planets
 
 - The solar system is basically all there is in the universe

 - Aliens where already discovered
 
 - Jupiter is as big as the sun (thanks to not-to-scale art)
 
 - What orbits around what

 - You need an expensive telescope to see "far" into space  

 - Moon is  a planet

 - moon's apparent size

 - Seasons are caused by the elliptical orbit

 - Sun != Star

If you tell them that you can see other galaxies or the moons of Jupiter in binoculars, or show them how big the universe is in relation to our solar system, how "slow" our space travel is, a few minds are usually blown. Tell them to cover the moon with a finger to see how small it's apparent size really is. Let them play in Stellarium and discover nebulae and galaxies.

Always on a no-budget, I've built the space-time simulator with them (Idea from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg), a "Doppler effect ropeway" through the class room, [reading glasses telescopes](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/lesebrillen-teleskop/) to show them how telescopes work in principle, [CD-Spectrometer](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=461), Planet paper models, I 3d printed Mars with an enhanced structure (from Thingiverse) for them to feel the surface, built sun-goggles out of Baader Solar foil for the eclipse, and bought a bunch of used $10-$50 telescope to build dobsonians out of them. It does not need a lot of money to do some space-stuff at school, but it's a lot of work and day-time topics are limited :-) A lot of things are on-hold currently (miniature planetarium, Radio telescope...). Doing somethign with their own hands helps them learn and remember. Things like bottle rockets are not overly scientific, but it does get the whole point about thrust across and isn't as borring as just learning about how rockets work on paper.Hello :-)

YES! ;-)

And it's not that expensive if you can wait a while:

It's fun to build autonomous robots (car kits start at $10 or so), get the ~$2 ESP8266 Wifi module, all kind of sensors and components. You can build pen plotters, automate your home or just explore the Software-side, even make games (e.g. Gamebuino).

Parts 

https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874

There are many great tutorials, Instructables and so on out there. This. Sparkfun has a few nice things too. My SO is into technology and knitting, and it's a great way to get those interests together.

It's not really sexist, in the 5th grade a lot of boys where into the idea of wearables when I suggested projects. I think we are past that... hopefully. Wearables are just a great, geeky thing to explore  :-)Hello,

depending on what project ideas you have you can take off in different directions. But do start with some simple things first. I have started with a small robot, but had previous programming experience.

Do you have previous experience with programming and electronics?

In general a kit is a good idea, especially if you have not.

If you aren't in a rush, check out the Chinese kits such as [this one](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062). Banggood and ebay have similar ones.

Otherwise check out Sparkfun and Adafruit, and of course the official Arduino starter kit. 

 - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060

 - https://www.adafruit.com/products/68

 - https://store.arduino.cc/product/GKX00007

.


The down-side of the Chinese kits is usually not part quality, but the lack of a good tutorial. The components are all standard stuff though and you'll find examples on the Arduino website or Instructables for example.

You'll still need a good book/guide. There are a lot of resources (For example: [1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH
) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) [5](http://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-free-book-for-beginners/)).

While the kits come with almost everything you need, consider a few spare $2.80 Arduino Uno compatibles (typically require different drivers but work well), $1-$2 breadboards and [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874); For example a 2wd robot chassis for $10, a H-Bridge motor driver and ultrasonic sensor for under a dollar each. Also a selection of Resistors and other common parts.

Also consider a multimeter (even a $4 will do for low current/low voltage tasks), a soldering iron (a adjustable soldering station for $20+ would be best). A decent soldering iron makes it much easier; I started with a cheap one and used to hate soldering :-) There are modules you just hook up with dupont cables, but the connections aren't always reliable.

Depending on previous experience you could grab a copy of "Getting started in electronics" (fun to read, not only for children, easy and still gives you a impression of the "inner workings" of electronics). Or practical electronics for inventors. Written well, not too complicated, but also includes a lot of important math and formulas. While the Arduino tutorials will cover some basics (resistors, current) it helps to understand a bit more about what's going on.http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Ultrasonic-Module-HC-SR04-Distance-Measuring-Transducer-Sensor-HC-SR04-HCSR04-ultrasonic-transducer-ultrasonic-sensor/32509315720.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.JtRu7W&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_1

I just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3v53ns/want_to_get_started_with_arduino_but_not_really/cxkcrui) with a few resources, perhaps you can find something useful.I used an $2 ESP8266 Wifi and browser-interface or Roboremo. Not as power efficient as bluetooth, but longer range / remote from any network.Since when? Try importing a laser to Germany... :-)Hello :-)

A Telescope is a very personal matter, so take some time to answer the questions at the end of this post. Here some general suggestions.

.

**Telescope suggestions**

**AWB Onesky**

The AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p outside the US) is a great starter telescope. It has a few [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) but overall it's one of the better entry level sets, due to the fact that most entry level telescopes around or under $200 come on a much to weak tripod, that will make focusing and tracking objects tedious.

It's also portable, easy to handle by a kid. It's of course not indestructible, but at 8 you can teach a child to take care of it, what to touch and what not to touch, and as it's center of gravity is low it can't just be tipped over either (and it can handle a bit of beating, it's more rigid than it might look).

**Larger dobsonian**

For your budget you can also get a 6" or even 8" dobsonian. It offers the best bang for the buck, is rigid and easy to use.

**Telescope types, others**

A 8 year old will be able to use a dobsonian quicker than a equatorial mount. The dobsonian offers the best bang for the buck, as the mount is cheap yet rigid. 

A small spotting scope (Celestron c90) on a rigid camera tripod can be nice too as it has an upright image and fits even in a smaller backpack (while the AWB fills out a larger backpack by itself). The c90 smaller aperture is the limiting factor though.

You can also get a few nice small refractors in your budget, but the mounts are often not ideal in the sets. 
It's difficult to suggest more telescopes without knowing a few more details.

.

**Stuff to buy**

Do not forget about accessories, e.g. a eyepiece for planets, $[24](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Ultra-Wide-Multi-Coated-6mm-Eyepiece-Lens-for-Telescope-For-Hunting-Free-Shipping-Telescope-Binoculars/32355663118.html)-[35](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/).

"Simple stargazing" or "Turn left at Orion" - A good book/map is crucial to use the telescope. The included manual does not address finding objects, and compared to an App, TLAO teaches you how to observe, where to find objects, what to expect.

Binoculars. For younger children they are easier to use and show a lot (A bunch of galaxies, nebulae, clusters, phases of Venus, moons of Jupiter). A lower power is easier to hold free-handed. Good binoculars cost much, but there are some decent budget solutions (e.g. Celestron Cometron 7x50 $35). 10x or higher magnification is difficult/impossible to hold free handed, the wide field of 6x-8x is easier to handle. I don't recommend binoculars as only tool for kids (as they are usually interested in planets), but they are a great tool in *addition*. :-)

Foot stool for your kid depending on the telescope size, and/or an adjustable height chair (ironing chair).

.


**Stuff to avoid**

Eyepiece kits (overpriced, mediocre, redundant), Zoom eyepieces (narrow apparent field of view on one side of the setting), "Bird-jones" telescopes (newtonian reflectors much shorter than their focal length, which have quality and collimation issues).

.

**Choosing**

Only Jupiter, Saturn and Mars show noteworthy surface details (and aren't always visible). So considering a telescope with enough aperture to show some deep-sky details is always worth considering. 

A 8" can last a life-time. While most galaxies and nebulae appear as faint smudges in smaller telescopes, a 8" can show the spiral structure of a bunch of galaxies under dark skies.

But sometimes portability or another aspect is more important. I use my 5" much more recently than the larger one... Yet I would not give away the bigger one, if I get a chance to use it, it's magnificent.


.

**Questions**

Can you see the milky way from your location? Where do you want to observe? (Deep-sky needs dark skies, Planets don't)

How important is portability? How will you transport it?

Is there a local astronomy club / society / observatory / meet-up
 around? You should check, a lot of helpful folks and you might get a chance to look at different telescopes :-)

What area are you from? Perhaps there's a used offer.
  Hello again :-)

I had mostly done PHP &amp; AS when I got started with Arduino. For me it was pretty easy to grasp, even without an official guide.

If you know Javascript and have a understaning of what IF/ELSE does, what variables are, you should be fine with a random kit and book or tutorials. That road can have a few bumps though :-) 

Javascript does a lot of things differently, microcontrollers are a bit different than programming computers/websites, but the same logic applies.

 If you can afford one of the starter kits, it will be a bit easier of course.

.

If you have some basic knowledge of circuits, resistors, transistors, LED, current and voltage, it should be no problem for you to start with some breadboard + parts. The tutorials will cover everything you have to know to build the examples; But it never hurts to expand on that.


 As teenager I got "Getting started in electronics", and despite it's simplicity, I still have it around as it's such an easy read while really bringing the basics across.

.

The Kit from Aliexpress is the best bang for the buck. It has a lot of standard components, and probably 99% of those most tutorials or books use. 

Take a look at the tutorials I posted links to and see what's missing... Basically the ultrasonic sensor and perhaps a few resistors/MOSFET and a breadboard power supply are the main differences.

A wall-wart, USB charger [Or something like this](
http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-pcs-MB102-Breadboard-Power-Supply-Module-3-3V-5V-For-Solderless-Bread-Board-hot-new/32499340254.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.33.hVQ4RR&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_1) as the Arduino can't power motors for example.If you already know a bit of Arduino programming, check out [this](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32223449258.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.202.DDeBvg&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_1) or [this kit](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062).

Also some ESP8266 Wifi modules ($1.80-$2.70, e.g. esp-01 or esp-201) can be nice. And of course a few Arduino Nano or Uno compatibles to spare ($1.80-$2.70)

Hello again :-)

**SLT**

The 130 SLT costs $399 at Amazon and the 127 SLT $420 at Amazon.

I have the SLT mount and similar telescopes (smaller Maksutov, similar reflector).

The GoTo function and tracking is nice. It's a neat gadget. But you will need to know a few basics about the night sky anyway, and then it's easy to find objects manually. "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the Computer control's manual.


GoTo isn't always as easy as it may sound, and it leaves less money for the actual optics. The SLT is a nice gadget, but I mostly use my manual telescope. It's easier &amp; quicker to set-up. 


So GoTo is not necessarily the easy way, if that's the motivation. It can be;  Though you'll also find a lot of forum threads with titles such as: "Alignment problems- Help!", "Aligned, but not aligned", "SLT Mak failing to Align", "Accuracy problems" (acual topic titles from random Google results on goto alignment problems) 
 ;-) 

.

**Manual finding VS GoTo**

The planets that show surface details are even visible to the naked eye if you know the general direction or use an App. Tracking them manually with a wide-angle eyepiece isn't difficult either.

A computerized 5" will show much less than a 8" while costing the same or more.

Also you kind of get tempted to hop from object to object with a computerized GoTo mount. Finding your objects yourself can be rewarding, you'll observe it longer and will discover more details if you keep looking at it.

If you ever run into problems finding objects with book/maps, there are always apps that show you where to point your phone/telescope to, such as Night Sky Tools. Even with a cheap last-generation &lt;$50 outdoor smartphone and a deep red transparency sheet to truly preserve night-vision it'll still be a lot cheaper and easier in my opinion.

Apps will even show circles of the field of view of your eyepiece or finder, and books do as well. Just align&amp;look, instead of waiting for the slow-ish GoTo motor to move the telescope.

.

Personally, for deep-sky, I like the [Telrad/Rigel](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) finder.

.

**GoTo for a kid**

I don't know if a 8 year old can handle the Nexstar without your help; The set-up is a bit tedious at times, especially if you have an obstructed view of the sky. You will have to move the motors in a specific direction to avoid the back-slash/play issue of the motor gears. Setting up time and location is also required.

A dobsonian, despite it's simplicity, is just placed on the ground and then you can look up right away. No need for alignment, no slow motors and so on.

Oh, and the SLT mount is dependent on batteries or electricity.  You can move it with the arrow keys, but not push it manually as it'll damage the geared system.

**Learning**
 
Learning about the night sky and the lore is part of the fun IMHO, for everything else there is "Stellarium"* :-)

A lot of objects can be underwhelming for a child, especially in a 5" telescope. The whole experience of searching, exploring, and learning about what you are actually looking at in a book is more valuable.

**Go to GoTo**

If you insist on GoTo and expand your budget, the 127SLT is nice for planets. The 130slt is nice for wide-field. Of course it works for planets as well but the short reflector is not as good for higher magnifications. A 6" or 8" dobsonian will beat both.

They are nice, compact, ideal for porch or balcony. But as you said you want something that does not need to be replaced/upgraded in a few years, the larger manual telescope could be the better choice.

For a higher budget there's also the Sky-Watcher 8 Goto or  xt8g, or the 6se.


**Used**

...could not find overly great deals at CL, only a few $50 budget scopes.

**Observing location**

Sounds good. Can you see the milky way?

What observing targets are you / is he interested in?

----

*
*(free for PC/Mac, cheap for the phone, http://stellarium.org)*Did you check the links to telescopes?

The Zhumell z8 is a much better deal as it's one of the few sets with a much better 

 - overview eyepiece, 

 - dual speed focuser 

 - and right angle finder.

The only thing really missing for the z8 is the 6mm "gold line" or similar long eye relief eyepiece. For the Orion or Skywatcher dobsonian you'll need to buy a overview eyepiece as well and consider a better finder, and you're stuck with the simpler focuser and other accessories.

.

The 8" collapsible flex-tube is not really all that beneficial. The open structure is vulnerable to stray light and some of the collapsible are even heavier than the full tubes. Also the sky-watcher full tube is cheaper - but as said, the z8 offers more for your money. It's on back-order (but at least it's finally back as it was sold out for a while).


.

If you insist on ordering from Amazon, consider the [SW 8"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z4G3PRK?keywords=skywatcher%20dobsonian&amp;qid=1449088893&amp;ref_=sr_1_8&amp;sr=8-8) (edit: out of stock though :-( ) so you have some cash to spare for eyepieces.Well, in that case go for the skywatcher then, perhaps the 8" will come back as it recently restocked in the other stores :) i'd get the collapsible over the xt8 probably but you will need a light shroud if there's direct light around.
The z8 offers the better accessories, so for the skywatcher, get a 2" wide angle and the 6mm, a collimation cap, if you want I can look up links on Amazon tomorrow.Hello :-)

Yes, here in Europe Sky-Watcher and GSO are more common. The GSO telescopes are decent.

Of course nothing's perfect. E.g. the small altitude bearings. 

Bresser produces new 8" with large altitude bearrings, but no clue if they will make a 12". 

12" is amazing for visual use. [Aperture is key](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).


Oddly that store lists the "normal" Dobson 300C with the 2" 30mm Erfle eyepiece as well, so the main difference would be the dual speed focuser.

.

**Eyepieces**

At F/5 the 30mm Erfle will not be sharp to the outer field, but it's OK-ish to get started. A better performer is the Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 eyepiece, but it costs quite a bit. 

The overview eyepiece aside, you should consider a few other eyepieces as well. The 9mm will give you 166x. For planets a bit more is nice to have, and a wide-angle eyepiece makes tracking easier at higher magnification. Over 200-250x only works when atmospheric seeing-conditions allow. A 6mm 66\u00b0 "Gold line" is a cheap solution, though of course the Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 are much nicer and good performers at F/5. Their smaller eyepieces aren't quite as expensive as their 2".

Another solution is the "[Astro-Zoom](http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=astrozoom&amp;min=0&amp;max=0)"; While wide-range zooms have some flaws (the apparent field of view gets smaller on one side of the range) the Astrozoom's afov stays constant. With the zoom you can adjust the maximum magnification to the currently possible.

A 10-15mm eyepiece which gives you an exit-pupil (diameter of the lightbeam exiting the eyepice) of 2-3mm at F/5 is ideal for many deep-sky observations.


3-4 good eyepieces can go a long way. Don't get an eyepiece set (mediocre, redundant, overprices) or wide-range zoom (narrow apparent field of view on one side of the scale).


.

**Other things**

Good book/maps. A dim red light to preserve night vision.

I don't understand why they don't sell a RACI finder (right angle correct image) with the deluxe sets. For deep-sky under dark skies a [Telrad/Rigel](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) Finder is nice.

A collimation tool is required. While laser collimator makes it easy, the cheap ones are often not that great. The better ones cost \u20ac80. Though you can also collimate a telescope for 0-30\u20ac (film can, \u20ac4 collimation cap, \u20ac20 cheshire...). See http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165


An adjustable chair (e.g. ironing chair).


Moon filter as it's overly bright (budget: sun-glasses). Nebulae-Filter if you focus on DSO observing (but they only work for certain types and you get what you pay for).

Alibaba/Aliexpress is a huge platform. It's similar to ebay, so it depends on the sellers.

Skywatcher's full tube 8" is out of stock at Amazon. The Flextube's in stock.

The choice of eyepieces is a bit limited at Amazon. In general it makes more sense to buy a telescope at a astronomy store. Depending on what coupons you have, you might just get the accessories there, and buy the telescope at Telescopes.com for example. The better accessories of the z8 will save you a bit of money, too, as you don't have to purchase a 2" wide angle overview eyepiece and the moon filter.

Budget-budget: Sun-glasses.

 - Sky Glow filters: Limited effect. Driving out helps a lot more. IMHO not required
 
 - Nebula filters: You get what you pay for. Great to enhance the contrast for certain nebula types, but optional; OIII, UHC Filters for example.
Pretty when star gazing :-)Hi :-)

Check out the sticky at /r/telescopes.

A telescope can be a very personal matter (size/portability, observing targets...) but in general [a larger aperture will show more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

So while $500 will get you a computerized telescope, more money goes towards the electronics than the actual optics, and the telescope will show less.

For $420 you can get the Celestron Nexstar 127 SLT and one or two eyepieces. But a manual 8" dobsonian will beat it in every discipline, and costs $315 to $[399 with better accessories](http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope).

You could even get the z10 (though consider size* and eyepieces)..

I have a Celestron SLT GoTo telescope and I rarely use it. Yes, it's a neat gadget, yes, tracking is nice, but it'll show less and takes longer to set up.

A dobsonian might be simple, but the base is rigid and intuitive to use. With wide-angle eyepieces (Start at around $30) tracking is not a big deal either.

Even with GoTo you will have to know a bit about the night sky in case there's a problem. "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo manual... and after reading TLAO you can find objects yourself easily. Especially the planets that show noteworthy surface details are easy to spot as they are visible as very bright stars by the naked eye.

In case you do get lost, there are many apps to help you out and - since they all have motion sensors - literally show you where to point your telescope at. Even a last-generation &lt;$50 smartphone will do, if you don't have one. Just make sure to slap a deep red transparency sheet onto the display to preserve night-vision better, at least for deep-sky observations,

Getting a larger aperture is always worth considering, as only three planets show noteworthy surface details and aren't up all the time.

Can you see the milky way from your location? Do you want / are you willing to transport your telescope? What do you want to observe?

Hello :-) Build a rockerbox;

https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/

http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg

It's actually not that tasking. Cheap and fun.I've built a couple of rockerboxes with students for used/refurbished telescopes I bought for school workshops. I got some for $10-$50, also similar ones to yours (125mm F/7.2). 

The result are the shabby green rockerboxes from my second link ;-) But it had to be cheap and easy to build, and each rockerbox ended up costing only $5, while being much more stable than the ultra-flimsy tripods some of these came on.

&gt; I like the way larger objects look through that

Can you elaborate? Because of the larger field of view thanks to the shorter focal length? Does the 8" have a 2" focuser by the way? 

Is the smaller a 114/900 or a shorter one?This :-) 

[Aperture (annd a dark sky) is key](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) for deep-sky observations. If you can fit it into the car (measure, it's big :-)   [[1]](http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html) [2](http://www.zudensternen.de/Teleskop_Skywatcher_Collapsible_Dobson%20305_1500.html) [3](http://www.iceinspace.com.au/41-410-0-0-1-0.html)) a 12" will be awesome and last a life time.


There's nothing wrong with a smaller 8" or 10"; Or a [Flextube](http://www.telescopes.com/products/sky-watcher-12-inch-dobsonian-telescope) (though those have a few flaws and less accessories, plus it costs more).

A good wide-angle eyepiece for planets and mid-range helps getting the most out of the telecope. There's something for every budget-range (e.g. the $35 wide angle "gold-line" from Corvus optics, or the Explore Scientific 82\u00b0 ultra wide angle).

The Zhumell finders are good, a [Telrad/Rigel](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) can be nice under dark skies;
 
It comes with basic moon filter, laser collimation tool and so on, but do get "Turn left at Orion" or similar, as a good map/book is key for using it &amp; finding things.Hehe :-) The green ones where made with cheap construction wood, self-tapping screws, plumbing pipe end covers, furniture gliders and laminate flooring. For ~5" that still works well.

 - http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//dob_fachw9a_1b.png

 - http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/simplesimplemount.jpg

 - http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//minidob_3d_sketch.png

I had many revisions and sometimes it's just overcomplicating things. The plastic-on-wood altitude bearing worked extremely well for the smaller telescopes, so I did not even ad gliders or anything. For a 8" it would not work.

The 8" dobsonian should give better views if collimated. If it's a shorter one (F/5 aperture ratio for example) cheap eyepieces will only be sharp in the center, while the 114mm has F/8 which will produce sharp images throughout the field in cheaper eyepieces. 

Odd. Or perhaps the shorter eyepieces where just too much magnification?

A shorter focal length will give a larger field of view with the same eyepiece.

The F-stop / Aperture-ratio does not play as big of a role as with imaging, as the eyepiece determines the amount of light that reaches our eye.Hello :-)

The 1.25" focuser diameter limits the maximum field of view. A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl will show about the maximum possible (a 40mm just has a smaller apparent field of view)

A 2" overview eyepiece can show a larger field:

 -  [Collage at a similar focal length as a 8"](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg)

So under ~25mm you don't need 2" eyepieces unless it's ultra wide angle ones such as the 9mm 100\u00b0.

There are also short 2" eyepieces that are just more expensive and don't have any benefit but that they save you the adapter swapping.

.

The Meade 4000 are Super Pl\u00f6ssl. Under 10mm the eye relief of that type gets very short, and the 52\u00b0 apparent field of view will make the tracking a bit difficult as the planet will move out of the view at 200x (6mm used with a 1200mm foal length telescope) relatively quickly. 

More modern eyepieces than the Pl\u00f6ssl have a larger eye lens even at 1.25", and a longer eye relief even at very short focal lengths.

.


For a 8" dobsonian consider

- A 2" 30-36mm wide-angle (70-80\u00b0) eyepiece

- A 6mm for 200x (more is possible but atmospheric seeing conditions often limit magnification)

- One or two in-between, especially in the 2-3mm exit pupil range that's ideal for many deep-sky observations. At F/6 that is a 12-18mm eyepiece.


Depending on your budget, the wide-angle costs $70-$350 (Explore Scientific 30mm70\u00b0, University Optics 30mm80\u00b0, q70 32mm, SWAN 33mm, Explore Scientific 30mm 82\u00b0)

The 1.25" wide angle cost $24-150 (Chinese "Gold line" or from [Corvus optics](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/), Explore Scientific 82\u00b0 1.25"...).

.

The 2" eyepieces are rather expensive. Instead of getting the XT8 consider the Zhumell [z8](http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope). It already includes a much better 2" eyepiece than the xt8 or even xt8 plus, a dual speed focuser, a big right-angle finder scope, a moon filter, laser collimator...

Even the [Sky-Watcher 8"](http://www.telescopes.com/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-7) is worth considering over the xt8 as it has a better finder-scope, but it too lacks of the 2" wide angle eyepiece.Consider the Zhumell z8 as it has better accessories, a 2" wide angle eyepiece woth $70 alone.

Difference larger aperture makes: https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622Hello :-)

First rule: Don't judge in-store reviews :-) Also often reviews are made by beginners who just don't know better. You'll find some ridiculous telescope starter kits at Amazon with high ratings. Also: 2.5 star average rating is not overwhelming.

Second rule: If possible buy at an Astronomy store. They have a wider selection, better product specific support, and better listings. For example Costco specified the magnification wrong :-) Also short reflector telescopes should have a mirror specified as parabolic, which this one does not mention. I can't find it at Celestron's website.

Third rule: All telescope kits come with basic accessories, few exceptions. Especially in this price range the eyepieces are often of poor quality.  You will need to pay at least ~cad$30-50 ea. for one or more eyepieces; Especially for these short telescopes.


Celestron has other 130mm telescopes that are OK, but  the thing that puzzles me is why the mirror is not specified as parabolic, while other Celestron 130mm telescopes are.


The mounts are usually the weak point of starter sets, but this one is better than comparable offers. Usually I would recommend the "Heritage 130p" from Sky-Watcher.


The eyepiece / accessories of this set are very basic. For planets you will need a higher magnification eyepiece which can cost $50cad or so, or a cad$30 "Barlow" that doubles/triples magnification is another option (but lowers the contrast and it's not ideal with the cheap kit eyepiece!).


.

Anyway, enough about the 130az. Normally I would recommend the Heritage 130p or better [xt8](http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html) (which will [show more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) and lasts a life-time; Call for availability before ordering there) but it's over budget and you insist on buying at Costco. 

IMHO the sticky has a few outdated suggestions and there are other brands &amp; prices in Canada.

Don't forget something like "Turn left at Orion" and a dim red light, it's crucial to use a telescope. Compared to an App it  preserves night vision better and does not only show you where to find objects, but how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, and what to expect. Also, binoculars. E.g. Cometron 7x50 $40, not high-end, but decent budget. Their wide field of view makes orientation easier and go together well worth a first telescope.

Sorry for the lengthy reply; TL;DR: The 130az is probably one of the better sets they have in the price range, but I would suggest something else (Heritage 130p, 6-8" dobsonian, or at least Celestron/Meade 130eq as they specify the mirror).

Where are you from? I could check for used offers. &gt; Calgary AB

- 4.5" reflector on a simple yet sturdy box: The small dobsonian (similar to Orions xt4.5). Will outperform the slightly larger 130/650 regarding planets due to the relaxed aperture ratio.

- 130/900 on EQ2: Already not great regarding stability; You can sometimes get 114/900 or 130/900 for &lt;$60 (not the short tubes with 1000mm focal length though) and build your own rockerbox though. Some can tolerate such larges telescopes on EQ2, I would not recommend it.

- ioptron Goto Twinstar: Computerized -&gt; does not neccessarily make things easier! Also this seems to be the 6" bird-jones newtonian telescope, which has flaws/issues compared to regular reflectors. The tracking functionality could be used for wide-field astro photography (just camera+lens without telescope, &lt;30s exposures, similar to [this](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY); Snapshot of planets, but the bird-jones design lowers the contrast a bit)

Otherwise a lot of smaller or overpriced telescopes on there. Just a quick look. The white 4.5" dobsonian is a steal. The missing finder scope is a issue but can easily be replaced (either a new cad$30, or buy the other used $15 telescope on Kijiji and strip the finder). The only telescope that would perform better is a 6 or 8" dobsonian (As mentioned; new from cad$371).That's quite a long fox you got there.Hello,

I just started stargazing a few years ago, it's an interesting hobby. I volunteered at a local school and did some astronomy related things too - besides that, I'm just an amateur ;-)Hello,

Check if you can find a used one. What area are you from?

Or sell the telescope and get the Heritage 130p ($324) but of course that's a different telescope, without an eq mount.

OR save a bit to get a 6" dobsonian, $459.95
Hello,

congratulations on your first light :-)

While light pollution is an issue, the 10mm should still show some objects well (e.g. double stars and such). Though many objects suffer from the LP. Best focus on clusters, doubles and the brighter nebulae. The AWB Onesky is a great wide-field instrument and sort of fills the gap between binoculars and telescopes.

Did you build a light shroud? It helps a lot in places where there's direct light nearby.

The moon also influences deep-sky observations. But planets don't suffer from it, so you'll be able to see Jupiter just fine. Keep in mind with the 10mm eyepiece at 65x it will be rather small but you may be able to detect the cloud bands anyway (and of course it's moons will be visible even in the 25mm).

You also discovered the most important accessory for star-gazing: Warm shoes &amp; socks :-)

Possible targets;

 - http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/winter.html

 - Buy Turn left at Orion or download the PDF (but the paper version has many benefits).
 
Cool-down: The "little" telescope cools down quick, and at 65x that should not be an issue.  Andromeda can be underwhelming from within light polluted areas. I really enjoyed M51 and also M81/M82 as well as the ring nebula from just outside my city, but half a mile makes a lot of difference here (faint vs hard to miss).

Wild-life: All the noises at night can give one the creeps :-) But as a rule of thumb: The animals don't want to get bothered either. Just stay away from obvious dangers (and wild boars protecting their young).

Clear skies!Hello! :-)

You can go multiple ways; There are also modules for Arduino such as [this](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-New-Ardublock-graphical-programming-learning-kit-Zero-based-learning-for-Arduino/2044893753.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.631Hov&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1) or [that](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-Helpful-37-in-1-For-Starters-Compatible-Sensor-Module-Kit-Vibration-switch-Flame/32422836798.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_80%2Csearchweb201644_0%2Csearchweb201560_1&amp;spm=2114.031010208.3.1.rFgGfk); But for complex projects that's not ideal and connections / sensor readings can be wonky.

I'm doing this as project at a local school (and we program in Ardublock, which is somewhat similar to Mindstorms, but not as polished).


As you already have some experience with Mindstorms and Arduino, it should not be too difficult to go with a kit and a tutorial (For example: [1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH
) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) [5](http://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-free-book-for-beginners/)) or book. Of course the Kits from Arduino, Sparkfun or Adafruit are all-in-one solution, but it's not overly hard to go with one of the tutorials as the Chinese kit contains the most common components. 

While the kits come with almost everything you need, consider a few spare $2.80 Arduino Uno compatibles (typically require different drivers but work well), $1-$2 breadboards and [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874); For example a 2wd robot chassis for $10, a H-Bridge motor driver and ultrasonic sensor for under a dollar each. Also a selection of Resistors and other common parts.

Also consider a multimeter (even a $4 will do for low current/low voltage tasks), a soldering iron (a adjustable soldering station for $20+ would be best). A decent soldering iron makes it much easier; I started with a cheap one and used to hate soldering :-) There are modules you just hook up with dupont cables, but the connections aren't always reliable. $1 soldering irons work for a few connections but it can be frustrating.

Depending on previous experience you could grab a copy of "Getting started in electronics" (fun to read, easy and still gives you a impression of the "inner workings" of electronics). Or practical electronics for inventors. Written well, not too complicated, but also includes a lot of important math and formulas. While the Arduino tutorials will cover some basics (resistors, current) it helps to understand a bit more about what's going on.

Have fun with Arduino! :-)Hello :-)

What country are you from? The available telescopes vary from country to country. In Europe, GSO and Skywatcher are more common than, say, Orion.

What telescopes did you have in the past? What finder, what guide?

.

**Finding VS searching**

The main problem with the smaller telescope starter sets are the narrow field of view of eyepieces and finder. For big telescope, there are 2" wide angle eyepieces for a [better overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) and there's also the [Telrad/Rigel](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) finders.

Also, in addition, every smartphone (even the \u20ac40 last generation ones) have motion sensors; There are several free Apps that will show you where to point the telescope to, if you really struggle with map &amp; finder. 

Keep in mind GoTo can have it's own quirks (Setup, battery supply, failing alignment); You will have to know a few basics, and than finding things yourself is not hard. A book such as "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo manual of most telescopes. There are many forum posts for the SLT mounts for example where people struggle with alignment accuracy &amp; back-slash. While the auto-alignment is terrific, it's not perfect.

I have a GoTo mount and a larger telescope.  I use the manual telescope a lot more. I use a 2" wide-angle eyepiece and a Telrad to find things, and it's basically point+look with the right maps.


.

**GoTo telescopes**

Of course there are neat GoTo telescopes, but most money goes into the electronics instead of the optics. For your budget you could get a Celestron Nexstar 127 SLT (starts at ~\u20ac500 over here) or Orion Starseeker 6" (not sure about that combination's  mount stability...). Sadly there's a larger gap to the 6se or 8se.

Keep in mind you can get a LARGER manual telescope for LESS. And still have enough to spare for a GOOD finder and WIDE-ANGLE eyepiece :-)

While a 5" will show the planets nicely and already shows a bit of detail regarding deep-sky, a 8" dobsonian for 375\u20ac can show the spiral structures of some galaxies under dark skies, while they remain faint fuzzies in 5".

 - [**What to expect** in different apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)

.

**Wide-field**

Also, many of the GoTo telescopes in that price range are either wide-field reflectors (130slt, 130p synscan...) and the 5" or 6" Maksutovs have a relatively narrow field of view due to their long focal length. Larger GoTo setups often come in form of the Maksutovs as their short length is easier to mount steady. You can buy 2" adapters and eyepieces for some, but that can add to the cost.

.

**Imaging**

Imaging with the Alt-Az Goto mounts is limited to short exposures and the long focal length and slow aperture ratio of some of these make imaging not easy either. It seems much simpler in theory than it really is. Have you done imaging before? On a fixed tripod? Or perhaps a barn-door?

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce


.

A smaller equatorial GoTo mount (NEQ3, EQ5) costs as much as your whole budget without a telescope and they are limited to 5"/6" telescopes or so (especially for imaging use!).


.

What do you want to observe? What do you want to image and what quality are you expecting?Well, for planets, you an just use an App as they are easy to point at... as you already have tracking.


Without knowing your set-up I'm not sure. Skwatcher sells their Goto rockerboxes separately I think.If you had one of those beginner telescopes you'd be surprised how easy finding things with a decent finder is. Really, I've been there, consider the manual approach.

The small department store / kids telescope finders where tiny, blurry, had a narrow field of view and some where impossible to align. I didn't find anything but the moon and Saturn with my first telescope. Modern finders, especially right-angle correct-image finders, are comfortable to use and almost spotting-scope quality. Larger field of view, better optics.


With a [Telrad you just need to align circles to the sky as shown on maps](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif) which is even easier.

Same with eyepieces. Cheap old kit eyepieces where as seen on the left (30-40\u00b0), while even the cheaper modern ones have 60-70\u00b0.

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AFOV.png

 There's surely a astronomy club/society/meet-up around where you can probably try different finding techniques.

I basically have the 130slt. I rarely use it. I rather use the manual 5" dobsonian or the larger 10". It's easier, and regarding the 10", shows more. 

When I got lost in the past, I just let Night Sky Tools tell me where to push my telescope to. No need to wait for tiny motors to purr for a minute :-)

For planets, consider the 127 SLT. The 130slt is more a wide-field. It'll show planets, but not nearly as nice. A 6" or 8" dobsonian will beat both by far. Even though 200-250x magnification is all you can use due to atmospheric seeing conditions, the larger aperture has a higher resolution and brighter image at the same magnification.

Even the small toy telescope can show the rings of Saturn, the largest moons of Jupiter are even visible in binoculars. They will remain more or less dots without details, even in bigger telescopes.
Only Jupiter, Saturn and Mars (if conditions are good)
show noteworthy surface-details. And they aren't up all the time. So a larger aperture for deep-sky observations is always worth considering.You can get decent budget eyepieces relatively cheap. Kit eyepieces are usually not too great, and you really need one or two to get the most out of your telescope.optical Flow sensor?

 Hi :-)

The GSO Deluxe are what's closest to the Zhumell. 

The mirrors are usually of same quality in this price range.

I suppose import taxes might be different than in the US; Typically telescopes cost the same in \u20ac as they cost in $, sometimes even more.

Keep in mind stars will remain stars ;-)

As mentioned, for portability, there's the  Explore-scientific 12" ultra-light (but the open truss will be vulnerable to stray light).

Did you check for used dobsonians by the way?

Clear skies :-)This. Avoid zoom. &lt;10x is easier to hold free-handed, &gt;10x will require  a tripod.

Personally I enjoy 8x or so.

What's the budget? How dark is your observing location (can you see the milky way) and what do you want to observe?
As [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew) I just used a large [black cardboard](http://ringohr.de/tmp6/DSC_0739.jpg) sheet; The advantages; Cheap, easy to cut, slides into the tube. After getting wet it might needs to be replaced, but mine holds up for a long time now, even with dew.

Some others used black foam.Hello :-)

taking images with a phone through the eyepiece is difficult &amp; tedious. There are holders/clamps available, though. Phones have limited camera settings.

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3ekwgd/the_moon_last_night_from_my_8_inch_telescope/ctfxcjn


**Barl*no* and maximum magnification eyepieces**

Anyway, skip the barlow. Get a dedicated eyepiece. It will show a larger apparent field of view and overall performs better than barlow+cheap kit eyepiece.

The maximum magnification for this telescope is limited, despite what the advertising may suggest. I would not push it beyond 200x, as the "short" mirror has to be perfectly parabolic and the obstruction limits the contrast further.

3.2mm or 4mm HR Planetary would give you more magnification; More will just make the image dark and dull, you will feel the urge to use more, but you won't actually gain anything.

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

 - http://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-25-3-2mm-58-Degree-TMB-Planetary-Eyepiece/32340927306.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.9.cJzIxu&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1

The HR Planetary are nice, have a tad more apparent field of view.

The ["gold line"](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/) have a even larger apparent field of view.  The moon fit's nicely into the 6mm66\u00b0 eyepiece at 108x magnification. The image isn't as dark as in the 3-4mm eyepiece.

.

**Deep-sky eyepiece**

The 15mm would be beneficial for many deep-sky observations as the exit pupil (light beam diameter exiting the eyepiece) will still provide a relatively bright image while the contrast to the background is better (especially under light polluted skies) and the slightly higher magnification than the overview eyepiece will be ideal for many nebulae.

.

**Overview**

The 25mm  kit eyepiece isn't bad. A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl will show you a slightly field of view.

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fieldcompare.jpg

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/plossl/

If the telescope has a 2" focuser, you can also get a 2" wide angle eyepiece that will show yet a bit more. They start at $70-$100 though, and with a telescope with an aperture ratio of  F/5, they will not be sharp across the outer field of view.

The cheaper ones are the Explore-Scientific 70\u00b0 or GSO30mm $69, the q70 32mm, SWAN 33mm... The Baader Aspheric ... or even better right away the Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 ultra wide angle will perform much better at F/5 than the others, but cost almost as much as a 8" telescope  :-)

.

**Finderscope:**

 There should be two or three screws to adjust. Align during the day at a very remote object (mountain, tower...). Avoid looking into the sun at any cost!

.

Do you have a **collimation tool**? $0-$20. 

 - http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165


.

**What to observe**

Consider buying "Turn left at Orion" and a dim right lamp - It will not only show you where to find objects and preservers night vision better than a back-lit display, but also how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, and what to expect. Even with a GoTo mount it's worth considering. Also Stellarium (Freeware, PC/Mac) and Night Sky Tools (App). 

As for on-line resources, e.g.

 - http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/winter.html

.

**What to avoid**

Zoom eyepieces have a narrow field of view on one side of the setting. Eyepiece kits are overpriced, mediocre, redundant. A moon filter can be nice but with a 6mm eyepiece or under the image will get dark enough so it won't bother most people in a 5"F/5.

.

.

A 5" telescope is a nice entry to the hobby. Compact, yet it shows quite a bit already. The SLT mount isn't perfect, but if aligned right it's a very nice gadget! Don't hop from object to object though. Let your eyes ajdust. Spotting structure in the spiral Galaxy M51 took over half an hour for me, mostly in mid-range magnification.

.


Clear skies, have fun!Neat!

$20 is really cheap for a DIY one :-) Any details on how you made it and what materials you used?

Keep in mind 50\u20ac will only get you a basic pair of binoculars. For astronomy some people spend insane amounts of money :-) 

I have cheaper ones as well and I'm quite happy, but in the future  I want a nice pair (6x30 -8x60 in the 200\u20ac+ range). The astronomy bug is really something expensive to treat.

Sadly the Celestron 7x50 are more expensive over here in Europe, they cost $35 in the US and are pretty neat for what they are. //Edit: ([Review](http://www.space.com/27866-celestron-cometron-7x50-binoculars-review.html)); Teleskop-Express has them for \u20ac45 which isn't too bad. But they have a large exit pupil, more ideal for dark observing locations. Remember more power isn't better.

So what do you want to observe, how dark is your observing location?

Do you have a telescope by the way? :-)Hello :-) Glad it was helpful. 

Any idea what you are planning on getting?

Great book; When I was a bit younger I started with "Getting started in electronics"; Practical inventors is a bit more complex, but that can be a good thing.Hi, slightly off-topic: Any advice on what version to use or is there an easy way to remove blocks/categories? Students try to use other blocks all the time (the latest beta has all sorts of robot presets, sadly some of those don't even have public libraries).With the &lt;$25 kit you can't do anything wrong. You'll have enough for tutorials and beyond that for own projects :-)

 Aliexpress is basically like eBay, a lot of sellers. They ship international from China so it takes 2-4 weeks or so. The components in the kit come without a tutorial, but the components are standard sensors used in almost every tutorial out there. //edit: But check out tax/duty regulations [here](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:A_pAb8v-sPgJ:www.dutycalculator.com/country-guides/Import-duty-taxes-when-importing-into-Jordan/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de) or better at the official local site.

I live in Germany and order there a lot as it's so much cheaper there. If I would buy here I could build one robot with students... With Aliexpress I was able to buy one for every student :-)

The obstacle avoiding robot costs $15 and is a fun project. You can get it up and running with 10 lines of code or 6 Ardublock-Elements (if distance &lt; 60cm stop one motor for a second). From there on it's fun to expand, making it smarter, adding sensors, servos and so on.

What's your budget? Are you planning to build something specific?

Have a nice day :-)If you use the 3.2mm the image will already be noticeably dimmer in the 5", you won't need a moon filter with that eyepiece. 


I mostly use a 32mm52\u00b0 or 20mm70\u00b0 for overview (depending on light pollution), a 12mm70\u00b0 (as I had it before discovering the "gold line"), a 8mm58\u00b0 HR Planetary (not as often anymore), a 6mm66\u00b0 gold line, and the 3.2mm58\u00b0; I have the 2.5mm but rarely use it as the image will get dark and it doesn't gain anything really.

IMHO the 32mm or kit eyepiece + 15mm + 3.2mm can go a long way. 6mm wouldn't hurt either, but you have the 9mm and upgrading bit by bit is more ideal than buying a whole bunch and never using half of them :-)
There are some apps with a few more settings, but usually try at infinity-focus-setting and focus with the telescope.

Qapla'! :-)That's a big budget! :-) I agree, don't blow it all at once. With one of the cheaper kits you can get started and once you know what else you'll need you can still buy more. The advantage of the single components is that you can build all sort of circuits and aren't dependent on solely modules.

You could get a 3D printer :-) I recently bought two in the $200 price range, it's an amazing technology and you can make all sort of parts. You could even make parts for friends or school ;-)

There are a couple of desk-sized ones [[[1]](http://www.tinyboy.net/), [[2]](http://www.emakershop.com/emaker-huxleys-first-demo), [[3]](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20131022-qu-bd-one-up-open-source-3d-printer-kit-on-kickstarter.html) ]; Sadly Hobbyking does not have the TinyBoy in stock anymore. It's a small cube. Noise is tolerable (depending on the speed) and with PLA there's no bad smell either. It was just an idea :-)

It's too bad they won't let younger students use it, but I suppose it has reasons. I even let the 5th graders make and print things.

Sorry for getting so far off-topic :-)Yes, you can! You can even swap the  color mid-print. :-)

Of course the pause might be visible as small irregularity where it resumes.

Smaller parts don't even need that long depending on the settings. 

I just recevied a bigger one (was on sale a while ago), a Prusa i3 ([1](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Full-Acylic-Upgraded-Prusa-i3-3d-Printer-DIY-kit-P802-High-Precision-Reprap-Bowden-extruder-single/32340184418.html), [2](http://reprap.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=File:Prusa-i3-wood.jpg&amp;limit=50)); The Chinese kits are not perfect but it's amazing, not up and running yet, but seems good so far.

I don't know if there's a teacher who could assist you with building a kit, but there are also more simple kits or pre-built printers (printrbot, oneup, ...). But you learn a lot when assembling these, which is incredible helpful if something malfunctions.  Sorry, I did not check for the shipping to your country; I will check later when I am at home. Some offer "free" international shipping.Hello,


The z12 costs less and has a 2" wide angle eyepiece worth $70 alone, dual speed focuser, right angle finder, **moon filter**.

Collapsible can be nice if you have small storage/car space, otherwise full tube is better. Also the flex tube are not really lighter, some of theme are even heavier than full tubes.

Don't get the Barlow, get a dedicated eyepiece :-) E.g. a long eye relief 6mm [[a](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/), [b](http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/)].

And a 15mm while you're at it, and you're set for a long time. Of course there are better eyepieces, but those will give you a good start.

Eyepiece kits: Don't.  Mediocre, overpriced. The Pl\u00f6ssl cost $17-23 and the Barlow $22 or so at Corvus optics. Again, get some wide angle, long eye relief eyepieces. They make finding, observing and tracking easier.I checked, some printers have $80-$120 shipping, seems to be quite a bit more expensive to ship to Jordan; Not too steep but still unpleasant.Very nice :-) I'm planning to make wearables with students but still not sure what materials to use and where to source cheap.Hello :-)

For a 10" consider a 2" wide angle eyepiece for a better overview, e.g. ~30mm depending on how dark your sky gets; $70-100 for simple ones (Explore Scientific 70\u00b0, GSO, SWAN...), better the 2" Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 that cost triple but work better at F/5.

For planets, something around 200-250x magnification can be nice. More isn't always possible due to atmospheric seeing conditions. Budget wide-angle &amp; decent eye relief are the $24-$50 Gold line or hr planetary, e.g. 

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

TeleVue are nice, but even a TeleVue Pl\u00f6ssl &lt;10mm will have a painfully short eye relief.

Also something with 2-3mm exit pupil, -&gt; = 10-15mm.


Without knowing how much you are willing to spend and what eyepieces you still need it's difficult to make better suggestions :-)Wasn't one included?

Perhaps your primary collimation screws are all the way in or out?

Did you try focusing during the day on a near object or at night already?I bought the Tiny Boy / Mini Fabrikator when Hobbyking had a free shipping sale, got it for ~$160 and payed around $30 tax/duty/customs. Neat little printer, worked almost perfectly out of the box. I was sceptical, but despite the small print volume, it's a neat ready-to-run printer.

I already have a PP3DP UP+1 and a Printrbot LC which I use for workshops at a local school, but two printers can be a bottle neck when working with many students. When Aliexpress had their 11.11 sale I also bought a  ~$200 (incl. shipping) Prusa i3 kit. The latter is not ready yet but so far it looks fine. Not too happy about all-acrylic, but for $200 I won't complain.

edit:Name mixed upThe 6mm "gold line" has a larger apparent field of view, but some report they have problems with "[kidney beaning](http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/ae3.html#collimation)" when not looking through it straight. When I rest my eye against the rubber eye cup I don't notice any kidney beaning.  The gold lines are also sold as "blue line", Orion Expanse ~$70. Great eyepieces. Barely more expensive than  a Pl\u00f6ssl, and the 6-15mm work well enough at F/5.


The HR Planetary have good eye relief, good sharpness/contrast, and are still very affordable. Even at F/5 they are still decent, at least the shorter ones. They are available in many focal lengths while there are only four gold lines. Their apparent field of view is a bit smaller than the 66\u00b0 gold line. But still larger than the 52\u00b0 Pl\u00f6ssl or 40\u00b0-50\u00b0 kit eyepieces.

If you have more money to spend, the Explore Scientific 82\u00b0 are great. $150-$350 depending on size/focal length. You can get them used sometimes for $100-$250 or so.

Of course there are many eyepieces in between, e.g. the 82\u00b0 Luminos or Lacerta, and the Baader Hyperion / Aspheric.

Do not underestimate the value of a good 2" wide-angle eyepiece. I observed with a 1.25" overview eyepiece a long time with my 10", a 30mm70\u00b0 made a huge difference. :-)Try at a further away object (or at night), see if the focuser travel is enough.

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/teles2.html

The closer the object, the further out the eyepiece has to be to reach focusThe ones I looked at where all in the $200 range, so basically $250-$300 with shipping.

Perhaps your mom's friends would be a solution for that though ;-) Not sure about import regulations &amp; cost though, but at least it would save the shipping.

I hope I didn't talk you into anything, but a 3D Printer is a fun device, some also with Arduino based electronics, and there's a lot to modify, optimize and tinker. And of course the whole print your own robot part things.I always get it mixed up too ;-) Hope it'll be enough.

http://agenaastro.com/parts-accessories/adapters/extension-tubes.html

http://www.telescope.com/Astrophotography/Astrophotography-Accessories/2-Orion-Telescope-Eyepiece-Extension-Tube/c/4/sc/61/p/5124.utsSounds like a plan! :-) They might even get cheaper, or better, or both. Not too long ago it was unthinkable you could get a 3D printer for $200.

Hey, you can also build a simple drawing plotter with the $2 Arduino compatibles and $1.20 servos or $1.50 stepper motors :-)

http://letsmakerobots.com/node/31381?page=1Hello :-) Difficult to answer. Some can learn things like that at 8, some don't. I have written my first simple programs in Basic witt 7 or 8. Some students I have in workshops don't even grasp programming well at 15.

I am currently building [these](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Tracing-car-box-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Send-the-Battery-Box-For/32291913537.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.117.xk4EqF&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_5,searchweb201560_1) with students. Assembly is rather straight forward.

Getting it to do something on it's own is another thing. It's not hard. But someone would have to probably do it with him.

You can get everything for around $[15](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3umf0c/beginner_project_that_doesnt_require_soldering/cxg438k).

"Ardublock" is a bit like Lego Mindstorms, but less polished. A basic obstacle avoiding solution can be done in 6 blocks or so (if distance &lt;60 stop one motor for a second).

With a bunch of example codes that could work of course. But problems start at installing drivers or choosing the right Com port to program the Arduino.

There's even an Ardublock [set](http://aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-New-Ardublock-graphical-programming-learning-kit-Zero-based-learning-for-Arduino/2044893753.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1) (used to sell for $15). I use these at Workshops. An easier introduction without soldering for simpler projects.

.

There's also a Arduino book for kids:  *Arduino Adventures - Escape from Gemini Station* - It's a bit cheesy and sometimes the projects seem a bit forced, but he might enjoy it.

.

There *was* the Fritzing creator kit that targeted kids, and the tutorial was easy to understand. Why it's sold out (discountinued?) beats me...

Perhaps get him a copy of "Getting started in Electronics" which is simple and fun, yet teaches a lot. And of course the necessary parts to build some stuff.

Yes, in 10mm it doesn't really make sense :-)

Thanks to the short focal length of the AWB/Heritage Andromeda fits into the view of the overview eyepiece; http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fieldcompare.jpg ...but for the 10mm the smaller galaxies are better targets :-) if it's really just a tad you could see if you can get the primary up a bit via collimation screws, but that's not elegant :-)Hello :-)

The Heritage 130p (AWB Onesky in the US) is indeed a nice starter telescope. It's [not perfect, but there are a lot of little tweaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew).

Normally I would suggest you take a look at the [6" dobsonian](http://www.firstlightoptics.com/beginner-telescopes/skywatcher-skyliner-150p-dobsonian.html) and buy from a telescope dealer instead of Amazon, but it's a bit over budget and the whole table-top-indoor-use brings up several issues.

When you observe through a closed window, the glass will cause distortion. Window glass is not made for optical grade observing at high magnifications :-) Also newer windows are made of plastic. And windows consist of  multiple layers, making things worse. Reflections, contrast, distortions.

When observing through an open window, the difference in temperature - even when the radiator is off - will cause air currents &amp; turbulences that will cause seeing effects, so you can not observe at higher magnifications; The object will not quite get in focus and wobble.

A window only offers a very narrow field of view. You might not even see any planets from your window. Depending on view and direction.

Yes, you will be able to see something through the window. I do observe the planets through ours sometimes, but it's more fun from the balcony as I can use higher magnifications and see more details. Deep-sky through the window is almost impossible.

So don't bother if you don't at least once in a while go outside.

Get at least out on the balcony, the back-yard, or door-step. 



The difference Aperture makes:

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

 - The longer 6" has a more relaxed aperture ratio. The mirror quality of the 130p is not perfect. For planets, the 6" will perform a LOT better, also for deep-sky. The 130p is very portable though, I use it more frequently than my larger dobsonian. Scrap the barlow. Get dedicated eyepieces first.

Consider the Explore Scientific, they are nearly as good for a fragment of the cost.

 - Explore Scientific [30mm](http://www.optcorp.com/eyepieces/all-eyepieces-not-sets-kits/explore-scientific-30mm-82-degree-waterproof-eyepiece.html) 82\u00b0 overview

 - 10-15mm for deep-sky

 - 5-6mm for planets ([1](http://www.optcorp.com/explore-scientific-6-7mm-82-degree-waterproof-eyepiece.html) [2](http://www.optcorp.com/explore-scientific-4-7mm-82-degree-waterproof-eyepiece.html) [3](http://www.optcorp.com/explore-scientific-5-5mm-100-degree-eyepiece.html))

 - They too have 120\u00b0 eyepieces.

 - fill gaps later. Three good ones can go a long way. Plus you have your 9mm and 25mm.  IMHO you won't need a coma corrector right away at F/4.7. Some tolerate it, some don't.


More than 200-250x magnification is rarely possible due to atmospheric seeing conditions limiting the maximum most of the time. Also only three planets show noteworthy surface details, you may use a mid-range eyepiece for deep-sky more often. It's not about magnification, but about contrast and how much light reaches your eye. More magnification makes things dimmer.

On a good day, for planets, a 10" can magnify up to 500x - something you'll rarely reach. There's also the [Astro-Zoom](http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=astrozoom&amp;min=0&amp;max=0) with Lacerta eyepieces. Opposite to the many wide-range zooms the Astro-Zoom's apparent field of view does not get smaller when zooming.

Barlows sound great, but you'll have several issues. A good one costs as much as a decent eyepiece. Swapping at night can be tedious. They will introduce some chromatic aberration. They are open and dirt on the lens will be visible when viewing.



What other things do you have?

 - A good book/map is crucial. E.g. "Turn left at Orion" and a dim red light will preserve night-vision better than a back-lit display, and the book not only shows you where to find objects, but how to observe, what's worthwhile, what to expect.

 - A good finder scope; The basic XT come with a red dot finder, what does yours have? Consider a 8x50 right angle correct image (RACI) finder and/or a [Telrad/Rigel](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) under dark skies.
 
 -  an adjustable chair is just as important. E.g. a cheap adjustable height ironing chair will make viewing more comfortable.

 - Luxury: Tracking; EQ-Platform [1](http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/info/p5419_Dobson-EQ-Plattform-fuer-Dobson-Teleskope-bis-60kg---45--bis-55--Breite.html) [2](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/EQ-Plattform-bis-16-oder-60-kg-Tragkraft-/251195106745?hash=item3a7c6525b9:m:mpFCURZtP3Gnkp2jg1XTndg) [3](http://www.reinervogel.net/Plattform/Plattform_e.html)

 - Filters: Moon filter, planetary contrast filers, good UHC/OIII... filters for certain nebulae type. Optional but helpful. Depending on your observing targets.Don't trust pictures/videos, visual astronomy is different due to the way our eyes work ;-) [Those links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) are better describing what to expect.

For planets, the 6" would be worth the upgrade IMHO. The longer focal length / F/8 aperture ratio has several benefits (smaller obstruction, less mirror quality issues, as good as no visible coma distortion, easier to reach higher magnification, brighter image, higher resolution). The amount of light gathered increases by the surface area.

Also check if you can get a used 8" dobsonian. But be aware of the size;

Yes it can be overwhelming, and it's easy to spend as much on accessories as on the  telescope itself, but even with some basic accessories you can see a lot.

Edit: Dedicated eyepiece over barlow as the kit eyepieces aren't too great and the barlow doesn't make things better. Moon filter optional, depends on telescope, magnification and preference.Personally I think 82\u00b0 is great and they have a wider selection of focal lengths.

They don't have 2" for all eyepieces, only the ultra wide angle. Under ~20mm you can make 82\u00b0 wide angle eyepieces as 1.25". Congratulations :-)

Consider getting Turn left at Orion.

What eyepieces do you have? For the short telescope you might need some additional for the planets.At 400mm focal length the 10mm will give you 40x magnification, barely enough to recognize Saturn and Jupiter as what they are;

The kit eyepieces are OK for wide-field :-) The Skyscanner is a nice wide-field telescope and will show quite a few nebulae &amp; galaxies.

I'm not sure how far this telescope should be pushed magnification wise, 4mm eyepiece -&gt; 100x, 3.2mm -&gt; 125x, 2.5mm -&gt; 160x - I would not go higher than ~150-160x despite specs stating 200x. It will just be dimer and slightly enlarged.

http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-25-3-2mm-58-Degree-TMB-Planetary-Eyepiece/32340927306.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.9.FXmgkS&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_4_79_78_77_80,searchweb201644_0,searchweb201560_1

There are a few budget solutions such as a 3x or 5x Barlow for $20, but combined with the kit eyepiece that's not ideal. There's also a 4mm for $8 from China, but it's not all that good, more a temporary solution :-)Then that's the tube diameter, not the mirror diameter. 

The tube has to be a bit larger than the mirror diameter.

Most likely 6".

Then again, my 5" has 6" inner tube diameter and 7" outer diameter. 

Especially if it is a custom build.

Ask for a image of the label, there's usually one on the side or back; 

 - like this http://fotos.bilder-speicher.de/083/tu-ruz-uzt-u-uz-13092722897944.jpg

 IF you do buy it and have to clean it, don't wash/clean it like you would clean a regular household mirror.This. Probably the 6", but who knows for sure.Did you check out Stellarium? You can even switch to a different lore.

About Kwtelescopes, from the recent reports here on the forum, it's better to call before ordering. Their 8" is incredibly cheap. (http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html)

Collimation

 - +1 on the Cheshire. Only rather pricey lasers are worth it. 

 - http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165

 

Filters

 - Baader solar filters are great and one of the few choices worth considering. Sun in visual light looks different though than the images you'll see taken with special equipment;

 - UHC/OIII or other nebula filters: Great for specific nebulae types.

 - Skyglow/Light-pollution filters: No miracles are to be expected, a darker location works better :-)

 - Moon filter: Either view the moon at very high magnifications or get a adjustable polarisation filter.


Also...

 - Adjustable height ironing chair! :-)

 - Turn left at Orion  --- the missing manual

 - Warm socks.The RaspberryPi has enough processing power to process video or stream it. 

The Wifi-camera would be an easy solution to use with the Arduino, as the Arduino does not have enough ressources to process or even just stream the video.Hello,

congratulations on your "first light" :-)

Yes, it's incredible what you can see even with smaller optics.

Too bad your chair broke!

What light do you use for reading in the dark? Adjustable red light?

Of course a telescope is nice, but a lot of objects actually look nicer in binoculars as they show a wider field of view :-) And it's easier to start with 5 or 10\u00b0 field of view than with a telescope.



Clear skies!Hello :-)

First of all: Why two?

The 114az is not ideal, nice for some wide-field, but the F/4 aperture ratio has a few flaws.

The 4se is nice, but you can also get the $420 Nexstar 127slt which has a slightly different mount but more aperture.

For the same money you can get a 8" dobsonian and much better accessories/eyepieces that'll show so much more...

 - Difference aperture makes https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

There are good and bad telescopes from every brand. What did you own before?


GoTo telescopes are nice, but most money goes into the electronics, not the optics. The simple GoTo mounts in this price range are not suited well for imaging. Also you are very dependent on batteries/power, as some of these mounts should not be moved manually. Even with GoTo you will have to know a few basics. Something like "turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo computer handset's manual, and after reading it (AND with a decent finder scope) finding things manually is a piece of cake. If you run into troubles, there are free Apps that even run on an old $40 smart phone that can literally show you which way to push your telescope to locate things. Even $30 wide-angle eyepieces will somewhat compensate for the tracking functionality at moderate magnifications.Well, it works when there's a full moon :-)

I did the bike-light mod, it's a decent budget solution. Or solder in a variable resistor ;-)

Good luck for your next observations! :-) What guide/book do you have, if any?What do you mean, are you planning on getting them used? What's your budget? Do you want to observe or take images?

If you had a small department store telescope the mount and finder telescope where probably garbage. A decent finder scope is basically a good little spotting scope that will make finding easy.

You don't need push-to if you have a smartphone IMHO. More or less the same thing, just much more expensive.

Good maps, a dim red light, and a good finder (8x50 right angle finder and/or [Telrad](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif)) make it very easy.

http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z8-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope

I have a GoTo mount (SLT, 4" Mak &amp; 5" Reflector) and don't use it as often as I thought I would. I use my manual (larger) telescope more frequently. GoTo does not make everything easier. 

[Random link](http://nightskyinfocus.com/diyprojects/push-to-telescope/) on Phone as "Push to" solution. But it's really not difficult to look at a phone/map and align the finder as shown on the map/screen.

In the ~4" telescopes you chose most objects will look faint or are invisible, while a 8" can show the spiral structure of some galaxy, shows more details on planets (the 114az is not good for planets and even the 4se is limited).Well, it seems like you have already settled on these despite for asking if they are a good choice, so any further discussion is pointless :-) Light pollution filters have very limited effect. None of these telescopes are ideal for very faint objects. Planets are bright enough to view as-is, even from within the city. Long eye relief eyepieces: [1](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/), [2](http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/) - Don't push the magnification on either of those telescopes. A last-generation smartphone costs &lt;$50.


Have fun with your telescopes, clear skies!


//Edit: By the way, the short aperture ratio 114az is much more dependant on colimation than a 6 or 8" $275-$315/$399 long reflector ever would be, and it's easy.I don't know what's available in Polish, but you can download a free PDF of Stellarium IIRC and take a look at it. Paper version  + red light works better though... How did you wire things up?

Even if the module uses more amps,   the Arduino's 3.3v max. rating of 50mA should be way above what a button cell could ever supply :-).

Have you tried just using a digital pin (plus resistor) on the "open" end of the switch, instead of the optocoupler?
Edit: 12v, http://www.amazon.com/FLOUREON-6-12V-Hobby-Brushed-Controller/dp/B00PDC06EU/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449359089&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=esc+320a+12v, $10 at Aliexpress, worth a try?

Not sure about this one; http://www.amazon.com/SkyQ-Brushed-Speed-Control-Programmable/dp/B00NPLPTH0


How about a big mosfet [at least something like [this](http://reprapworld.com/?products_details&amp;products_id=333#.VmNuuSvsrIU)]? (Better larger, never use anywhere near the max. specs! Heatsink! Depending on the typical current)
Same power-source or two with common ground?

Does it work when you power it via the 3.3v from the Arduino and push the switch?



Transistor could work as well.

Also, Depending on what quality you need and what for, 

 - http://highlowtech.org/?p=1963

 - but of course better https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SimpleAudioPlayerIf you can handle a 12" that would be awesome. It's huge though. :-)

You will need at least three, four decent eyepieces and ideally a better finder, but of course you can upgrade later.

The same money will buy you a smaller computerized mount. Or barely the 12" "intelliscope" without accessories. IMHO Telrad &amp; Maps (and a cheap old &lt;$50 smartphone in case you can't find something) work quite well and cost a fragment.

//Edit: Strange Canadian telescope market ;-) Some of the manual 12" telescopes cost more than the 12" intelliscope. Weird! But I don't know much about the market over there. If all fails, a 10" is still very nice...
Dobsonians are not suited well for astro photography. They typically have no motorized tracking, and are an ALTitude/AZimuth mount, not Equatorial (which is required for long exposures). 

You can take images of the planets as they require short exposures only. With a good finder scope and a decent camera, you can take dozens/hundreds of frames and stack them in Software.

Some snapshots of brighter deep-sky objects are possible.

.

Imaging has completely different requirements. A **sturdy** equatorial mount. Almost every telescope+mount bundle is not stable enough for serious imaging. You can easily spend as much on the mount as the telescope or more. Even one of the smallest equatorial mount suited for imaging costs over \u20ac300 with motor (e.g. the NEQ3), and a short 5" telescope will already be pushing stability (though some use it with a 6").

.

Getting a telescope for both imaging and visual observing will result in a foul compromise, especially with a limited budget. For visual, you'll need a large aperture. For imaging, you don't necessarily. A precision tracking mount is more important.

 - [Imaging with just the camera lens on a relatively simple/small barn-door tracker](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY)

If you want to get into imaging, start with a fixed tripod and shorter lens. No telescope. Milky way, Andromeda, star trails, Plejads and other clusters/nebulae.

Consider a barn-door. -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce

Many have a large manual telescope and a small imaging mount. E.g. a 10" dobsonian and a small 3" on NEQ3 mount set-up will be cheaper than a weak 8" equatorial. Both are good sources. Aliexpress has $1.79 Nanos. Working fine so far as well :-)&gt; spend every disposable dollar they have on their hobbies.

Pretty much this. ;-) 

I just have a smaller job at the moment &amp; volunteer at a local school. I get by somehow.

My hobbies pretty much have become a bigger part of what I do these days.


So I end up spending most of my money on my hobbies, but only to share the experience with the students (e.g. I bought 20 robot sets so each student can work on a project; Bought another two 3D printers so we don't have to share just one; Bought 5 refurbished  telescopes to use with groups at night).  

From an economical, self-centered stand-point, it's not smart (=stupid). I make less then welfare would pay over here ATM! 

But if I wouldn't, I could not do what I do. The school has little money for such things (difficult district), and I'd rather pay for materials than not being able to work on exciting projects with them. I want to challenge them, give them a chance to work on interesting projects, and not just doodle or make macaroni art as some do :-P 

It's a rewarding activity and I don't need much for myself. It has given a meaning to my life somehow.

The only down-side: My SO scolding at me when I (once again)  took all pliers/screw-drivers from our little household (or the bike air pump... oh, the air pump for the bottle rockets...) to use them for school projects and left them there over the week-end ;-)

.

Sometimes I wish I had a bigger budget to just buy this or that, but I find creative ways to get things done cheap; Build stuff myself or shop for used equipment. Got a working projector for 11\u20ac, built half a dozen stopmotion-studio boxes, working on a collapsible miniature planetarium... It never gets boring! :-)

Of course saving is important. And buying something for yourself is nice once in a while. But sharing with others can be even more rewarding. And I feel like I might leave a small dent in this world somehow :-) I got girls interested in technology (it's a shame there are still classes just for boys or just for girls here!), inspired students to proceed in education and not just dropping out, and showing them how easy it is to build something yourself or let your imagination run free when making a own animation. 
I end up spending too much money there for parts, especially since doing electronic courses with kids :-) You put a lot of 1-5 dollar items in your cart, finding more and more that would be nice to have, and then end up with a $300 shopping cart somehow, having to remove most of it again.  ;-)



What still puzzles me is that the price of the bare micro controller compared to the Mini/Micro, even in quantities of 50.  It's just 30 cents for the whole board, basically.Heh, same for me, I would probably have proceeded a different path. Some teachers I had back in school where plain unmotivated and mean, how people like that end up at school puzzles me. 

But after a change in career, here I am, doing the best I can and having fun with it. I worked in IT before and it was exhausting. It still is, but it's also rewarding. 

Luckily I am not a *real* teacher, I can basically do whatever I want ;-) E.g. I saw a Youtube video about shooting hundreds of  film can rockets simultaneously, so that's what we did. Because we can. 
Or students asked me to build robots, so I read up how to do it, bought stuff, and we build them.  Or they wanted to build a ping pong ball launcher after seeing it on Youtube, so I brought two strong motors for the next week ;-) Does it always have educational value? Not on first sight, but building things, learning about physics the fun way, and learning how to solve problems is at least as important as Trigonometry.


It's fun to see what student come up with if you let them. Sadly it usually takes a while to get them out of their "school mode" and think creative by their own without having to assign them a topic.

I'm in Germany, but experienced the American school system as well, it's just the same problem everywhere. Things that are important don't necessarily have the funding they deserve. And the little the schools have often end up in nonsense (e.g. expensive equipment that ends up not being used).

I can understand teachers that just "give up" after a while, it can be a fight against windmills. Plus in my case, it doesn't help that some teachers think less of the people like me that "just do the project stuff".  I tried to get a few teachers involved in using robots for math &amp; art project week, but there was little interest as it would have involved time to plan &amp; prepare. Luckily some other teachers are open minded and more dedicated, so I was able to make a nice alternative project anyway.Hello,

1.25" eyepieces will fit into 2" focusers with a reduction/adapter.

1.25" Barlow will fit into a 2" focuser with a reduction/adapter..

1.25" eyepieces will fit into a 1.25" focuser.

1.25" eyepieces will fit into a 1.25" barlow.

1.25" eyepieces will fit into a 2" barlow with an reduction/adapter.

Just the other way around will not work, e.g. a 2" eyepiece on a 1.25" focuser. There are adapters, but the smaller barrel reduces the field of view / causes vignetting, and telescopes might not have enough back-focus. 

.

That being said: Don't get the 3x Barlow. The 9mm eyepiece isn't too great, and with a 3x Barlow, you'll get 220x magnification. 

.

Maximum magnification-&gt;Double the aperture in millimeter, or fifty times the aperture in inches. Over that the image will get too dark and dull, you won't gain any actual details.

The short-ish refractor also will show a lot of chromatic aberration at higher magnification.

A barow introduces some chromatic aberration as well, reducing the contrast a bit.

For the same cost of the Barlow you can get a dedicated Wide-Angle eyepiece, with decent eye relief, e.g. 

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

...or you can get a halfway decent budget barlow for far less;

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/new-metal-1-25-2x-barlow-lens-m42x0-75-camera-telescope-eyepieces/

.

9mm kit eyepiece + 2x barlow -&gt; 146x -&gt; Probably usable

9mm kit eyepiece + 3x barlow -&gt; 220x -&gt; Too much!

:-)

You could buy a dedicated 4-5mm eyepiece, but keep in mind you'll be pushing it with this refractor. For high magnification the 127slt is much better, even the 130slt would outperform the 102mm refractor.

For wide-field, a 2" eyepiece can be great! e.g. on a budget $69-$100 Explore-Scientific 30mm70\u00b0, university optics 30mm 80\u00b0, gso 30mm65\u00b0,  q70 32mm, swan 33mm. Longer focal lengths may be problematic regarding "exit pupil" getting larger than your dilated pupil.Hello :-)

That are interesting and unusual telescope stats, what kind is it? Self-made?

Is the wide angle super 25mm this one?

 - http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/language/en/info/p3964_SUPER-RK-eyepiece-set-25mm---10mm---three-element.html

That's not a bad eyepiece or anything, but it's not really super nor wide-angle ;-) [A True low magnification wide-angle eyepiece can be nice to have](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) (Random links [1](http://www.bintel.com.au/Eyepieces-and-Barlows/Bintel-/Superview/Bintel-SuperView-42mm/364/productview.aspx), [2](https://www.myastroshop.com.au/products/details.asp?id=MAS-004E)). Do you have a 2" focuser on that telescope?

Anyway, back to your question!  Your 10mm + 2x barlow should give you 200x magnification, around the maximum usable on average seeing conditions. Of course if it's a really cheap kit eyepiece and a plastic-y barlow, it might not be really good contrast-wise. Still, you should see the rings of Saturn and at least two cloud bands of Jupiter. Mars will be difficult depending on the conditions, and the others are mostly feature-less.

.

The "gold line" 66\u00b0 eyepieces are nice budget eyepieces (no name variant from Orion Expanse), but only available down to 6mm; Links [[1]](http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-6mm-1-25-super-wide-angle-eyepiece.html), [[2]](http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-ultra-wide-angle-eyepiece.html). 166x will still show the planets small-ish, but you should be able to see 95% of all details, and it'll work in sub-par seeing conditions :-)

While they aren't available as 4 or 5mm, you could consider using the gold-line with the "[Astro Zoom](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?)" if you have a 2" focuser or use some sort of tube extension. Many modern eyepieces have basically a barlow-element built in in the bottom barrel, and the Astro-Zoom changes the distance between eyepiece and bottom lens, which results in a change of magnification. It's not a wide range zoom, but compared to zoom eyepieces, the apparent field of view does not get smaller. I have one and it's really a great way to always adjust to the maximum magnification possible without having to buy three or four eyepieces of short focal length! :-)

Some experience a bit of "kidney beaning" with the 6mm, I never have issues though when using the eye cup. It still performs so much better than kit eyepieces and can compete with some more expensive eye-pieces despite their low price.

.

There are also the  HR Planetary; They have a 58\u00b0 apparent field of view (slightly more than the kit eyepieces but not all that wide-angle) and available in a wide range of focal lengths; E.g. 4-5mm, so 200-250x magnification (more won't be possible on average seeing conditions).  [Random Link](http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/), not sure where to get them cheap over there.
 
.

Saxon and [Astropetes](http://www.astropetes.com.au/accessories.html) has Saxon store-brand 68\u00b0 wide-angle eyepieces. The 68\u00b0 afov and SWA label suggests that they could be Erfle-type. I do not know anything about their quality!  3.5mm will be too much for average seeing conditions, 5mm will work nicely. ASK how long their eye relief is though. I know simpler Erfle that have incredibly short eye relief for their &lt;12mm versions.

.

William Optics UWAN are neat ultra-wide-angle eyepieces, but [over budget](https://www.myastroshop.com.au/products/details.asp?id=MAS-056B).

.

Baader Hyperion are also an option, but almost as expensive as the William Optics and 68\u00b0 is smaller (but still decent).

.

Shorter Pl\u00f6ssl are cheap but have horribly short eye relief.

Very good information from /u/CarolOKlaNOLA ! :-)

Even when there's no meteor shower you can spot a few than and when. I always see one or two when out with the telescope and just looking up with my eyes.

A telescope won't show images as seen on images, as our eyes are not quite as sensitive. But that does not make it less amazing! :-) Seeing the rings of Saturn for your first time, spotting your first faint galaxy or even see one with spiral structure is mind-blowing.

Do you have binoculars? Many nebulae, star clusters and galaxies can be seen at low magnification! Jupiter's moons or the phases of Venus as well.

Even with the naked eye you can see a few nice things, e.g. the international space station passing,  the Plejads, the Orion nebula, or under truly dark skies even the Andromeda Galaxy...

Consider buying "Turn left at Orion", it's a great guide for visual, binoculars and small to medium telescopes. It won't only show you where to find objects, but also what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, and has pictures on what to expect! :-) Also, with a dim red light, it'll preserve night-vision better than an app on a  back-lit display.

Before purchasing a telescope make sure to visit /r/telescopes. There's a telescope for every budget out there, but also a lot of garbage despite some having good reviews :-) I started with a used &lt;$20 telescope and got hooked. The only regrets so far is that I did not get one sooner and that it can be an expensive hobby if you get bitten by the aperture bug. 

Clear skies, keep looking up.Hello :-)

They both are nice telescopes, but rather different.

For one thing, Aperture is key.

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

Then it depends a bit what you want  :-)

 - a manual telescope or GoTo telescope (GoTo will leave you with a smaller aperture for your money, and it's not making everything easier, "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo manual and finding things with a decent finder not hard)

 - The 8SE is a Schmidt-Cassegrain; It's type has a longer cool-down time before you can use high magnifications, it's longer focal length will show a smaller maximum field of view 

 - The mount requires power, it can be annoying  if you are out on the field and have to head back home.

 - If you/he consider astrophotography, the long focal length and type of mount is not ideal for deep-sky &amp; long exposures, but a bit is possible of course.
 


As you wrote, size can be an issue; Measure. There are also the more portable Sky-Watcher collapsible/Flextube, Meade lightBridge and Explore Scientific truss tubes, though a full tube has some benefits, too.

A telescope is a very personal matter. It might be a good idea to invite him to visit a astronomy club / society / meet-up first, and give him a "coupon", book and binoculars for christmas.

Many people, including me, buy a telescope and discover they want something different along the way. No amount of reading will save you from discovering that you have different requirements from what you've first thought. :-)

If he likes to star gaze with the naked eye or binoculars, he will probably enjoy the manual telescope as well; The Zhumell telescopes have pretty good accessories, unusual for most kit telescopes. Only one or two more eyepieces (e.g. [6mm/15mm](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/)) are required to be set for years.

The 8SE is a compact (but not small) telescope. It's a nice piece of technology and will show a lot. 8" shows a bit less regarding deep-sky, but it's still amazing, not only but especially for planets. A good 9mm eyepiece would be beneficial, and one for the lower magnification range (though the mount does the finding)...

If your boyfriend is a nerd and more the casual star gazer (e.g. when the planets are up, not as much into chasing faint fuzzy deep-sky objects all the time) the 8SE will be great. But so would be a 6se or a Celestron 127 SLT :-)

There are a lot of nice telescopes, none of them being better. They all have ups and downs, and different uses. Portability, targets, cost, imaging... A lot of things to consider. Especially imaging has completely different requirements.
This.

Also, you would have to use something that's able to travel long distances, possibly pass atmospheres and gas clouds, and easy to find!

Radio waves are "simple", so other life would probably discover how to detect it. The hydrogen line would be a frequency advanced civilizations know, it's "less noisy".

But who knows! Perhaps we haven't discovered subspace communication yet. Or forms of communication using  quantum entanglement. 

A Type II/III civilization on the Kardashev scale could also modulate the light of multiple stars or a whole galaxy to send a "Hello, we're out here" signal, that would be hard to miss for nearby civilizations. But the problem of *slow* light speed and detecting a civilization rising in the same time frame as ours prevail.  Oh that's so neat!

Slightly OT:

I had a  Gakken   Gramophone Kit but gave it away due to lack of time building it, and it went out of stock later. :-(

(There are now some deluxe sets of it available, but it's incredibly expensive over here. Anyone knows where to get the old one or a guide on how to replicate something like that?)

No need to make two topics; The 70az will beat the smaller one in every regard, as the short simple refractor will show a lot of chromatic aberration at higher magnifications (reducing the contrast).


Andromeda and Orion nebula are even visible to the naked eye if the sky is dark enough. These objects are easily spotted with binoculars, as well as other galaxies or nebulae.

70mm / 3" telescopes are rather limiting for both planets and deep-sky. The 70az is on a usable mount, which most telescopes in this price segment aren't.

Other options within your budget include the [Orion SkyScanner 100mm](http://www.telescope.com/catalog/search.cmd?form_state=searchForm&amp;siteCode=US&amp;keyword=100+skyscanner) (sometimes on sale refurbished for $93 there; The aperture ratio has a few flaws, but especially for deep-sky it'll show more, though maximum magnification is limited as well).

You can also get the Celestron Powerseeker [114](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=sr_1_1_olp?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433351751&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=114+900&amp;condition=new)/900eq for $110-$130 depending on the current deals. Don't confuse with the short 114/1000 and 127/1000 which have optics with flaws. The problem with the 114 reflector on EQ1 mount is the stability. The mount is way to weak, it will shake a lot when focusing and tracking. Otherwise the 114/900 will outperform any of the telescopes in this price range. You can often get a 114/900 used for under $50 and build a simple rockerbox mount for $5. This would give you the best bang for the buck. I did it with 5th graders and it was fun to build.

Also consider the Celestron c90. It's $159 now though, it was available for $130 or so a few times; It's a great spotting scope and outperforms the small 70mm refractor.

What area are you from? 

Aperture is key;

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

...followed by a sturdy mount an decent eyepieces ;-)


Sadly a lot of compromises have to be made under ~$200, you get what you pay for. 

Maintenance -&gt; Reflectors do need collimation, but it's neither as big of a deal as some sites make it seem (look through, turn three screws until everything appears centered) nor is it required every time, especially for the longer reflectors.

Accessories -&gt; Especially the short cheap telescopes rarely have eyepieces for high magnification, partially because many tend to not perform well at high magnifications (chromatic aberration / spherical aberration &amp; obstruction). And in general, kit eyepieces are very basic anyway. This will add to the cost. $22 or so for a barlow, or better yet, ~$35-$40 for a dedicated eyepiece. Let me know how it turns out :-) Which one would you build? Phonograph?Hello again :-)


Odd! I am familiar with Sky-Watcher, but never seen a 6.5" with 1000mm focal length? I know they had a shorter 8" once (200/1000), but never seen a 6.5"? Does it really say 6.5"/165mm on the tube's label? Or is that the outer diameter perhaps?


//Edit: Ah, 6" 1000? http://www.astrobin.com/gear/15928/skywatcher-explorer-150mm-f66/You will have to know how many amps the motor is drawing.Hello :-)

Great! :-) That's definitely a good thing. 

Depending on the amount of light pollution, you could also get the $35 Celestron Cometron 7x50 binoculars or some 10x50 (if you don't have binoculars already), "Turn left at Orion" and stargaze with that :-) A lot of things are visible in binoculars already (Jupiter's brightest moons, Venus phases, a bunch of galaxies and nebulae, star clusters...). With TLAO you'll learn how to navigate the sky.

Also, currently the Sky-Watcher dobsonians are on sale and the Zhumell z8 is about to restock, and of course the other options mentioned are still up to date. 

What area are you from? I could look at CL.Good luck with your project! :-)Oh, by the way, I just remembered seeing [how to replicate Bell's telephone using a membrane, wire &amp; salt water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijvEJlmSO3E); This might be of interest to you; If not, sorry for bothering :-) Hello :-)

Hello :-)

The StarBlast 6" is a nice table-top, and shows a bit more than the AWB Onesky / Heritage 130p (5").

But for the same price you can get a 8" dobsonian that'll show more. Even the longer 6" dobsonian has benefits when observing planets for example. Also affordable eyepieces won't perform as well in the shorties (due to the aperture ratio of F/5).


 - [SW 6"](http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-6) Needs 2" eyepieces for a larger field of view, but overall better optics due to smaller obstruction and benefits of the aperture ratio

 - [SW 8"](http://www.telescopes.com/products/sky-watcher-traditional-dobsonian-7); Cheaper, larger aperture!

.

If you can increase your budget a bit, consider the z8; It costs $399 but the accessories alone are worth it; E.g. dual speed focuser, right angle finder scope, collimation tool, moon filter, 2" wide angle eyepiece (which alone is worth $70!). Most other telescope sets have very basic accessories.

How dark is your observing location? What do you plan on observing?

To get the most out of the telescope, ideally you should get a decent "planetary eyepiece" (e.g. [6mm](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/), more magnification is possible, but atmospheric seeing condition often limit it), perhaps one for mid-range/deep sky (e.g. 15mm).

"Turn left at Orion" - the missing manual on how to find objects, how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, and what to expect :-)

Ideally, a height adjustable chair, $20 ironing chair if you can find one on sale.How important is portability for you then?Then go for it :-)A real NEQ3 or EQ-3-2 would be fine :-) But some of those sets come with relabeld EQ2 or Astro3 mounts... I've even seen them being sold as "EQ9" once :-)Hello!

Pretty much what /u/FDlor wrote :-)

The difference aperture makes:

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

A smooth, rigid dobsonian mount will beat a weak equatorial mount. 130/650 on EQ2-ish mount can be tollerated, but it's not great.

Deep-sky is often observed at lower to medium magnification. Tracking with a wide-angle eyepiece is not a big deal.


You can get a Sky-Watcher 8" Dobsonian for $315, but the Zhumell z8 ($399) already includes accessories that you will buy sooner or later anyway.

8" will fit in most cars (back-seat). For backpacking, even the 130st will be too much. The AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p outside the US) will be the largest in this price range you can transport.

Imaging is limited with a dobsonian. But it also is with a 130st! Brighter object such as planets can be imaged with dobsonian and a good finder (e.g. the Skywatcher or Zhumell come with one). You will get a blob with little details mostly, but if you practice and find the right settings, stack multiple frames, you can get results like this:

 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnKa9U7Qgw

But keep in mind imaging at night is completely different to day-time imaging. You don't just point+shoot and get amazing results.

There's also the Celestron 130eq MD (Motor drive). It suffers of the same stability issues the 130st has. But you can use the mount without telescope for wide-field and possibly get results like this with just a (good) lens;

Or just get the dobsonian and build a barn-door for that;

Getting one telescope for imaging and observing, especially on a budget, results in some sort of compromise. For visual, you need a big aperture. For imaging, the mount is more important. Most sets are even too weak for visual :-)

Also, for magnifications ~200x get a wide-angle eyepiece, e.g. the "gold line" 66\u00b0 from Corvus optics or Aliexpress, $24-$35, or others for  $40-$100+.Don't start with a big, long focal length telescope. Equatorial for deep-sky. Have you done some fixed tripod imaging of the night sky yet? What do you want to take pictures of? Also, what yawg6669 wrote :-) The astrophotography Wiki has a lot of resources.

https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescopeHello :-)


Don't get a Barlow. Get decent modern eyepieces. They have a long eye relief, a large eye lens, and show a larger apparent field of view; Budget barlows will have some chromatic aberration, reducing the contrast. Combine them with kit eyepieces, and it just does not perform as well as a dedicated eyepiece.

http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png

E.g. the ~4.5mm HR Planetary, 

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

They cost little more than a decent Barlow, and have a bit more apparent field of view than a Pl\u00f6ssl or kit eyepiece.

200x is fine with a 4.5", at least for planets. For deep-sky, 2-3mm exit pupil and 1mm exit pupil are more versatile. 1mm will already  show the most details on planets for example, but personally, I do enjoy a bit more magnification. Just don't push it. 230 for example will be possible, but not be beneficial.
The exit pupil get's smaller than 0.5mm if you go above the mmx2 or inx50 rule. The image will get very dark, floaters become an issue, too.Not knowing the type and quality of the Barlow, I would guess it's one of the "bottle-necks" when you try to observe the planets.

Ask about the Saxon 68\u00b0 eye relief (without glasses it should be at least 10mm, with glasses at least 15mm to observe comfortably). The 5mm will give you 200x which will work most of the time if the Seeing conditions are not bad, and the image won't be as dim as if you try to go higher. (edit: 20mm eye relief according to [this](http://www.astronomyalive.com.au/saxon-5mm-68-swa-telescope-eyepiece-1-25.html), the prices of this eyepiece vary though, shop around)

If you can live with ~167x magnification, you could also go with the 66\u00b0 "gold line"; It will give you around 1mm exit pupil, so the image isn't as dark as, say, at 250x, and it will work under typical seeing conditions. 1mmEP&amp;167x  already shows you 95% of all details on the planets, despite them being still a bit small.

Invest the rest of your money in a 15mm gold line and/or a good overview eyepiece if you are into deep-sky observing. More magnification is not beneficial on many deep sky objects as they are faint. A good magnification/contrast ratio is more important.

Or if you focus on planets mostly, get one of the 82\u00b0 ultra wide angle ones :-)Keep in mind a dedicated eyepiece will perform better though than combining a kit eyepiece with a budget barlow, as intriguing as the concept of "doubling" all your existing eyepieces might sound.It will work, but 6mm eye relief is rather short and viewing uncomfortable. 52\u00b0 is OK but objects will wander out of the view rather quickly.

Are you from the UK? You can get the mentioned eyepieces over there as well.

Don't push the magnification. You won't gain anything and atmospheric seeing conditions limit how high you can go on most days anyway. 200x is a good compromise.

The 6mm gold line have a larger apparent field of view, but that's the shortest of the series unfortunately. Other wide angle eyepieces cost a bit more than the gold line or hr planetary.

Well, that's the spirit! :-)

Have you observed the planets with the 10mm eyepiece? They should be relatively small at 90x but you should be able to spot a bit of detail.

For the 4.5" 900mm telescope I'd get 

 - Something around 150-200x for planets

 - 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl ($22.50) for the largest field of view with a 1.25" focuser, or the 25mm kit eyepiece if you manage with that

 - One or two decent wide-angle eyepieces in-between (e.g. [gold-line](http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/), especially for deep-sky mid-range is more useful than high magnifications, as the image won't get as dark)

Given the Orion xt4.5 comes with 25mm and 10mm eyepiece, I would get the 4.5mm for planets and perhaps the 15mm gold line, upgrade the others after you've seen the difference of the eyepiece types :-)


Often seeing conditions limit the magnification. And also, visual observation requires patience and a good observing location (e.g. no warmer air rising from buildings, no light pollution for deep sky observing). The visual impression will differ from imaging, as cameras can take long exposures, computers can stack &amp; edit images.

Do you have a guide such as "Turn left at Orion"?Hello :-)

9 is young (though there's never too young :-) !), and depending on how dedicated she is, if she is going to use it alone **or with help**, there are different options.

For a younger child the AWB Onesky is great. 

But of course a 8" can last a life time and [[Shows more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)] :-)

If you are going for the 8", consider the Zhumell z8, as it has much better accessories (the 2" wide angle eyepiece alone is worth it).

The 8" dobsonian breaks apart in tube and base, weighing around 10kg/22lbs each.



Regarding size:

.

GoTo *can* be nice, but limits you to a smaller telescope... And Set-up is not fail-proof either. She'll have to know about the night sky anyway, and then finding things manually is easy and fun :-) "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the GoTo manual of the (otherwise nice) Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 for example.


As mentioned, a good book/map is necessary. "Turn left at Orion" - Or "Simple stargazing" perhaps for a younger child. Together with a dim red light they'll preserve night vision better than an app, and they don't only show you where to find the object, but also how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, what to expect...

.

The students at the school I work at (5th - 8th grade) enjoy the computerized stuff, but came to the conclusion that the dobsonian is easier to use. :-) At least with decent wide angle eyepiece.

About the AWB Onesky (quirks, accessories, mods) also see

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew

For the 8" you should ad a 6mm and perhaps 15mm "gold line" to get the most out of it :-) And the 2" eyepiece that would already be included with the z8;

 - http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/

.

Binoculars can be a great tool as they are more intutive to use, show a much larger field of view, and already show quite a bit (a bunch of galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, Jupiter's brightest moons, phases of Venus); Even budget ones can be nice, Celestron Cometron 7x50 ($35, &lt;10x power is easier to hold free-handed over a longer period of time).There's a cheap 4mm chinese plastic-y eyepiece that might work as gap filler for you. I tried it, it's not great, but hey, it works.

Though 0.5mm is starting to push things, usable magnification isn't always ideal :-)

The truth is somewhere in-between and depends on personal preference and targets.Glad I could help :-) Any idea what you'll get?Well, the 15mm gold line at ozscopes is affordable, or you could import it from dhgate/aliexpress.

http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-6mm-1-25-super-wide-angle-eyepiece.html

ozscopes hat the 9mm increidbly cheap!

http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-ultra-wide-angle-eyepiece.html


On a 1.25" focuser a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl 52\u00b0 will show around the maximum field, a 40mm Pl\u00f6ssl just has a smaller apparent field of view (around 40\u00b0).  If you're happy with the kit eyepiece you could keep using it for now, especially if your focus lies on planets.If it's not too much of a stretch the AWB Onesky will be the best deal in this price range; A bit better the refurbished xt4.5 form Orion but i's yet a bit more expensive...

I just saw that Orion has the [starblast 4.5 eq](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-StarBlast-45-Equatorial-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/99741.uts?sortByColumnName=SortByPriceAscending) refurbished which would outperform the SkyScanner 100 a bit, but neither is ideal for planets.

Regarding planets, the c90 Maksutov-type will probably outperform many of the short 3-4" newtonian reflectors.

Where are you from? I could look for used deals.The Sky-Watcher 10" collapsible has an aperture ratio of F/4.7, which results in more visible coma-distortion in the outer field, plus cheap wide-angle eyepieces will only be sharp in the center. F/5 is a bit more relaxed.

The Zhumell also include the best accessories. It already includes a laser collimator.

Collimation can be done with no tools, a collimation cap or cheshire, or a laser. Cheap lasers often have quality issues though (=not pointing straight) and can make things worse.

 - http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165

Collimation seems complicated to beginners, but with an actual telescope and a guide it's easy to grasp (especially as normally you only have to do the part where you have to turn  three screws until everything looks centered).

Side-by-side the difference of 10" to 12" won't be even noticeable to many, especially under mediocre conditions. But for very faint targets, or if the seeing is excellent, there's a tad more to see.

When upgrading telescopes you usually "skip one", e.g. 8-&gt;12"-&gt;16" as a Magnitude or so more "light gathering power" is more noticeable. 

I like the collapsible design, and I have the little 5" from Sky-Watcher. It has it's flaws though, and only makes sense if that'll give you the inch or two you need to get it into the car :-)I have a 10" too, it's a good compromise. Shows more than the 8", easier to handle than a 12" ( - cheaper, too).

Yeah, it can be quite a lot to take in! But you're on the right track. And do try it, moon and planets are easy to spot and a lot of fun to observe :-)

The Zhumell + the 6mm Gold line (and perhaps the 15mm...) complete the set, basically giving you (him) everything he'll need for a long, long time. Special filters or super expensive eyepieces can be nice, but can wait for a later time.Great :-)

Also check out https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivceI wouldn't. The EQ mount is a bit complicated for a child at this age, it's not overly rigid, and for $299 you can get a 6" or almost 8" Sky-Watcher dobsonian. For $170-$199 there are also the AWB Onesky or Meade Polaris 130, Astromaster 130.

[EQ2 Shake](https://youtu.be/3_buKdGWFRU?t=44)

Of course the equatorial mount will still make it easier to get it back into the center, once aligned. But the larger dob would show quite a bit more for the same money.Only clean if it's very dirty (and then you should consider if you should be buying one that has not been taken care of well).

Dust is not really an issue, it covers less actual relevant surface than you'd think, but looks horrible when shining a flashlight at the mirror.

You basically take out the mirror and rinse it with water (a few drops of dish soap tops), finish with distilled water to avoid water/limescale. Other gunk perhaps with isopropylic alcohol. And/Or carefully dab with cotton balls under water (not dry). 

Do not rub the mirror clean. Do not use a glasses cloth to rub it clean, don't use glass cleaner chemicals, don't leave finger prints.

Other than house hold mirror, the reflective surface isn't behind the glass but on top (first surface mirror) with a thin protective coating. Easy to damage. Micro scratches can be worse than dust, optically.Sadly not much close-by and overall a limited selection in this price range.

For planets it's either the Celestron c90 might be the one I'd go for.

The [114eq](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=sr_1_1_olp?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433351751&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=114+900&amp;condition=new) and some handiwork due to the weak mount. [The Meade 114eq](http://www.amazon.com/Meade-Instruments-216004-Reflector-Telescope/dp/B00LU1CJX4/ref=sr_1_14?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449509586&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=130+telescope) seems a bit more sturdy, but it's still wobbly.

The Celestron 70az is nice too but the aperture is the bottle-neck here.

For deep-sky, aperture is key.

In the price range &lt;$200 it's pretty much a trade-off between price/stability/optics.

There are the 127/1000 from Celestron and Meade that would be around your budget, but the optics are flawed and a pain to collimate. Only if you can get one of these for far under $50 used they are woth to consider.This. There are a few $200 telescopes but the performance is limited. Few exceptions. The AWB is a good entry level telescope, it has it's quirks but overall less flaws than most other sets in this price range.

Of course a 3" telescope can be a lot of fun too if you just can't spend more. But sadly a lot of these sets are garbage.

Used you might get a 3" for $10 or better yet a  4.5" for half the new price, and with some handiwork, these make great telescopes!

Hello,

what would you like to take images of?

For $225 the 130slt is great, but keep in mind it is not ideal for astro photography. 

The AltAz type of mount can't do long exposures due to field rotation, you'd probably have to stay under &lt;20s because of this and the mount precicion. I have done very limited imaging with this mount (but don't have the 130mm nexstar telescope).

For planets, the 127slt will be nicer.

For serious astro photography you will need an equatorial mount. NEQ3/CG4/Astroview would be the only one in your budget rande and are the smallest (and without telescope...). Over 30s you'll definitely need some sort of guiding as well, adding to the cost.

You don't even need a telescope for nice wide angle astro photography. Also, have you done some imaging with a fixed tripod?

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce

For a better overview check out /r/astrophotography and

Yes, the SLT mount will be able to take images of that;

.

The SLT is not very precice and it'll limit you to &lt;20s exposures or so. The F/5 reflector will show coma. Backfocus might be an issue. It's not ideal for planets either. But the 5" can be a nice telescope! I use the 5" a lot; Mostly manual, but occasionally on the SLT mount. But my telescope (Heritage 130p) isn't great for attaching a camera.


Visually, you could get a 8" for your budget that'll show more;

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

For imaging, the mount is the most important, but it will limit the telescope size &amp; visual use within a certain budget.

This is why many have a separate imaging set-up and visual telescope.

So the 130slt is nice, and the price is good, but it's not great for imaging and limiting for visual.Despite all the theory, personally, I can detect more details if I go under 1mm exit pupil --- a little, not to the maximum; Definitely &gt;0.6mm. The larger image makes it easier for me; But this might just be my eyes? :-)

Also I read a lot that people use more for doubles; Some claim to use insane over magnification. Though I'm not really into splitting the difficult ones myself so it's all hear-say.

Clear skies.&gt;  I doubt if a nine year old could handle an 8 inch Dobsonian.

Yes, it really depends if mom/dad assist or not (like in the other thread a few days ago).

//edit: On a side note, one of the smaller girls (10) in my class lifted &amp; carried around her friend for most of recess, so, YMMV. :-)Yes, that makes sense :-)

Well, given the price of a decent wide-angle eyepiece compared to a barlow (both $20-$40) it's nice to have just a variety.Depends on the telescope and your budget; Some are:

The Intelliscope "Push to" (it's not GoTo) is a nice gimmick, that's about it. Nothing you could not get for &lt;=\u00a340 (Android phone + App) in my oppinion. That's a \u00a3250 difference you could invest in either a larger aperture or better eyepieces (recommended).

Or you could get a Telrad for deep-sky.

.

Finding the planets is easy. Really easy. A dobsonian has a smooth &amp; rigid mount, and with a decent finder it's nothing like with the cheap kid's / department store telescopes.

My first telescope was [This](http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/info/p683_TS-Starscope-76-700mm-Newton-Teleskop-mit-Montierung---Stativ.html), which I bought used. The mount was impossible to hold steady and move in altitude without the planet jumping in and out of the narrow field of view, the finder virtually useless.

With my first dobsonian it took me half a minute to point the telescope at Saturn, center, switch to a higher magnification and observe. :-) A sturdy mount makes all the difference.Keep in mind the mount is not stable enough for the long tube, the instability can be very frustrating! Some can tollerate it, but usually these are best bought used and turned into a dobsonian ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg), [2](https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/)).

The telescope optics itself are decent. Hello :-)

What telescope did you have?

.

Conditions:

Can you see the milky way? A truly dark site matters for deep-sky, not for moon &amp; planets. As only three planets show noteworthy surface structure and aren't always up,  it's always worth considering deep-sky &amp; portability. 

.


What you would like to see:

Even a cheap telescope will show the moon very nicely with decent eyepieces.

Stars will remain points of light as they are too far to resolve, even the largest telescopes ever made can barely resolve the nearest into a blob.

.

Imaging: 

Imaging at night is very different from day-time photography and most people underestimate the complexity. What camera do you have?  What quality are you expecting?

For visual, a large telescope aperture is key:

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

For imaging, a precision equatorial tracking mount is much more important than a large telescope. Even with just a camera lens you can take amazing pictures; Have you tried imaging with a fixed tripod?

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2ttydz/300_budget_looking_for_a_telescope/co2ivce

A computerized / tracking mount will cost quite a bit, leaving you with a smaller telescope.

It is possible to take images of brighter objects through a manual telescope, but it is a bit tedious and limited to moon/planets and few bright deep sky objects.

 - But with enough patience... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnKa9U7Qgw

Pictures of the ISS: With normal computerized mounts it's not possible to just type in ISS and observe it. Some computerized entry level mounts aren't even fast enough and/or getting them hooked up to Stellarium (or similar) for manual ISS tracking is not trivial :-) On the other hand, a [[Broomstick](http://astroguyz.com/2010/06/02/imaging-satellites-a-low-tech-method/)] can work. It's not allways high-tech that gets us to our goals :-)

.

Also note that while a GoTo telecope is a nice gadget, it's not always trivial. In case of failed auto-alignment you will have to know a few basics of the night sky, and "Turn left at Orion" is a much easier read than the GoTo-controller's manual. :-)  Finding things with a good book/map (and a decent finder &amp; eyepiece) is not hard (and can be fun). I rarely use my GoTo mount but the larger dobsonian. I remembered the horrible time finding things with my first "kid's telescope", but it was actually just the crappy  finder and lack of instructions that made finding difficult :-) Modern finder scopes are either basically decent spotting scopes or modern reticle finders.

.

What do you mean by "stitching a bunch of pictures together"?

.

If you are handy, [build](http://www.reinervogel.net/index_e.html?/Plattform/Plattform_e.html) a tracking Platform for an Dobsonian, which will allow you to do some planetary imaging rather comfortably.

.

Anyway: For $350 you basically have three or four options within your budget:

 - A 8" dobsonian showing you the most visually. E.g. Sky-Watcher $315, better the Zhumell z8 ($399, but it has SO many accessories making it worth the stretch).

 - A Nexstar SLT, but it's a bit over budget and it's smaller aperture will show less. Nice gadget; Affordable GoTo telescope. HAS to be powered to use. The 130slt for wide-field, the 127slt for planets. The altitude-azimuth mount and accuracy limits exposure time for deep-sky but works for planets as they need short exposures.

 - The only real GoTo telescope within your price range proably is the [Virtuoso](http://www.telescopes.com/collections/telescopes/products/sky-watcher-virtuoso-90mm-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope). The 90mm Maksutov is a neat portable spotting scope for night &amp; day-time use, but limits what you can see. The 4" reflector Virtuoso not good for planets.

 - The Celestron 130eq-md. Gosh this one got more expensive in the last few months, was on sale for $100 less, now it's $299 as MD (Motor drive) version.  The equatorial mount is at it's limit with the 130/650 telescope though already. What seems nice on paper, is not a good combination for imaging really. But the next sturdier EQ mount costs as much as this set *without* a telescope.

 - I probably forgot someone's favorite telescope. Sorry. This is not a complete list, but a good overview I think.

.

Imaging/Cameras:

Now, you can get $10 usb eyepieces and $10-$20 holders for phones and tablets - but neither will take great images. Some modified webcams actually work rather well for planet images, but on commercial cameras, you can easily spend over $100 for good ones. For wide-field a DSLR is nice, and you can get the last-generation ones rather cheaply used sometimes.

.

Keep in mind you'll need one or two more eyepieces as virtually every telescope set out there has basic accessories. But avoid eyepiece sets (redundant, overpriced, mediocre) and zoom eyepieces (narrow apparent field of view on one side of the setting). Avoid "bird-jones" reflectors (typically the very short 114/1000 and 127/1000, e.g. Celestron 127eq).Neat, competition is good for the market :-)

I've seen them hinting/mentioning something like that on a German forum a while back I think.


Yeah, the production cost might even be lower in the long run; Less complicated, "standard" mirror... But assumingly larger packaging.

Too bad the smaller ones are F/4 and under.

There really should be competition to the XT4.5.
At least it's ensured to block enough light that way. scnr.HeliumYes, I know the 114/900 on EQ1/EQ2 exist, but they are just not good :-) The xt4.5 rockerbox must be from exquisite materials. ;-)

I kind of liked the concept of the KSON 102/640 dobsonian which sold for \u20ac99/$110 over here; The only other like this was from Omegon, they had it a while longer for \u20ac160-190, which made it more expensive than the 130p back then though.
[The FunScope is on Sale](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Sale-Telescopes/Sale-Beginner-Telescopes/FunScope-76mm-TableTop-Reflector-Telescope-Moon-Kit/pc/6/c/378/sc/436/p/103112.uts?refineByCategoryId=436).

I have a 76/300 clone, it's a nice toy, but really limited; For me, it just doesn't fit in (Binoculars for wide field and the similar sized 90mm Maksutov for planets just perform better).Oh, this. I tried collimating my 76/300 by adding spacers to the primary cell, it was tedious :-)Well, I could get it a bit better, but did not bother to spend more time on it. Like you I saw banding on Jupiter (and the rings of Saturn); The used \u20ac30 HR Planetary 2.5mm eyepiece did cost more than the \u20ac20 telescope though ;-)Yeah, observing the planets is limited. If the secondary of the Astromedia 70/450 cardboard newtonian wouldn't be so bad, it would probably perform better than the 76/300 :-)Yeah, with shipping $50...

the 82mm does seem odd. Perhaps to position itself against the many, many clones; Firstscope/Funscope/Heritage76/GSI/Coleman/National Geographic/Seben...

Yeah, the NP FS looks pretty ;-)

Another odd duck I haven't seen around here is http://www.costco.com/Celestron-AstroMaster-130AZ-Telescope.product.100119699.html, little reviews though. Nothing on Celestron's site.
Hello :-)

They do sell cameras within your budget (e.g. [this one](http://www.amazon.com/XCSOURCE-Telescope-Electronic-Eyepiece-DC625/dp/B00ZUF90J2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562579&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=usb+eyepiece)), but of course you get what you pay for, but for a few planet snapshots it's usable. But then, so would be a smartphone with an adapter ([1]() [2](http://www.amazon.com/Carson-HookUpz-Binocular-Binoculars-IB-542/dp/B00BTBPCWA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562654&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=digiscoping) [3](http://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Smartphones-Microscopes--World-check-Instructions/dp/B00SN3RMW0/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562654&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=digiscoping)) or compact camera adapter ([1](http://www.amazon.com/Konus-Digital-Adapter-Spotting-Scope/dp/B00123AVAS/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562654&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=digiscoping)) or DSLR adapter [e.g. Canon [1](http://www.amazon.com/VITE-T-adapter-standard-Telescope-Microscope/dp/B0114884YA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562809&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=canon+1.25) [2](http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93625-Universal-1-25-inch-T-Adapter/dp/B0000665V6/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562809&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=canon+1.25)].

A simple moon filter will work, a adjustable polarization filter being the deluxe variant.

Do you know what eyepieces he has?

What the stock XT8 lacks is a 2" wide angle [overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) eyepiece ([1](http://www.amazon.com/William-Optics-Super-Eyepiece-E-SWA33/dp/B00CRNO586/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449562939&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=33mm+eyepiece), [2](http://www.amazon.com/Orion-8828-Wide-Field-Telescope-Eyepiece/dp/B000M89H72/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563003&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=32mm+eyepiece), [3](http://www.amazon.com/GSO-SuperView-Eyepiece-30mm-SV30/dp/B006IKNINM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563065&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=30mm+eyepiece+2%22), [4](http://www.amazon.com/Olivon-Super-80-Degree-2-Inch-Eyepiece/dp/B00CHGMIGY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563065&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=30mm+eyepiece+2%22))


Also missing in the xt8 kit is a ~6mm eyepiece for a bit more magnification for planets. You can get a good budget eyepiece for [under $40](http://www.amazon.com/VITE-Telescope-Eyepiece-Ultrawide-Multi-coated/dp/B012IIRU8Q/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563188&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=6mm+eyepiece) or a great ultra wide angle one for [$150](http://www.amazon.com/Explore-Scientific-Extreme-Waterproof-Eyepiece/dp/B002IEXR74/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563236&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4.7mm+eyepiece).

The Orion XT8 comes with eyepieces that have ~52\u00b0 apparent field of view (see [this graphic](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AFOV_.png)).

You can also get a solar filter if he' into that.

Or a right-angle correct-image finder to replace that small red-dot finder ([1](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LWsowI5BL._AA160_.jpg) [2](http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93781-RACI-Illuminated-Finderscope/dp/B00DEOM534/ref=sr_1_2?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563811&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=raci+finder) [3](http://www.amazon.com/Orion-7211-Right-Angle-Correct-Image-Finder/dp/B0000XMVDG/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449563811&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raci+finder))...

Any idea what he observes the most? What things he already has?A 5mm will be nice for your telescope and brighter targers, as well as usable under most day's atmospheric seeing conditions :-)

The wide angle characteristics and that bit more magnification is nice. Keep in mind only three planets show noteworthy structure... But it can be nice for some small nebulae as well (though the best contrast for those is with a lower magnification eyepiece that'll leave you with a larger exit pupil).

I use an eyepiece for 200x most of the time when observing planets. Both on my smaller 5" up to the 10".Awesome! Congratulations! :-) Seems like you have a decent eyepiece palette already as well. (Any idea what eyepieces?)

Looks fantastic next to the small one ;-)

Clear skies!Hello,

those eyepiece kits tend to be overpriced, contain simpler eyepiece types (the shorter ones have horrible eye relief) and are a bit redundant. Also a 2" wide angle eyepiece, e.g. 32mm 2" 70 degree will show a larger field of view as a 1.25" 32mm 52 degree.

A 2" wide angle eyepiece for 70-100 dollars works fine on a 8" dobsonian and shows twice as much of the sky compared to the kit eyepiece. It can make finding deep-sky objects easier, and observing larger clusters / nebulae more fun. If he has the Deluxe set of the Orion there was a 2" included, but it's not really wide-angle.

A 6mm gold line is an amazing value for little money and gives you 200x magnification and 66 degree apparent field of view (compared to the mediocre 10mm kit eyepiece with shorter eye relief, 52 degree and only 120x magnification). Some xt8 sets come with a barlow doubling the magnification, but the problems with the eyepiece remain and the cheaper barlow reduces the contrast.

For deep-sky, the 15mm can be beneficial.

//edit: 
A 30-36mm 2", 15mm 66\u00b0 &amp; 6mm 66\u00b0 cover the most important things, no need for 8-10 mediocre eyepieces.

A moon filter is nice to have, but a simpler one will do IMHO, unless he's someone focusing on that object, sketching it at different moon phases and so on.

A color filter can enhance the contrast on planets, but the effect is limited and rarely you'll need half a dozen colors like in the eyepiece box sets.



//Edit: 


Theoretically, for $200 you could get a $75 wide-angle eyepiece, $40 6mm wide angle eyepiece, a [$9](http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Neutral-Density-Transmission-Telescope-Eyepiece/dp/B01220Z2BW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449580332&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=moon+filter+1.25) ND moon filter, a $10 camera or phone holder, a 15mm gold line or a decent finder, e.g. $65 [right angle finder](http://www.amazon.com/Right-Finderscope-Bracket-High-Point/dp/B006GTC9Y4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449580387&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=right+angle+finder) or [Telrad](http://www.amazon.com/Telrad-Finder-Sight/dp/B0000ALKAN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449580591&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=telrad)+Maps, and that'll give him a better variety of things. But it really depends on what he has and what he likes observing.

If you want to focus on the moon filter, get a [adjustable one](http://www.amazon.com/Gosky-Variable-Polarizing-Telescopes-Eyepiece/dp/B010UH5SL8/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449580332&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=moon+filter+1.25).


Does he have a good book or maps to find deep sky objects? Binoculars?&gt; Best Reflecting Telescopes

...first product: Celestron 127EQ 

Nope. Bye!Hello :-)

Your location will influence what you can see, though to simplify things, you just have to differentiate between northern and southern hemisphere.

Morning hours often have fog in some areas.

A darker location helps, always :-) No moon as well. It's going to be difficult to observe nebulae when it's up.  Planets are bright and do not suffer from light pollution.  But the planets aren't always up and with the naked eye they will only be bright stars. Venus phases are visible in binoculars, and Jupiter's larger moons. 

Also adjusted eyes, yes; Even cellphone apps in night/red mode can influence your night-vision due to the nature of the back-lit screen.It takes around half an hour for your night-vision to reach it's peak, and it can be destroyed within a second :-) Use paper maps + dim red light.


16x binoculars (if they really have 16x magnifications, especially cheap/no-names are often branded Falsely) are not suited to hold free handed steadily at night to observe faint targets .Consider a tripod. 

Consider buying "Turn left at Orion" or check out some "starter tour", e.g. [this](http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2012/01/22/binocular-tour-of-the-milky-way-mansion/) or [that](http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/winter.html), 


Check for a local astronomy club, or store, some have rental telescopes :-)


Check out http://Stellarium.org; It's free for mac/pc, not free as App. Night sky tools is free for Android. Just in case you get lost. You can get deep red transparency sheet to protect night vision.

What city/area are you from? It sounds like you might enjoy a small used telescope from the classifieds.Congratulations, that's amazing! :-)

What mount do you have for it / plan on getting for it?

Also, https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescope

Astrophotography on a budet -&gt; What camera, what lenses? Have you imaged with your camera from a fixed tripod? (Star trails, Andromeda, Orion Nebula, Plejads...)Hello,

did you check out the links to the graphics showing the apparent field of view?

A wide angle eyepiece shows a larger piece of the sky. This makes finding and tracking objects easier, and just looks great :-) http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png

The $30-$40 "Gold line" are just the nickname for the no-name eyepieces (that are identical to a $70 eyepiece called Orion Expanse). They are sold from various companies, brand or no brand. http://www.amazon.com/Orion-8923-Expanse-Telescope-Eyepiece/dp/B0000XMXZM - No need to pay the higher price in my opinion. 
A german site once compared brand name VS no name and the difference was minimal, some no-names even had better blackened barrels. 

It's more about eyepiece types than brands. Many brands have identical or similar eyepieces, and there are quite a few clones of eyepieces. E.g. you can spend 700\u20ac for a eyepiece, or $300 for a clone.

If you aren't set to Amazon you can get some of these things cheaper or different variants with other features.

e.g.

http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

http://agenaastro.com/bst-1-25-telescope-polarizing-filter-set-eyepiece-holder.html

http://www.optcorp.com/eyepieces/all-eyepieces-not-sets-kits/explore-scientific-30mm-70-degree-2-eyepiece.html - better SWAN33, Q70 or perhaps the [30mm80\u00b0 ultra-wide angle](http://www.universityoptics.com/2inch.html) (though this "cheap" one will degrade in sharpness in the outer field of view a bit)


Telescope accessories are a confusing, complex topic, and it's easier to spend more on eyepieces than on the telescope itself :-)For deep-sky imaging, a equatorial tracking mount is more crucial.

If you have a decent lens, why not start that way around?

Lens+(simpler) tracking mount: http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERYAlright :-) I got a used telescope for under $20 when I started, so there's usually something for every budget, thus I'd thought I'd mention it :-)

Even with the naked eye a lot is visible, and you have binoculars which is great. Just really pack warm clothing, standing around can really make you freeze quickly.

Clear skies!Earth rotates; Given where you are on this dirt-ball, you'll need a tilted mount that counters that rotation :-)

For faint deep-sky objects, you will have to take long exposures. Without tracking mount, even with something 18-55mm, you are limited to &lt;10 seconds or so.

With a 600mm telescope &lt;1 second!

Also see [This](http://articles.beltoforion.de/article.php?a=untracked_astrophotography&amp;hl=en&amp;p=camerasettings&amp;s=idFocalLength). And [that](http://www.telescopenerd.com/telescope-astronomy-articles/why-is-my-telescope-so-hard-to-point.htm).

.

With a good tracking mount you can theoretically take minute long exposures with guiding. With a smaller eq tracking mount such as the NEQ3/CG4/Astroview probably half a minute unguided depending on the focal length.

Another method to get more details is by taking multiple short exposures and stack them with the computer.

With a 600mm F/7.5 you won't be able to take long exposures. You might be able to see less than with a wide-angle lens; Limiting you to bright star clusters and moon/planets. And for that, a ed80 without mount is a bit expensive for 1 second snapshots. :-)

You could try to get a used  Celestron CG5 or EQ5 for example.

But of course there are many ways to approach Astro Photography and it depends on what you are trying to image, and what results you expect. For snapshots, even the Celestron SLT can be a nice gadget, for anything serious, the equatorial tracking mount should be the center of it all. But as you saw in one of the previous post's links, even a DIY barn-door and a camera lens can produce great results.

Here a bit about AP on a budget; http://www.astrophotography-tonight.com/astrophotography-on-budget/

edit: I wish I had a decent 200-300mm telephoto lens. I have mostly zoom lenses. A nicer shorter one though.

Another vote for the Maksutovs;

The c90 is neat, sells for $159 (occasionally $140). The down-side is the small maximum field.

For day-time use a zoom eyepiece $50-$60 is versatile, though as it's apparent field of view gets narrower on one side of the setting, fixed wide-angle eyepieces are nicer (especially at night).


I have a 102mm (4") and 90mm Maksutovs, they are nice travel spotting scopes. They are also capable of showing you the planets and some brighter galaxies, nebulae, star clusters.

Orlet, the c90 does not come with a zoom eyepiece, it's also sold with a 32mm eyepiece :-)

Another option might be 15x70 or 20x.... binoculars on a tripod (as over 10x gets difficult to hold steadily!). Zoom binoculars typically don't perform as well, even though as it might seem tempting.Hello :-)

I have a Nexstar *SLT*, so a bit different. But perhaps I can shed a bit of light on one thing or another.

The 80mm refractor is a nice small telescope that will show you a lot :-) But be aware of the 80mm aperture's limit (What to expect in different apertures: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)).

The theoretical usable maximum magnification is 160x (twice the aperture in millimeter). It's wise to stay under that as the image will get darker the higher you magnify, even though it might be tempting to observe the planets at over 200x magnification.

For visual use, a one-star alignment can work just fine. I've aligned the SLT to the moon and it was working alright.

The telescope usually comes with
25mm (36x) and 10mm (90x) eyepiece, as well as an erecting diagonal. The diagonal allows you to view more comfortably through the telescope (especially when it's pointing straight up).

The eyepieces are very basic. A 2x barlow is often recommended for more magnification, but it'll result in too much magnification. There's a "dual use" barlow where you can unscrew the bottom to get 1.4x, -&gt; 126x with the 10mm eyepiece. But you could also get a 6mm dedicated eyepiece with a better eye relief, wide-angle view, and better contrast than the kit eyepiece combined with a barlow (that'll ad chromatic aberration).

For deep-sky, a lower magnification eyepiece is more important. More magnification won't "see further" as beginners often assume. It's all about the amount of light reaching your eye, and for many deep-sky objects, that's more around 40-20x or so with your telescope.

Grab a copy of "Turn left at Orion". Compared to Apps it does not only show you where to find objects, but how to observe, what's worthwhile observing in small to medium telescopes, what to expect... and with a dim red light it preserves night vision better than a back-lit display.

For moon &amp; planets you won't need to get to a darker location, for deep-sky, you will (and ideally pick a moon-less night).

http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/winter.html

.

Also, do you have binoculars? They show a wider field of view and can help you to get oriented and narrow down an object's position, in case of the GoTo alignment fails.Hi :-)

This. This all the way.

None of the telescopes listed, and preferably from an Astronomy store. Always take in-store reviews with a grain of salt... Many enthusiastic beginners who have never compared their purchase to other telescopes.

The best bang for the buck is a 8" dobsonian. Aperture is simply one of the key aspects of a telescope. While a good refractor of same size as a reflector will have some benefits, the larger reflectors tend to be much cheaper and just show noticeable more. See the [links in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

There's the Zhumell z8 for $399, but it's currently sold out. It includes better/more accessories, especially the 2" wide angle eyepieces and micro step focuser are well worth it.

The Skywatcher 200p is currently on sale.

The Orion XT8 is widely available but even the Plus-set has worse accessories than the z8.

.


Accessories that would help to get the most out of the telescope:

- If not included: A 2" wide angle (70\u00b0) eyepiece (GSO 30mm-36mm depending on your light pollution, $70, or SWAN33mm for example). ([See a crude collage on wide angle vs kit eyepieces](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg))

- A 6mm wide-angle eyepiece, e.g. the "gold-line" ($24 at dhgate or Aliexpress, $48 from Agena Astro **edit:**Corvus optics has them for $30-$35 again) for 200x magnification. More is possible, but the atmospheric seeing conditions often limit you to 200-250x. Of course there are better eyepieces (Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0), but the gold-lines are good budget wide-angle eyepieces and have a longer eye relief then cheap Pl\u00f6ssl eyepieces.

- Ideally, a 15mm "gold-line" as well.

- "Turn left at Orion" - the missing handbook on how to observe, what's worthwhile observing, where to find it, and what to expect.

- A Telrad-finder &amp; map if you observe from a dark location. It can make finding nebulae a bit easier.

- A collimation tool if not already included, a simple collimation cap will do.


.

A 8" is of course pretty large. For something more portable, there are other solutions; E.g. a 127mm Maksutov or the AWB Onesky. If you plan on imaging - which is more difficult then it may seem to beginners - you should check out the astrophotography [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/what_telescope) and save a bit more.

.

- What do you want to observe?

- Have you used a telescope before?

- Is there an Astronomy club/society nearby, or a stargazing event? You should visit them before spending any money.

- How dark is your sky, can you see the milky way? 

- From where do you plan to observe, and would/could you drive out a few miles to a darker location? 

Hello :-)

Check out Stellarium for the computer (Free), Night sky tools (Android) for example.

There's also http://heavens-above.com/ and https://www.calsky.com/. I hope you can the z8 for that price (if you choose that option)  and that it's in working order with all the accessories, that would be a great deal.

Clear skies, keep us posted :-)It even has a TV Show. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_das_BrotCongratulations :-) 

The included 30mm eyepiece is not great at F/5, but much better then the typical 25mm kit eyepieces you usually get.

It will show a much larger field, but at F/5, the outer field will not be sharp (crude simulation  at the bottom of [this](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg))

 A ES82\u00b0 24-30mm would still be a great addition and performs much better at F/5. 

.

For planets, something around 200x magnifications is ideal, as much more is  not always possible due to atmospheric seeing conditions. But it can be nice to have one for a bit more handy :-)
 
For deep-sky, something with 2-3mm exit pupil is beneficial, so for a F/5 telescope that's 10-15mm.

.

So ideally, 30mm ES/12-15mm ES/6.7mm Explore Scientific 82\u00b0. 

Of course three eyepieces isn't ideal but covers most bases.

There's also the AstroZoom; Compared to wide-range zooms it's apparent field of view does not change; http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=astro-zoom&amp;min=0&amp;max=0 (The Lacerta are also nice 82\u00b0 wide-angle eyepieces even though supposedly not quite up there, but I did not have a chance to compare them myself; I use the Astrozoom with a HR Planetary)

.

On a budget, the 30mm kit eyepiece, the 15mm gold-line ($24 at dhgate or Aliexpress, $30-$35 back in stock at Corvus optics!, $48 at Agena Astro) and the 6mm gold-line. For that price these eyepieces are tough to beat, still nice wide-angle properties, though of course (most) of the ES82\u00b0 are a different league.  

.

Also, if you observe from a dark location and are looking for deep-sky objects,  a Telrad  ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2u1ai2/laser_finder_scope_suggestion/co4h7v9) [2](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif)) can be a very nice tool to easily locate DSO.

Clear skies! :-)


//edit: On a side-note, the gold-line can be "zoomified" with the Astrozoom as well (http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?);
I added a few things to my post, sorry :-)

The gold-line for $24-$35 are a great choice, have a good resale value, and will get you more then started. Two or three will probably be more beneficial than one ES only. But the upgrade will be quite noticeable when you come around to it :-)Hello :-) 

Under light polluted skies and for planets the Telrad won't be of much use; For deep-sky I agree though, it's a great addition.

Regarding planets and tracking: With a decent wide-angle eyepiece manual tracking over 200x magnification is not too hard. It will take a bit to get used to if you are new to dobsonians/reflector telescopes, but it's not a big deal.

With a 6mm 66\u00b0 eyepiece for $24 (dhgate) to $30 (Corvus optics) a planet will stay in the view for 79 seconds (at 0\u00b0 declination), with a Pl\u00f6ssl-type eyepiece (52\u00b0) it's 62 seconds. [Comparison](http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png). This is one of the reasons why not to get cheap eyepiece kits.

The 8" will show a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622).

Sadly the Zhumell z8 is out of stock (again). It offers the best accessories (even compared to the Orion XT8 *plus*. Though the Skywatcher 200p dobsonian seems to currently be on sale, so you could get that, add a 2" wide angle eyepiece (e.g. $70 30mm70\u00b0 GSO @ Agena Astro, or the 30mm80\u00b0 from universityoptics, or the good SWAN33mm for example).

@Komm: The TMB Clones are available from $38 or so at Aliexpress, Corvus has them for around the same price (but very limited stock). Agena Astro has them for $55.Hello :-)

I live in Kiel, right at the town-sign :-) While it's nothing like on photos, I can see the milky way here. A mile further out it's still faint but hard to miss. 

If you live near Cologne in NRW  for example that's of course a different situation. But my point is that sometimes even a few miles will improve the conditions greatly.

Away from direct light sources (houses, streets) and with adapted eyes (no cellphone display, no flashlight for half an hour) you'll also see a lot more.
.

The astronomy community in Germany is pretty large. You will find a lot of societies, clubs, observatories, where you can find people that know best from where to observe :-) 

Not knowing where exactly you're from,

http://www.astrotreff.de/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=True&amp;TOPIC_ID=135008

https://kbaforum.wordpress.com/

Check out Astrotreff.de, Astrotreff-Deep-sky.de; There are even maps of others, so you could try contacting someone nearby and ask if they can recommend and observing location nearby.

Light pollution maps can help you to  narrow down in what direction you'll find a nice &amp; dark spot, but they are not very accurate. 

http://www.lichtverschmutzung.de/seiten/karten.php
 

.

Do you have binoculars? Of course they can not compensate for a dark skies, but even near a city you'll be able to spot a few star clusters, nebulae, galaxies. 
Budget? Targets? :-)No need for a GoTo, really :-)

With the Telrad and good maps it's almost as good, minus the whole alignment procedure.

An EQ Platform can be very nice though for a dobsonian.

.

I don't know about the unspoken rules here, but as many stores sell them, I don't see a reason to not talk about them. For under $40-50 they are decent, and most of the time perform better than a Barlow in a similar budget.

The Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 are even nicer though, but cost three times as much.

I use a 8mm HR Planetary in a [AstroZoom](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?) and the only down-side is that over 200x magnification the 58\u00b0 apparent field of view *could* be a bit larger :-) But due to seeing conditions I am usually just using the 6mm 66\u00b0 anyway.

If you are setting up your phone as digital setting circle, consider http://www.greatredspot.com/Red%20Eyes%20Filters.htm as the astronomy App's red-mode is typically still too bright and not really deep-red, at least with classic back-lit displays.



Hello :-)

Manual: 

Strange that their are no instructions in the box :-( But telescope sets tend to have bad instructions with the lack of guiding a beginner into actually using the telescope.

If all fails, there should be lots of video tutorials on how to use your telescope on Youtube.


Finder:

The red dot finder is a neat gadget, you just have to look straight into it, no matter from how far away.

 - https://youtu.be/i8AeHuW1e0k?t=144

 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpEm_7wBAhc

The advantage of the red dot finders is that it does not matter from how far or close you look through them, as long as you look straight through them. Take it off and try during the day. At night you need to dim the brightness down, else it will overshine faint stars.

Also they do not magnify and do not show more stars compared to finder scopes, making it a bit easier to orientate yourself at the night sky.  Optical finder telescopes often overwhelm beginners as they show much more stars and just a small field of view.

A Telrad is a better solution (under dark skies) as it shows multiple circles that make it easy to target objects according to maps. ([Crude example](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telrad.gif)).

Or a right angle 8x50 optical finder scope. 

But any finder will let you find the "beginner objects" relatively easy.

A guide such as "turn left at Orion" for example is more valuable then investing into more accessories right away.

.

Eyepieces:

 As it has been mentioned, there usually is a extension tube in the box;

What other eyepieces do you have?

.

Clear skies :-)Oh, yes, an OLED screen is an exception as they don't have a backlight and can produce "True red" :-) If you still feel it's too bright there are a bunch of apps overlaying the screen to make it dimmer.

Yes, EQ platforms are no easy task, but there are a lot of guides and commercially available ones (though $300+ is not exactly cheap; In my experience, a wide-angle eyepiece will be a better first investment).Hi :-)

Barlow VS Eyepiece

A Barlow will double the magnification, but especially the lower budget ones will introduce chromatic aberration, efectively lowering the contrast.

The included Pl\u00f6ssl type eyepiece is not bad and will work with the Barlow.

But especially when you want to observe Planets, something around 200x magnification (more then 200-250x is possible, but only when the atmospheric seeing conditions allow) and a larger apparent field of view is nice to have.

Here a simulation of a 52\u00b0 degree eyepiece (Pl\u00f6ssl-type and many other kit eyepieces) and a 66\u00b0 wide-angle eyepiece; http://picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png

.

Field of view

With a larger apparent field of view, finding and tracking objects will be a bit easier. At high magnifications, a planet will stay in the field of view quite a while longer in a wide-angle eyepiece. 

Plus it's very nice. A wide angle eyepiece can give you a spacewalk effect.  It's less like looking through a tube but more like looking through a port hole on a shuttle ;-)

But Pl\u00f6ssl are solid, cheap eyepieces. They start at under 20 bucks and work well. One reason why Barlows are popular is because the shorter focal lengths of the older eyepiece design has a short eye relief. A 4 or 6 mm Pl\u00f6ssl is nearly unusable as you have to press your eye so close that it makes no fun.

The "Gold line" eyepieces are a good budget solution that's just a bit more expensive then a Pl\u00f6ssl. $24 in China (dhgate), $30-$48 in the US (Corvus optics/Agena astro), \u20ac30-\u20ac50 in Europe (DE:Astroversand; UK:dyejar, ebay; Fi:villenkello).

For a larger overview, the 25mm could be replaced with a 2" wide angle eyepiece; Here's a simulation on different eyepieces at a similar focal length: http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg

.

Possible eyepiece palette

So for a 8", a good eyepiece starter palette could be:

- 30-36mm 2" 70\u00b0 Eyepiece (depending on how dark your sky gets)

- 6mm Gold-line for Planets and small DSO

- one or two inbetween, e.g. the 15mm gold line which has an ideal exit pupil for many deep-sky objects.

Of course the sky is the limit when it comes to eyepieces. The Explore-Scientific 82\u00b0 for example are still somewhat affordable and almost high-end quality.


Stuff to avoid:

Eyepiece kits (mediocre, overpriced, redundant) and wide-range zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view at one side of the setting) should be avoided though. Except the Astrozoom, (\u20ac100 kit, \u20ac250 with a 82\u00b0 ultra wide angle eyepiece), it does not cover as wide of a range, but the apparent field of view stays the same and it's ideal to adjust to the maximum magnification possible under the current seeing conditions.

.
 
TL;DR: 30mm70\u00b0, 15mm66\u00b0 and 6mm66\u00b0 eyepiece for example.Hello :-)

Shop:

First of all, also check out Teleskop-Express, in my experience (and when you search around the german forums) they give much better advice then the other shop.

SLT vs Skymax

There's also the Celestron Nexstar SLT127, which has an identical telescope but the auto alignment and battery compartment are a bit better then the Skymax IIRC.

A 5" Maksutov is a nice device. It's a great portable telescope, ideal for a balcony, and the Nexstar SLT or Skymax-mounts are nice gadgets. The telescopes will be at their limit though, especially fully extended and with a DSLR attached you'll notice some stability issues.

It's quite possible to get a few nice shots of the planets, moon and brighter DSO with that set-up. But be aware that astro imaging is not simply point&amp;shoot as day-time imaging.

The 130/650mm refector version of the SLT does not have enough back-focus and is more suited for wide-field.


Down-sides:
 
The Simple mounts are AltAz (Altitude, Azimuth) tracking mounts, so after 20-30 seconds you'll notice field rotation. For serious astro photography a (motorized) equatorial mount is necessary.

Also be aware of the down-sides of the 5" / 127mm Maksutov. There might be some slight vignetting, and the aperture ratio does not allow you to image fainter objects with that set-up. The longer focal length will make tracking and stability issues much more noticable, too. Even visually, the cool-down time and smaller maximum field of view can be a downer.

If you plan on wide-field imaging, this is most likely not the right set-up for you. If you also want to primarily observe visual, the 5" will show much less then a larger manual telescope in the same price range.

For the same money you can get a 8" or 10" dobsonian, which will **show much more**. See https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

With a manual 8" dobsonian for example, imaging the moon and planets is possible, but tedious as you will have to keep the objects in the view by aiming with the finder scope. 

The upside of a 8" is that you can see the spiral structure of some galaxies (from a dark location &amp; with patience), while in a 5" telescope, they'll be mostly faint blobs. 

.

Still, a 5" telescope can be a lot of fun. I have one and use it a lot, due to the smaller size.

You can also image without a telescope. Either from a fixed tripod, a DIY barn-door tracker,  or just the telescope on an equatorial mount. See [[1](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) [2](http://www.mpas.asn.au/Astro/Tips/dingaling/dingaling.htm) [3](http://www.astropix.com/bgda/sample2/sample2.html)].
A 4" Mak is a nice telescope and shows quite a bit! :-)

Along with some decent eyepieces this is a nice portable telescope.

It's amazing how much aperture you get for your money these days.

Clear skies!What focal lenght(s) do you plan on getting?

For the longer focal lengths the Gold line or Erfle types offer a wider field of view, but overall the Planetary (or BST Explorer, or X-cel) are very nice eyepieces in this price segment.Glad I could help! I just noticed I totally overlooked your username, in Canada the options are a bit different, e.g. the cheap 8" from [kwtelescope](http://www.kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html), and the $49 gold-line eyepieces from Maisonastronomie and the 2" q70 32mm from kwtelescopes for example.

If your budget is $300cad, that will limit you to the good 6" or portable 5" dobonian; Though as mentioned you might get the 8" used (Skywatcher 200p, Orion xt8, Zhumell z8,...), and the price difference between the basic 6"/8" dobsonian ($319 vs $372) isn't too big and you'll really see a bit more with the 8". They also have the telesopes with eyepiece kits, but you're typically better off buying the mentioned eyepieces instead to get the most out of the set.Hello :-)

Is the current mount broken?

The problem is that mounts such as the EQ1 or EQ2 often cost more seperatly then some of the telescope sets with these mounts :-) E.g. Celestron Powerseeker 114eq or Meade Polaris 130eq. But the Powerseeker 114eq is not very rigid, the telescope is great though. If you can get one (used) and build a simple rockerbox, it's a great telescope.

The Az3 mount costs $99 (at least at Astropete's), but of course that's not an equatorial mount.
 

You could try to find a used mount or set (Astromaster, 
Powerseeker, ...) at ebay, the local classifieds, or a forum (e.g. iceinspace.com.au).

Instead of spending so much for an mediocre mount for the 76mm refractor, you could sell it and buy a Heritage 130p, which is sometimes available for $250aud. I know this is over the budget you mentioned, but it would show a lot more in any regard. ([Links on what to see in different apertures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622))

Heritage 130p http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-heritage-5-dobsonian-telescope.html (AWB Onesky in the US)

It's a bit low to the ground but The rockerbox is pretty rigid. Comparable sets such as the Celestron Astromaster 130eq is much more expensive and not as sturdy. There are cheap and sturdy solutions to get the 130p a bit higher (such as the cheap Ikea Bekv\u00e4m, or crates... Also see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew))

//edit: EQ1 $149 http://www.astronomyalive.com.au/saxon-eq1-equatorial-mount.html  - but that's still a lot of money for the weakest EQ mount out there. Used, you can sometimes get one for under a third of the retail price.

//edit2: 
 andrewscom has some surplus/used/refurbished AZ2 and AZ3 mounts as well as complete kits for $39/$79/...I'd probably recommend the 6mm "gold line" then, it's 66\u00b0 afov is very nice, and 200x magnification is more versatile;

4mm will give you 300x, which will only work if the seeing is very good and the targets are not close to the horizon.

I've just realized I wrote most of this stuff in your post about the z8, sorry for the redundancy :-)

Anyway, 6mm 66\u00b0

The z8 will be smooth enough to manually track with the 58\u00b0 of the 6mm TMB (clone); But 300x will be a bit tedious :-)

For more then 200x, the ES82\u00b0 are great; http://www.optcorp.com/explore-scientific-4-7mm-82-degree-waterproof-eyepiece.html But I'd still recommend something around 200x as "main" eyepiece for normal seeing conditions.

Both the gold line and the HR Planetary work with the Astrozoom by the way ([this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/171871688218?)), but not with the ES82 (but with the [Lacerta 82\u00b0](http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=lacerta%20uwan&amp;min=0&amp;max=0)). Compared to other zooms the apparent field of view stays the same.Hi :-)

Great!

The ES14mm82\u00b0 is neat :-)


Isn't the swa 26mm a bit redundant with the 30mm kit eypiece? Or is the light pollution that bad there?

The gold line are great gap fillers, and Corvus optics has them in stock again, too.

Clear skies!Hello :-)

A 114/900 (4.5", F/7.9) is a great telescope. Sadly the mount is a bit too weak (do not extend fully. Put weight on the center plate. This can increase the stability). 

Alternatively you can build a simple "rockerbox" with $5 worth of material. I did this together with 5th graders, with a bunch of used&amp;refurbished telescopes.

 - http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg

 - https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/

 - It may not look fancy, but the dobsonian rockerbox is a rigid mount.

.



Also the eyepieces are not that good, the H20 (lowest Magnification, 900 divided by 20mm = 45x) should be usable though. The 6mm will have a narrow field of view and short eye relief. The barlow combined with the 6mm will give you too much magnification and is nearly unusable as the image will get very dark. For the moon perhaps. The barlow also ads chromatic aberration, effectively lowering the contrast.

With the 20mm+Barlow (90x) or the 6mm (150x) you should be able to see a bit of detail on Jupiter and Saturn (if you can still manage to spot it), but be aware that they appear relatively small. More is only possible under good atmospheric seeing conditions and limited by the aperture. Over ~225x the image will get dark without gaining much detail.

If the eyepieces &amp; focuser are 0.96" diameter, it's a bit difficult to get better eyepieces (but there are adapters, I am just not sure if this model will reach focus with one). If it's a 1.25" focuser, you can get decent eyepieces between $17 and $35 :-)

A good basic set of eyepieces would be 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl, 15mm gold-line, 6-4mm gold line or HR Planetary (But too much magnification is not beneficial, see http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png -  200x, 225x max.) or a achromatic Barlow.

.

1- In general: Yes.

2- Planets (e.g. Jupiter). Double stars (Albireo). Clusters (M13, coathanger, Plejads, h&amp;chi Persei). Many brighter nebulae (the Orion Nebula, ring nebula) and galaxies (Andromeda, M81/M82...). Consider getting "turn left at Orion", it's ideal for  small to medium telescopes. The missing manual on what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, and where to find it.

3 - Yes, but do not get an eyepiece kit. Buy two or three decent eyepieces (depends a bit on the focuser diameter and your budget, I can provide you with links to suited eyepiece then, e.g. maisonastronomie has the "gold line" eyepieces pretty cheap, or you can import them from china).

4 - Dust does not influence the performance as much as you would think. Cleaning can cause more problems (Micro scratches for example), so leave it as-is for now. Only finger-prints, dirt &amp; pollen should be removed. A mirror is best cleaned "contact-less" and wet, e.g. rinsing with distilled water or isopropylic alcohol, only dabbed with cotton balls.

5

 - Turn left at Orion &amp; dim red light (budget: Bike tail light $1 + tape layer) :-)

 - In the Sticky  you'll find links on "how to align and how to use an equatorial mount" https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/2f0goy/for_anyone_posting_what_telescope_should_i_get/


TL;DR: Congratulations. Use as-is for now. A good book and perhaps eyepieces would be beneficial.Neat. I suppose the 14mm will be your work-horse for many DSO, so that's a good choice.

If you get the $35 6mm66\u00b0 you are pretty much set for a while.Hi,

Yes, those are the gold lines, cheaper att dhgate or aliexpess china. They are modified Pl\u00f6ssl and have a wide angle view, but they are 1.25" barrel eyepieces.

Measure your focuser or existing eyepieces, older telescopes usualy have a 0:96" focuser.

You can still get K(ellner), (H)uygens and similar older, small eyepieces, but if you can use newer ones they have a longer eye relief and wide-angle views that make searching and tracking easier. But observe with what you have, it'll work :-)

Given the mount, possible older focuser and need of accessories, you could probably get a different telescope by the time you bought all kind of accessories, this is why using what's there is the best idea. 

A book like turn left at Orion or simple Stargazing will be the most vital first step (imho).Actually under a dark skies the massive amount of stars visible in a 8x50 can be much more confusing for beginners.

The zero magnification is more intuitive, and with Telrad maps, finding deep-sky objects can be a lot easier then with the narrow field of a optical finder.Hello,

yes, that would be such an adapter.  It'll only work if the back-focus is rather far out. E.g. try if you can still focus if you would not insert the eyepiece into the tube. If you try during the day remember that relatively close objects will have a different focus distance.

If you have a workshop, 3D printer, or something like that, you could also make a 0.96" barrel.

Corvus Optics USA is a bit cheaper but shipping and import tax will make them almost as expensive as the better gold-line eyepieces.

1"/0.96" Eyepiece sets from ebay, surplusshed are usually of similar type and quality then your included, but the 12.5mm is rather common

 - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Telescope-965-size-three-Eyepiece-kit-6mm-12-5mm-20mm-Great-Value-/361394200665?hash=item5424c5e059#shpCntId

 - The MA are a bit better, http://www.ebay.com/itm/Meade-1-25-MA25MM-MA17-5MM-Economy-2x-Shorty-Barlow-Lens-eyepiece-Bundle-kit-/231616846056?hash=item35ed7098e8 

 - if the 1.25" adapter works, it opens the possibility to use better eyepieces with larger apparent field of view and more comfortable eye relief.

Right now you have 20mm, 6mm, and effectively 10mm with the Barlow, so start with that :-) 

Three eyepieces and an adapter almost cost as much as another telescope ;-)Hehe, yeah, eyepieces are really the hidden cost of this hobby.It was invented by a german and since he retired it's made somewhere else and sold by teleskop-austria.

Shipping is somewhat between 15\u20ac-18\u20ac or so for small parcels, according to their website, but you could contact them and ask how expensive it is to ship just the zoom.You can also try to find or make a spacer tube yourself, e.g. effectively turning a 6mm gold-line into a 3 or 4mm eyepiece. There's a barlow-type element in the barrel (http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=820). But with the AstroZoom it's pretty neat to be able to change it.

Baader offers such spacer rings for some of their eyepieces, so it's not uncommon practice. Baader does have a zoom, but it's apparent field of view gets smaller as well (as with most wide-range zooms, though the Baader has 68-50\u00b0 or so which is better than the cheaper ones that have  60-40\u00b0) Hi :-)

That's a nice little refractor, I am sure it's a blast, especially for the moon, planets and star clusters.

.

I don't know the brand, but there are many similar kits like this. Some are just re-brands and they all have similar features. What would you like to know?

Thanks for the image of the label :-)

It's a 60mm refractor  (~2.4") with a focal length of 700mm.

700mm divided by 20mm eyepiece = 35x magnification

700/12.5 = 56x

700/9 = ~78x

The eyepiece revolver is a nice touch! It does make it a bit easier. Some of them are even designed to make observing parfocal, eliminating the need to re-focus after switching magnifications.

 

The Barlow will  tripple the magnification and only make sense with the 20mm eyepiece.


You could get a 6mm eyepiece -&gt; ~116x, for planets it will perform a bit better compared to the kit eyepiece with barlow (offers more contrast, a larger field of view makes tracking easier and looks stunning, and the eye relief is longer, too).


Do not buy zoom eyepieces (narrow field of view on one side of the setting) or eyepiece kits (overpriced, mediocre). If you want a few better eyepieces, there are a few nice options such as the "gold line" 66\u00b0 wide angle eyepieces (dhgate/aliexpress &lt;$30usd, canada maisonastronomie $49cad, Corvus optics USA $35usd), but (sadly) for two or three better eyepieces you can already get a better telescope. Before purchasing check if your telescope takes 0.965" or 1.25" eyepieces (barrel diameter). For *modern* 1.25" eyepieces there are also adapters.

There are some cheaper 6mm, but the eye relief is typically horribly short.

 
The rule of thumb for maximum magnification (for bright objects) is twice the aperture (mm), so 120x magnification.   Over that the image will get larger but also dark &amp; dull.

For deep-sky objects the 12.5 and 20mm offers the best contrast/brightness, e.g. for star clusters (Plejads, M44, M13, M3...) and nebulae (orion nebula, ring nebula, dumbbell nebula) and galaxies (M81/M82, Andromeda...). But 60mm is of course the bottle neck for deep-sky observations (See [this](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.binoviewer.at%2Fbeobachtungspraxis%2Fteleskopvergleich_deepsky.htm&amp;sandbox=1) for example).


.

Always start with the lowest magnification.

Adjust the finder scope during the day. Avoid looking into the sun (instantly and permanently damages your eyes) even if it includes a cheap eyepiece filter labeled "sun". If you want to observe the sun, a good filter (Baader Solar visual film) is in order.

Get a copy of "Turn left at Orion" - it's the missing manual on what objects are worthwhile observing, where to find them, and how to observe :-) It's ideal for naked-eye, binoculars, and small to medium telescopes.

TL;DR: Have fun with your telescope! :-) "Turn left at Orion" (and a dim red light) is an ideal guide. Apps are neat as well but have a negative influence on night vision even in night mode. Do not spend too much on accessories, it's often a trap ;-) (spending more then a new telescope would).I mostly doodle small sketches in my notebook just for my personal documentation &amp; progress, also very crude... It does not have to be art :-) But for me it's easier to remember and reflect when I browse old observation logs.I just had a bit of programming experience (though mostly PHP, AS, a bit of C) and followed a guide on how to program micro controllers, eventually lost interest.

Students asked me if we could  build robots. So I finally got started with Arduino after ignoring it all the time ;-) A few months later we where building them.

If you don't mind following some on-line tutorials (([1](http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) [2](http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter) [3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH) [4](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/) ...)) or (e)books, there are very cheap kits available that cover most of the parts needed for the tutorials. E.g. [This](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062) for $22.50, or you ad a bunch of [other parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874).

All the components are pretty much standard and you'll find them in any book/tutorial. At the Arduino website or on instructables you will find example codes for every module &amp; sensor.

At the small workshops at school we build these -&gt; http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Smart-car-chassis-Tracing-car-The-robot-car-chassis-With-code-disc-tachometer/32359953608.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.43.g1K4nS&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_35_36_71_33_72_34_73_74_75,201560_1

A ultra-sonic distance sensor (and optionally some wheel encoder to determine the driven distance) is enough to make a "smart" obstacle avoiding robot.

The basic code is very simple and it's easy to hook up ([1](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Schaltplan-562x1024.png) [2](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/arduino-robot-Skizze-824x1024.png)). If the distance sensor reads less than 50cm, shortly stop one motor to drive a curve. That's it. 

From there you can easily ad more stuff. E.g. back up a bit before turning. Or pan the sensor with a servo to look left and right. Or ad a ESP-8266 (201) Wifi module ($2.70) for connectivity. Or a TCRT5000 (cents) reflective sensor to prevent it from falling down the stairs. Or a  1838 IR-Receiver (from $0.08) to control it with a random TV remote. Or play with a microphone module &amp; uspeech for some (simple!) voice commands (there are dedicated speech recognition modules that perform better).The AWB Onesky (Or meade Polaris 130eq) will perform a bit better due to it's aperture ratio.

The Starblast 4.5 has F/4, meaning it is a tad more difficult to collimate, shows coma (elongated stars in the outer field), cheap eyepieces will not perform well (only sharp in the center), and overall it's not suited well for higher magnifications.

A 6" or 8" (used) dobsonian will outperform all of these.Hello, 

if you do not have astigmatism you can just focus with the telescope :-) For glasses you require eyepieces with at least 15mm eye relief, preferrably more.Hi :-)

Saturn is a bit tough as it sets early, but Jupiter, Mars, Venus can be seen in the early hours: http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/visible-planets-tonight-mars-jupiter-venus-saturn-mercury

Even with lower magnification, Jupiter's moons will be prominent, they look like a chain of stars. With a bit more magnification and patience you can see at least the two center cloud bands on Jupiter.

Saturn is simply amazing. With 60x and more it's rings will be visible. Even in a smaller telescope it's amazing to see it with your own eyes.

Venus will show phases.

It's possible to see a bit of structure on Mars (ice caps, darker areas), but it's a tough one (depending on the current distance, seeing conditions and telescope).

The moon will never disappoint :-)

Deep Sky: 

Many astronomy sites have tours &amp; suggestions, so also check out these for example:

- http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Fall/Andromeda.html

- http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Winter/OrionTaurus.html

There's also a PDF version of "Turn left at Orion", but the paper version is much more useful IMHO.


A dark observing location (ideally somewhere where you can see the milky way with the naked eye) is key. For planets it does not matter.


Do you have Stellarium (Freeware) or something like Night Sky tools (Android)? These programs/apps show photographs (long exposures, stacked, edited images) so they do not represent the visual view. But it's great to learn about the night sky :-) You can even set up your telescope and eyepieces to simulate the field of view.


Do you have binoculars? They show a larger field of view and make orientation easier. When I started  I had troubles finding some objects in the narrow field of view of a telescope (often less then 2\u00b0) and I used the binoculars to narrow down the location.

Clear skies!Hello,

sadly many telescopes in this price range have flaws (stability, quality) and/or a small aperture, limiting what you can see.

The first-scope (and similar 76/300 table tops) is a nice telescope for kids, but you will soon get tired of it. Even with the accessories it does not show the planets well. With a 2.5 or 3.2mm eyepiece that costs as much as the telescope it's possible, but the little thing is more ideal for wide-field &amp; moon observations.

There are a few other options:

- Try go get a used 6" or 8" dobsonian. Less compromises, shows much more. New they cost $aud 328/$499 at andrewscom for example, you can sometimes get them for two thirds or even half the retail price used.

-  My personal recommendation is the Heritage 130p. Yes, I know it's over your budget ($240-$260), but it would show a lot more, and while it has it's [quirks](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew), it's going to show so much more then the smaller ones in a similar price range. Even if you ever get a larger telescope later, it will double as a neat travel telescope, and compared to the others it's resale value is good. There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq or the Astromaster 130eq, but they are either not as common over there or more expensive. Also their EQ mount is a tad too weak for the telecopes, but it's tolerable if you don't extend the tripod legs fully.


- The Orion Starblast 4", National-Geographic 114/500 ($169aud) or Skywatcher Heritage 100p ($150) will show a lot more then the smaller Firstscope/Heritage76. They are not ideal for planets either, but overall noticeably better than the small 3"/76mm telescope.


- You can get a 114/900 on a flawed weak mount/tripod for $200, but often used for $50 or so. If you don't mind building a "rockerbox" ($5-$10 materials from the hardware store, simple cuts with a hand-saw) you'll get a fantastic telescope. [These](http://www.ozscopes.com.au/skywatcher-114mm-reflector-telescopes.html), don't get one with a much shorter tube than their specified focal length, e.g. the Celestron 114/1000 or 127/1000. I built simple rockerboxes with 5th graders to turn a few used telescopes &amp; OTA into nice starter scopes.

Some 114/900 or 130/900 come on a EQ2 which is somewhat tollerable, but still not very stable. http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/bedford/miscellaneous-goods/skywatcher-telescope/1091190791 The shorter 130/650 on EQ2 is a bit better.

Used offers I found:

http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Skywatcher-Heritage-130p-Flextube-/252123085507?hash=item3ab3b4fac3


This is also another version of the 114/900 on a even worse mount. [ebay](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Astronomical-Telescope-114mm-Aperture-675x-Zoom-/271256840510?hash=item3f282ae93e) (or also at andrewscom) - but if you can get it cheap and really do build your own rockerbox, it's a good budget option.


http://www.andrewscom.com.au/site-content-section-10-surplus.htm -&gt; 114/900 with a flawed mount or a 130/900 bare telescope for just $99, ideal to build something yourself, or a 8" for $299!Well, kwtelescopes has the 8" dobsonian for 372 cad, but unfortunately I did not see the 6" cheaper elsewhere. I'll look when I get home. Amazon US has the 6" skywatcher for 280 usd. Overall the 8" is the better choice. I"ll report later.Wow, great :-)

That telescope can show you nice things for years/decades, while with smaller ones you often feel the urge to upgrade soon. Be aware of it's size though :-)

The kit accessories are OK, though ideally, consider getting two additional eyepieces sooner or later, e.g. [6mm66\u00b0](http://maisonastronomie.ca/en/product-category/eyepieces/?add-to-cart=316) with decent eye relief for planets, 32mm70\u00b0 for a better [overview](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg) - of course there are &lt;$20 budget solutions [, e.g. this if it's really tight](http://de.dhgate.com/product/productdisplay.do?seoproname=new1-25inch-31-7mm-5x-barlow-lens-metal-for&amp;itemcode=198520589) ). The next birthday/christmas perhaps :-)

While a 3" or 5" will show most objects as faint smudge, a 8" is capable of showing the spiral structures of some galaxies (under dark skies), and is great for planets, too :-)

The difference between a 3"/76mm telescope and 8"/200mm will be huge; ([links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622))Hello, consider a 3.2mm HR Planetary,

http://corvus-optics.com/product/planetary-eyepieces/

it will perform better.

Otherwise get a achromatic barlow. Perhaps even a 3x achromatic barlow so you can reach 200x magnification for planets.

More then 200x does not make much sense though. While 260x is theoretically possible, the image also gets dimmer.

Hi :-)

Personally I like less then 10x as it's just easier to hold steady.

You can also get a 5" telescope within your budget, if you want to see a bit more detail. I find the combination of some 6x30 - 7x50 binoculars and a telescope ideal, and it doesn't even have to be the most expensive equipment to show a lot. (e.g. AWB Onesky/Polaris 130 &amp; Cometron 7x50)

If you don't have astigmatism you can focus with the binoculars and it'll be easier to see the whole field of view.


7mm exit pupil won't really be beneficial unless you live at a very, very remote location. The sky background is one thing, but also with a smaller pupil than the exit pupil "light is wasted". So in this sense, the larger magnification and smaller exit pupil can show a bit more overall. If you just have ~5mm pupil diameter under the given conditions anyway... The higher magnification will also mean the object is larger, the ratio ep / surface brightness can be beneficial. Of course you can still observe though :-)

Clear skies! 
Hello!

&gt; you can save up a couple of thousand dollars to buy a 12" scope and mount. 

Sorry, but that's terrible advice.


That just discourages beginners and gives the impression that you can not get into the hobby with a limited budget.

Not too long ago 3" and 4.5" telescopes where typical starter telescopes. And while of course a 8" or 12" would show more, it's still a lot of fun to start with something smaller (and cheaper).

Binoculars are great, but especially beginners want to see the planets. With binoculars you're mostly limited to Venus' phases and spotting Jupiter's moons.

You can not build a 12" for $200, especially $AUD. Even the mirror costs more. Sure, once in a while someone is selling a old big telescope or the optics for incredibly low prices, but for $200 you typically get a 8-10", tops, even with a lot of luck.I do not know the seller, but I recently saw this:

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Cheapest-Android-Tablet-PC-ProntoTec-A8-7-Inch-Dual-Core-1-5-GHz-4GB-ROM-Dual/32410294092.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.2.EUBPSJ&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1

I've ordered a $30 tablet at Aliexpress before, but from another seller. The tablet I received not the best (older version), but it worked. Check the seller ratings &amp; product reviews.

Depending on where you're from split the orders to stay under tax/duty free limits. There are similar offers for ~$30-$[33](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/7-Quad-Core-Tablet-PC-Pink-Tablet-PC-1512MB8GB-Android-4-4-Quad-Core-Bluetooth-WiFi/32341601180.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.1.bTajOX&amp;ws_ab_test=201556_6,201527_1_71_72_73_74_75,201560_1).

rPi or similar, a small screen, power connector/battery will probably be much more expensive but it would be another option :-)Hi,

the 114/900 has good optics, but sadly the mount is way, way too weak for the telescope. If you want I can post the video links to demonstrate the stability issues. 

*Edit*: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlcSC7IQB0) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV92ncjF5-Q) [3](https://youtu.be/_R5_tAaI1G0)]  - this may not seem too bad for beginners, but focusing and tracking can be tedious &amp; annoying, even wind will cause vibrations. 

I'd either recommend the cheaper 114/900 or 130/900 tube and a DIY mount, or maybe the used $200 Heritage 130p from ebay :-)



That's one reason why overall the Heritage 130p beats most sets in this price range despite it's own quirks.Hello,

&gt;  (which is a good thing, I guess)

yes it is :-) Better safe than sorry.

If you aren't comfortable dealing with potentially dangerous voltages, consider something like https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10747

Another cheap "hack" is to take something like these dusk/dawn outlets and tape a LED onto the sensor (non translucent tape). http://www.amazon.com/GE-Automatic-Control-Photocell-18258/dp/B002DN2QKY/ref=sr_1_cc_4?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444844877&amp;sr=1-4-catcorr&amp;keywords=dusk+outlet (This one will be on when it's dark, so also if the Arduino/LED isn't powered. Others let you set when to turn lights on, so if the Arduino is off, it would be off too)

Regarding the shield: Look at the maximum voltage and Watt rating! Absolute maximum 48V 60W.

What lights do you want to power?Hello :-)

Where are you from, what's your budget? Why these?

What do you want to observe?

Can you see the milky way from your location?

.

Do you mean the  Orion Starblast (114/450), and if so, which one? [This](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-StarBlast-45-Astro-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/102684.uts)? There's also [that](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-StarBlast-45-Equatorial-Reflector-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/99741.uts), which is more stable.

- These are of decent quality but the 
The larger aperture of the 4.5" will perform a bit better then the 4", and outperforms the other smaller ones. But the aperture ratio leads to a lot of coma and cheap eyepieces will only be sharp in the center.

- The SkyScanner is cheap (90-100 dollars) and a nice "porch telescope" for wide-field. It's use for planets is limited, the aperture ratio has the same issues as the 4.5".

- The small 90mm refractor is not ideal for planets/high magnifications (strong chromatic aberration)

- The SpaceProbe 3 will show significantly less in almost any regards and the mount is not good. I started with such a 3" and while it can show a lot, I would not recommend it for the price it costs new.


.

What is your budget?

For the same budget there are better solutions.

- For $200 used (sometimes less) you can sometimes get a 6" or 8" dobsonian (Zhumell z8, Orion XT8).

- The AWB Onesky (Heritage 130p outside of the US), good allrounder for $199. It has a few quirks, but overall it's one of the better sets in this price range. The aperture ratio is a bit less critical, it's not quite so small, already shows a lot.

- There's also the Meade Polaris 130eq ($179) and Celestron Astromaster 130eq ($199 currently). These have a similar mirror like the AWB. The mount might seem nicer, and while it is more stable than the simpler EQ1-type,  it's not ideal for these telescopes (focusing and tracking can be annoying). Putting the AWB Onesky on a crate or box (or Ikea bekv\u00e4m) is overall more rigid.

- The Celestron c90 (compact, a bit less aperture though, easier to reach medium-high magnification, very portable; You will need a rigid camera tripod though!) $149

- There are sets like the  Celestron Powerseeker 114eq (starting at under $100), but while the optics are good,  the EQ-1 mount is not really capable of supporting such a telescope satisfactorily. You can however get these for &lt;$50 used and build a simple rocker-box for $5-$10.

- Avoid the newtonian reflector telescopes that have a much shorter tube than their specified focal length; E.g. Celestron 114/1000 or 127/1000. They have an additional lens to correct the flaws of a short spherical mirror, causing contrast and collimation issues. Not worth it, as they don't really cost less.

.

What to expect in different apertures -&gt; [A bunch of links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)

.

TL;DR: For the same money, you can get a few better telescopes these days.

Also pick up "Turn left at Orion" (The missing manual, showing you what's worthwhile observing in small to medium telescopes, where to find it, what to expect), a dim red light (preserves night vision better than a cellphone display) and download http://http://www.stellarium.org/ :-)

Clear skies!Oh, allright, I was not aware of it :-)

As mentioned, that's a bird-jones/catadiopter, as it has a  long focal length (1000mm) but much shorter tube. The additional lens will cause some issues. Also the mount is not great, even for the short telescope.

The bad review at Amazon sums it up pretty well :-) 

Though usually the in-shop reviews tend to be *too* good, as they are often written by beginners who never had a different (better) telescope. So it should never be a base for a purchase decision.


.

For $200, the AWB Onesky would be one option, it has some advantages over the Orion starblast 4.5 and skyscanner. It will work a bit better with cheaper eyepieces and it's aperture will show a bit more, too. $11, better  $24-$40 for at least one more eyepiece would be ideal as the kit eyepieces do not reach high magnifications for planets.

Other kits have more eyepieces, but as a rule of thumb the kit eyepieces are not good. Also avoid eyepiece sets and zooms (overpriced, mediocre, redundant, short eye relief / narrow apparent field of view on one side of the range)

The AWB has a few [quirks, see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew). But overall I would recommend it over the Polaris 130 or Celestron c90.

As I wrote before, really do consider some used options or a DIY solution with a 114/900 (it's easy, I did that with 5th graders and refurbished/used telescopes) :-) 

Sorry for the double reply;

Something like this for example;

- Orion xt4.5", performs a bit better overall due to the relaxed aperture ratio, not the best deal but fair; http://smd.craigslist.org/for/5265731055.html

- Sometimes you can get a 6" dobsonian for around the same price, rarely a 8" for &lt;$200). Check on CL, /r/TelescopeDeals/new/, local classifieds, ...

You can basically get what a $200 telescope can do  for $40 :-) (A bit more usable but still a very weak mount-&gt; [link](http://baltimore.craigslist.org/for/5211259506.html))

This :-) Alternatively, you can even get a used 114/900 reflector or 90/900 refractor for under $50.I like the AWB onesky, but it's not suited well for imaging (focuser type, backfocus, open tube, manual tracking, etc. etc.).  A 8" dobsonian would not be either.

The problem is, that you need a (equatorial) tracking mount for imaging, at least anything beyond snapshots. The mount alone will cost $300 without motor (cg4, NEQ3 or similar).

For imaging, you don't even need a "powerful" telescope. Even with just a camera lens a lot is possible if you have a tracking mount; http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY

Wide-field imaging works on a fixed tripod or DIY barn-door; [[1](http://www.j-baechli.ch/astrofotografie/Controller?action=GALLERY) [2](http://www.mpas.asn.au/Astro/Tips/dingaling/dingaling.htm) [3](http://www.astropix.com/bgda/sample2/sample2.html)].


Visual and imaging never go together well on a budget.

There are the Nexstar SLT series mounts (not equatorial, the smaller telescopes won't be ideal for neither visual or imaging), same for the skywatcher virtuoso.

There's the Celestron 130eq MD (motor drive), but the mount is already a bit too weak even without a camera attached.


For visual, a 6" or better 8" dobsonian will [show you the most](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622). For imaging, the CG4/NEQ3/[Astroview](http://www.telescope.com/Orion-AstroView-Equatorial-Telescope-Mount/p/9822.uts)-mount, a motor, and a good camera lens or small telescope will be your best option.

Of course you can take pictures through a manual telescope such as a dobsonian, but this basically limits you to bright objects (moon, planets, double stars) and it's pretty tedious with manual tracking through the finder.Zhumell z8 for visual (better accessories than the xt8 ... if it's in stock)

and a barn-door for imaging;

A telescope for $400 that both performs well for imaging (requiring a RIGID equatorial tracking mount) and visual (requiring a large aperture) is almost impossible.

What to expect visually; https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

As you can see a 8" will show a lot, visually. Even with a simple tracking/goto telescope (that have severe limits in this price range) the most money would go towards the mediocre electronics, leaving less for the actual optics.But we must find the dyson sphere and get Scotty out of the transporter buffer! But be careful if you get too close, the sphere's tractor beam will get ya!&gt;  No horses involved though

[Lies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula)! :-)There's also Ardublock (and Minibloq and others), and modules+dupont cable make things pretty easy. Also the Fritzing Creator kit (if you can find it), or "Arduino Adventures - Escape from Gemini Station".

Ardublock is not as simple as some other graphical solutions, but more like "real" programming. At 6 years a basic electronic set might be more fun ("Getting started in electronics", breadboard etc.... Perhaps a 2wd $8 robot chassis and just hook up LDR or something to control the motors with a light)This. Get it at First light optics, better support regarding telescopes :-)

In Europe and especially the UK, Skywatcher is the most common when it comes to dobsonians. A Skywatcher 150p would outperform any of the 5".

But: The 5" dobsonian Can be a lot of fun. It has a few quirks (see [my older post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/341o16/i_believe_i_have_my_telescope_picked_outjust_have/cqqn8ew)) but it's much more stable than most sets in this price range, while offering enough aperture.

The 5" is the largest you can transport without a car; But of course a 6" or 8" will be the best choice  (sometimes you can find them used for a good price). But the 5" will make a great travel telescope even later.

 Or get a used 114/900 an a weak tripod and build a simple rockerbox, this way you can get a similar experience like the 5" for under 40-50gbp.

What to expect in different telescope apertures  

 - https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622


Hello :-)


The 130slt is a nice telescope, the SLT mount is a nice gizmo. The 5" reflector is a great compact wide-field telescope. Of course the aperture is the limit, many objects  in the hand-controller won't even be visible (well).

TLAO shows you how to observe (depending on the time of year), what's worthwhile observing, and what to expect. It's a great guide :-)

Perhaps get some simple binoculars, if you don't have some already.

.

Of course there are various sites, e.g. http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Fall/Andromeda.html

Start with something simple, and do not try to find dozens of objects. If it's up by the time you're out, check out the Orion nebula. But of course deep-sky objects require a dark sky (no light pollution, no moon). Can you see the milky way from your location?

.

Possible later additions:  

 - For a bit more magnification and nice wide-field, 108x while the whole moon fits into view: 6mm gold-line, (dhgate $24, corvus optics $35, \u20ac30-\u20ac40 astroversand/germany, ebay/dyejar \u00a323.30), 

 - For deep-sky, the 15mm gold line

 - For planets: 3.2mm-4mm HR Planetary ([1](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-25-3-2mm-58-Degree-TMB-Planetary-Eyepiece/32340927306.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.17.eQQDJs&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_6_71_72_73_74_75,searchweb201527_1,searchweb201560_9), [2](skies_unlimited))

- 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl or ~24mm Erfle: Largest overview eyepiece for  1.25", unless you want to go down the 2" route (eyepieces cost quite a bit more).So True, the SLT is a battery eater :-) At least with spares it won't  run out of power when you least need it.



This! :-) The $22-$25 Arduino-Kits from Aliexpress are great and have most things you'll need to go through the on-line tutorials.

For school projects I picked up a dozen multimeters for around $4 as well, soldering irons and parts.

While most Arduino tutorials take you through the basic electronics, something like "getting started in electronics" or "Practical Electronics for Inventors" is a good investment, too.

There are also all sorts of components, robot kits etc., see [this link list](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874).


Other then the Arduino-site (Which has a code snippet for every sensor in the kit, if not, check out Instructables) there are also good tutorials such as

 - http://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/

 - http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/YourDuinoEngStarter

 - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYutciIGBqC34bfijBdYch49oyU-B_ttH

 - http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/Browse instructables or simply consider stuff around the house that could be automatized (Plant watering for example). Or buy a $8 2wd robot kit and make  a small autonomous bot with a ultrasonic sensor and wifi. Nice snapshot! Amazing sight, isn't it?

What telescope was ist?Hi :-) Nice snapshot! Do you have a phone holder/bracket?

5" can show amazing things, it's certainly a fun telescope. For deep-sky, a dark sky is indeed necessary, but even from within the city it can be nice (planets, moon, double stars and some clusters).

Clear skies!That's actually pretty neat and I like the simplicity!

I meant to make something similar with students (having 100 of these vibration motors laying around) but with button cells...

The capacitor and USB-charging PCB is a great idea.Hello, the 6mm will be fine, giving you 200x magnification (when Seeing conditions are average) and 400x with the barlow (in those rare nights where seeing is perfect).

You could also get a 4mm HR Planetary (though at 300x and the 58\u00b0 apparent field of view Jupiter will move out of the view quickly!) or a "Astrozoom" (either s 90\u20ac kit to turn your 6mm gold-line into a 4-6mm zoom, or with the 82\u00b0 Lacerta ultra-wide-angle eyepieces, ~250\u20ac).

A [color filter](http://agenaastro.com/choosing-a-color-planetary-filter.html) or ND/moon-filter (or [this one](http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/language/en/info/p316_TS-Multi-Color-Filter---Variabler-Polarisationsfilter---1-25-.html)) can help to enhance the contrast / reduce glare a bit. But there's no need to rush things and buy a dozen filter, you'll rarely need so many.

Sometimes even a bit *less* magnification can be useful if the planet is low to the horizon / the seeing is terrible.


- 1200mm focal length divided by 6mm eyepiece = 200x magnification
 
 - 1200/200 telescope has a F/6 aperture ratio; 6mm divided by F6 equals 1mm exit pupil

- 1200mm focal length divided by 4mm eyepiece = 300x magnification

 - 4mm divided by F6 = 0.66mm exit pupil: The image will get dimmer, floaters in your eyes may become more prominent

 - atmospheric seeing will be a problem in general.
 
- 1200mm / 3mm eyepiece (or 6mm and 2x barlow) -&gt; 400x

 - 3mm/F6-&gt; 0.5mm exit pupil, the smallest usable, but you won't win much detail as the image gets darker and duller... Even though you'll have 400x magnification.

 - Rarely usable due to Seeing

Hello,

in general, the smaller the eyepiece focal length, the higher the magnification.

But: The atmospheric seeing conditions do not allow going over 200-250x most nights, it gets worse if the planet is standing low.

25mm + Barlow will give you 96x - enough to see some details (same as a 12.5mm eyepiece).

Telescope focal length (times Barlow) divided by Eyepiece focal length equals magnification.


Use an overview eyepiece to find&amp;center the planet before switching to the highest magnification, even if you'll have to focus again.

For a 8", a good palette is the 6 and 15mm gold-line and the 2"30mm Erfle you have. You can close possible gaps later, also depending on what you observe the most  (e.g. 9mm, 20mm gold-line if you like more steps in-between, or a 4mm or good planetary zoom* if you want to get a bit more for planets)




---

*
All the wide-range zooms available only go down to 7-8mm and have a narrow field of view on the other end. I mean either a AstroZoom or Nagler Zoom.

There are also dual barlows where you can unscrew the bottom to get either 1.4x or 2x as-is. Hi :-)

None :-)

The diameter of the barrel, the field stop of the eyepiece, limit the maximum field of view.

A 1.25" 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl (52\u00b0), a 40mm Pl\u00f6ssl (~42\u00b0), or a 24mm Erfle (~70\u00b0) would show the largest field of view on a 1.25" focuser.

With a 2" focuser, you can also use  30mm-42mm(...) wide-angle eyepieces.

 - http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg

But: The exit pupil (light beam exiting the eyepiece) should not exceed the diameter of your pupil under the given conditions;

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/exitPupil_and_secondary.png

For higher magnifications, you won't need 2" eyepieces. Exceptions are a few eyepieces with dual barrel (convenient but more expensive) and super duper ultra wide angle eyepieces (e.g. 14mm 100\u00b0, 9mm 120\u00b0... cost more than a larger telescope).

If the exit pupil gets too small, the image will just get dark and lacks of contrast.

Sorry for the crude sketches, but the only ones I have on the subject :-)The Corvus optics Pl\u00f6ssl for $17-$22.50 are decent, but keep in mind under 10mm the eye relief will be very short, and while the 52\u00b0 field of view and performance  is probably better than your 70/900 kit eyepieces, they will not be a huge improvement.

The Corvus optics $35 gold line ($24-$30 at dhgate or Aliexpress) are the budget wide-angle &amp; decent eye relief eyepieces that are somewhat in your price range. That's as much "wow" as you cn get around this budget :-) They are very nice eyepiece for a low price.

Cheaper is possible (Kellner, Huygens,... old eyepiece designs with typically small apparent field of view and other flaws... or [these](http://www.dhgate.com/product/new-celestron-1-25-quot-31-7mmwide-angle/212649693.html#s1-0-1b|2186140113) chinese discount eyepieces), but if you are looking for "wow", the gold-line are the way to go. They work fine in most telescopes and have a good resale value.

40mm Pl\u00f6ssl-&gt; Avoid. It only has ~42\u00b0 apparent field of view (due to field stop and 1.25" limitations) and a very long eye relief. The 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl is one of the eyepieces showing the largest field of view possible on 1.25".

This graphic is made for a 114/900 but the field of view applies as it's the same focal length;

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/900mmEyepieces.png

.

TL;DR: Corvus optics Gold line. Possibly Pl\u00f6ssl. Do not spend too much on eyepieces due to the 70/900's limitations, you might end up spending more than what a 114/900 telescope costs (used &lt;$50, new &lt;$100)This, also note a 9v battery can not provide a lot of amps, it's enough to power the Arduino and a few low current LED, but that's about it. It also has a low capacity and will soon fail :-)Hello &amp; thanks :-)

I know Teleskop-Express ships europe wide, perhaps you can ask a quote and see if it's any different from their shop system. 

.

**Which dobsonian**

The basic 8" dobsonian costs 375\u20ac at TS/TE, and it's fine, but the sets like the  GSO [deluxe](http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/language/en/info/p1191_GSO-8-Zoll-f-6-Dobson-Teleskop-Deluxe-mit-verbesserter-Ausstattung.html) already include a 2" wide angle eyepieces, better dual speed focuser, and finder. These deluxe sets are a bit more expensive but overall offer more for the money.

The focuser makes focusing easier, the finder better than a 6x30 or red dot finder... Though a right angle finder would be even better, and under a dark sky a Telrad can be nice.

Astromarket has a good price on the Deluxe, but I don't know the shop! :-)

.

**Eyepieces**


Overview Eyepiece

You might have seen [this](http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg), luckily in an 8" F/6 telescope you can use almost any wide angle eyepiece. The TSWA32mm has a very good reputation. I have the GSO 30mm70\u00b0 and it's OK as well. Another popular eyepiece is the SWAN33 which costs a bit more. Basically they are all Erfle with slight differences. It also depends on how dark your sky gets. 

Rule of thumb: Under a sky where you can see magnitude 5 stars, a 5mm exit pupil is good. 5mmEP times F/6 telescope aperture ratio equals 30mm eyepiece. Under a nice and dark 6mag sky, 36mm eyepiece, and so on. When the exit pupil exceeds your dilated pupil's diameter the sky background appears gray-ish and not all reaches your retina. 

.


Shorter focal lengths;

The "Gold line" 66\u00b0 eyepieces are relatively cheap (two for \u20ac60 if you order them in the german Astroversand.com, not the best reputation but stuff ships fine), or [from the UK with reasonable shipping](http://www.ebay.de/itm/wide-angle-eyepiece-1-25inches-66-degree-F-20mm-/140600338633?hash=item20bc6ee8c9:m:msh2gn7dwjSZ-Sn5QI9r7VQ#shpCntId). This way you could save the additional shipping (or even order them at dhgate for $24 or so, which is under the tax/duty free import, I think it's 22\u20ac in most of europe)

The WA 60\u00b0 seem similar to the TS ED, BST Explorer, HR Planetary. These have good contrast but 66\u00b0 is a bit nicer and overall the 66\u00b0 perform well.

The GSO Superview is an Erfle and nice too. I have a 12mm Erfle but I find the eye relief a bit short, but I do not have the 15mm.

The ES82\u00b0 are very, very nice. But a bit overkill (2-3 of them cost as much as the telescope). With a 8"F/6 the gold line are nice, cost around the same as Pl\u00f6ssl, and 66\u00b0 is very decent.

Pl\u00f6ssl are decent, older eyepiece designs. But the field of view is smaller, and much worse, the eye relief of eye-pieces under 10mm get's too short.

Balows: Most common if you use Pl\u00f6ssl as you can't use short Pl\u00f6ssl comfortably. E.g. 12mm Pl\u00f6ssl + 2x Barlow. In general, a dedicated eyepiece is the best choice. More than 200x - 250x magnification only works when the atmospheric seeing conditions are really, really good - which is rare. 

Zoom-Eyepieces: The wide-range zoom eyepieces have a narrow field of view on one side of the setting. For their price you can get up to  two good wide-angle eyepieces.  For planets [AstroZoom 82\u00b0](http://www.teleskop-austria.at/shop/index.php?lng=eng&amp;m=121&amp;kereso=astrozoom&amp;min=0&amp;max=0) or  [The zoom set (that works with the 66\u00b0 gold-line](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ASTRO-ZOOM-Multi-Zoom-Adapterset-/181729527470) is an awesome solution.



.

**Where to buy**

I don't know any stores over there, you might check with a local astronomy club/society and ask for advice; Search for a (national) forum.  :-) Perhaps you can even find one used!

.

**Filter**

Filters-&gt; Moon-Filter: Optional. Sunglasses or $5 moon filter if you are on a budget. Under 1mm exit pupil I can live without a filter, so the 6mm might work for you without an additional moon filter.

Color filter can enhance the contrast on planets but not required. Good nebula filters (OIII,UHC) cost quite a bit and only work with certain nebulae. Skyglow-filters have limited effect, a dark sky is much more effective :-)

.

**Faint fuzzies**

When I got started, I was amazed and disapointed at the same time :-) Some things look amazing, some just did not hold up to my expectations. [You have probably seen the links I post all over the place regarding what to expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622). Under good conditions and with some practice a 8" already shows the faint spiral structures of some galaxies, resolves star clusters almost to their core, shows dust-lanes in nebulae, etcetera etcetera. The only way to see more is a larger aperture :-) 10" for example, though side-by-side the difference between 8 and 10" is marginal. 

.

**Other stuff**

 - A good paper book/map. A phone &amp; app is nice, but the backbit display does not create a True black and thus can  ruin your night vision.

 - [Collimation tools are important but you don't need anything fancy](http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/165). A cheap laser can make things just worse. A collimation cap (TS has one for 4\u20ac) or film can can work just fine. A good precise 2" laser costs ~80\u20ac!

 - A ironing chair with adjustable height :-) Warm clothing! Tea!

 - I probably forgot important things. I'll be back.

.

Clear skies, keep us posted!Same here, but I got it for a good price :-)Hehe, indeed! But a lot of camera stores still have some to spare. Or look at ebay as they are sold for geogaching container use :-)Well, just don't expect too much. The corvus Pl\u00f6ssl eyepieces are cheap and from what I hear, decent :-)I wonder... If he found/made a 1.25-&gt;2" adapter, the 30mm 2" eyepiece would work but show a smaller field of view, the refractor should have enough way of focus :-)

Strange. I have not used  other gold-lines than the ones I have, I never had much trouble with kidney beaning, but perhaps it's just me. I've read some complaining about the 6mm in the german forums a bit, but I find it OK. Perhaps there's some variance in the different eyepieces.&gt; stock

 I just went back through my history and posted a link to this topic for all those who where considering a z8 (which is out of stock at the moment).

The AD8 "B-stock" sounds like a great offer. The 2" wide angle eyepiece, right angle finder, double speed focuser, collimating tool and the little extras make it seem like a great deal! A few dents in the tube won't hurt anything.Not really an option with over-sea shipping &amp; duties, but a great deal for people from the US! :-)Hello :-)

 - 2wd (or 4wd) robot chassis $8-[$10](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Tracing-car-box-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Send-the-Battery-Box-For/32291913537.html?spm=2114.031010208.3.183.cQDE8Z&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_6_71_72_73_74_75,searchweb201527_1,searchweb201560_9) at Aliexpress (China), $10 at Banggood or ebay (China), $13 at Amazon (US)

 - The kits come with wheel encoder discs, so with a IR-gap sensor (Photo Interrupter Slotted) you can determine the driven distance. For $6 you get 20 pieces of the bare sensor, or for $3-$6 you can get pre-made Speed Measuring Modules for those car kits. Wheels can slip though. Another option is a flow sensor. These can be darn expensive. Some mouse sensors work, people have hacked a few common types and figured out how they function &amp; how to hook them up. Also a compass module or motion sensor might be useful figuring out if the wheel encoder turns where accurately measured.

 - Double H-Bridge motor driver module, &lt;=$1 at Ali, $2-$5 everywhere else
 
 - Either a 9v + clip cable to power the Arduino (as running it from 6v won't work, not enough for the regulator, too much for running the 5v uC directly) or a $0.30 usb voltage booster to run it from two of the battery cells.

 - Possibly a $0.70 ultra-sonic sensor. If you navigate with a pre-set course it's not required, but with one or three of those you could make sure you're on track and not bumping into something if the course is slightly off.

 - A needle. Or a servo. Or a cactus. Cactus on a servo perhaps.

Navigating a maze is actually not the most simple starting project as the Arduino is not capable of optical detection, measuring the driven distance and angle isn't 100% accurate, and so on.

 So perhaps make the  robot  a bit simpler to get started.

Avoiding obstacles with ultra sonic sensors or following a drawn line can be done in a dozen line of code or less. Or try how far you get without any wheel encoders... But as the motors never run  100% accurately at the same speed, especially as the voltage drops, it's a bit trial and error. Still, a fun task. And simple. E.g. 

    //Simplest form with delays and just motor control
    
    int MotorLeft = 5, MotorRight = 6;   // variables for the output pins
    
    void setup()
    {
       pinMode(MotorLeft, OUTPUT);   // sets the pin as output
       pinMode(MotorRight, OUTPUT);  
    }
    
    void loop()
    {
     analogWrite(MotorLeft, 0);
     analogWrite(MotorRight, 200);
     
     delay(1500):
     
    analogWrite(MotorLeft, 200); 
     delay(1500):
    } 

.

If you look at that, you'll see how simple it is, and not that much different to any other programming language. Of course this is minimalistic and does not measure the actual driven distance, just turns motors on and off (or more accurately, defines a PWM value between 0-255), and waits. 


.

Good luck! Keep us posted :-)True, if purchased, it will probably cost more :-) I shall print one and try though with my 130p. 

At least here the 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl got expensive :(I hope you found one or two things useful, have fun with your Arduino :-)Hello :-)

If you want to write for the Arduino, C++. Also start with a Arduino tutorial (opposite to some generic c++ tutorial) to get to know the different ins&amp;outs. It's actually pretty simple compared to "traditional" programming of microcontrollers and a lot of fun as you get results fast.

 For programming, there's the Arduino IDE, but there are several third party programs with more functionality.

If you are in no hurry, check out [this starter kit at Aliexpress (Chinese sellers)](http://aliexpress.com/item/UNO-R3-KIT-Upgraded-version-of-the-Starter-Kit-the-RFID-learn-Suite-LCD-1602-for/32393471507.html?adminSeq=202713716&amp;shopNumber=1516062). You will find similar packs at ebay, Banggood and Amazon at varying prices. Also, soldering station ($20-$80 at Amazon), [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/3imyq0/good_kit_of_assorted_electronics/cuhy874)... if not existant already :-)

But of course it depends on what you are planning to do; Just some tutorials or work on a specific thing.

One of the kits just includes a copy of MAKE/Arduino. So you could buy a book or look at on-line tutorial;

Hello,

the Arduino UNO is fine for getting started and most projects. You can get clones of either for a few dollars (Uno $2.70, Mega $6, nano 1.80).

If you aren't in a hurry,

Else you can get kits at Amazon, too; http://www.amazon.de/SunFounder-Project-Starter-Arduino-Mega2560/dp/B00D9M4BQU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445685889&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=arduino+kit and a clone for around \u20ac10

.

Keep in mind most cheap sets do not come with good tutorials though; There are a lot of good on-line resources though, or cheap books. (Also free english&amp;german ebooks and on-line courses)

 Do you have a soldering iron, multimeter, and a few basic components? You can get bags of them  for a dollar or so ;-) Also things like $10 robot car kits etc.

 - MarcusHello,

the AWB Onesky ($199, Astronomers without borders; Skywatcher Heritage 130p outside the US) is a great telescoope for kids. It's a small dobsonian and might not look like a telescope, but the mount is much sturdier than any in this price range. It's compact enough for a kid to handle it, yet shows relatively much for an entry level telescope. Basically similar to the 130st.

The 3" reflector from your other link does not show as much and I would not recom it. I started with something like it, used, and for 20 bucks it was good, but not for what it costs new.


If she had more interest and took good care of things, a 6" dobsonian for 250 would be your best choice (skywatcher dobsonian at Amazon). It's relatively big, has nice views of everything, and she would not outgrow it in the future.

The AWB is a good compromise.

There's also the Skyscanner 100 from Orion, under 100 dollars, it's great for kids, but certainly has it's limits (especially regarding planets, but it's still usable of course).

There's also the Celestron c90. It has a smaller aperture which limit's what you can see, but it is very, very compact, all you need is a (sturdy) canera tripod. As the image is upright it makes a nice traveling daytime scope as well!

The telescope sets on eq mount typically have a weak tripod/mount and thus ruin the fun. Focusing, tracking can be tedious, and the equatorial mount may be too complicated at her age. The sets like the Meade Polaris 130eq and celeastron astromaster 130eq for 179 to 199 dollars are like the awb onesky just not as stable. But the awb is low to the ground, tghere are several 0-20 dollar solutions that will make a rigid stand though.


Stay away from newtonian reflectors with a much shorter tube than their focal length (127/1000 and 114/1000 typically), they are catadiopter/bird-jones telescopes with some flaws.

If you want I can post a few links on what to expect in different apertures and such.


Also a good book (not sure what's good for her age in english, perhaps simple stargazing) and binoculars (celestron astromaster 7x50 for 35 dollars) make stargazing easier for kids, but the 130/650 and 100/400 are nice wide field telescopes as well (opposite to the long focal length of the c90)

Kit eyepieces are not good. One or two in adition will help to get the most out of the set. Which ones depend on the telescope choice. Corvus optics has inexpensive Pl\u00f6ssl and the 66 degree wide angle gold line for 35usd which are awesome for their price. More on that later :-)
I have about 50 clones of various types and "brands" for school projects, none caught fire ;-) Worst that could happen is that the voltage regulator decides to go "poof", but never happened to me. And it's not impossible to break an original Arduino either ;-)

The Uno is enough for most tasks, inexpensive, lots of shields and examples... But either will work! But whys use a 6 dollar board for something a sub-3 dollar board can do? ;-) Get more than one so you can leave side projects intact.I regularly order at Aliexpress and other stores, here in germany (and most europe) everything under 22\u20ac is tax/duty free. Over 22\u20ac (\u20ac26 here in germany as they don't charge if it's under 5\u20ac fees) you will have to pay 19% MwSt. Over 150\u20ac also 0-x% custom fees depending on the Taric-Number.

One problem is the CE label. Some custom centers won't hand out your order if it's missing or seems fake. But here at my local custom office it never has been a big deal. Also if you choose not to pick it up yourself you can mail/email them the receipt IIRC.

Most small orders just pass through fine, especially if declared directly. Sadly some ebay sellers still write "$5 gift" even on larger parcels and they always have to be picked up.Hi :-)

.

Where

if Astromarket has a good reputation, go for it :-)

.

Which

There are two main manufacturers and both produce decent quality mirrors and dobsonians. The quality of the 8" is pretty consistent. Not perfect, but compared what smaller telescopes used to cost, it's amazing.

Yes, I said the Deluxe as well, as it comes with 2" focuser and 30mm eyepiece.

.

Eyepieces 


The 30mm 68\u00b0 (Erfle-type) might not be the best eyepiece, but much better than what other sets have to offer! It might even be enough for you for years to come. Sure, the ES82\u00b0 30mm would be awesome, but costs almost as much as a 8" dobsonian ;-) 

It's not really worth upgrading from the 30mm68\u00b0 to a 32mm70\u00b0. The difference is not that great. 

There are also cheaper 30mm 80\u00b0 eyepieces; You can get them for \u20ac99 (only a few stores still have it), but they are also just Erfle-Eyepieces. The outer field's sharpness decreases. It basically performs like the  30mm70\u00b0, but the additional 10\u00b0 will degrade even further. With a F/6 aperture ratio telescope it's tolerable, at F/5 these eyepieces get pretty bad.

The 66\u00b0 eyepieces are basically all the same. So whatever you find, for the price you are willing to pay. The "Original" seems to be the Orion Expanse which cost two or three times as much compared to the clones. The no-name where tested a few years back and had similar quality (sometimes even better) compared to the Sky-watcher branded.

If you do not suffer from Astigatism, you can just focus with the telescope and use it without eyepieces. Else eyepieces with 15mm or more eye relief would be nice to have. The Gold-line and BST Explorer (58\u00b0) all have around 15mm, but sometimes it's a bit shorter than advertised.

.

Fuzzies

Yep, it's still amazing, and with a bit of patience and good condition a lot is possible. It's part of the hobby to try and spot more details every night :-) Else we could look at pictures.

.

Stuff


The extension tube is for using some eyepieces that require a further focus travel, and there's an adapter for 1.25" &lt;&gt; 2" .


Books; Good choices. I never owned a planisphere as my (german) book had a great overview chart. But they are useful.

The TS Collimation Cap for \u20ac4 is a bit better probably (transparent, ring, you can iluminate it with a small (red) light. In general a laser is more useful, but the cheap ones are often not aligned well themselves.


Chair: Depends if you need one, the adjustable ironing chairs sell for less than \u20ac20 sometimes at the discount stores, but anything you find comfortable.Hello,

at 8 the AWB is certainly not too big. 

  I wrote that the EQ  mount is not ideal for a child of that age.

A 8 year old is responsible enough to handle a reflector. A smaller refractor might just not cut it. Even for planets. The difference of my 70mm refractor and the 4-5" reflectors is quite noticable.

The AWB is a dozen times better than most of the weak sets, and a $15 Ikea stand is not really what I'd call a deal breaker. Especially as the kids use the telescope around the hosue a lot.

I also use a dobsonian on fairly uneven ground, both the little 5" and my 10", and I never had any trouble at all. 

Hello :-)

For 15\u20ac there's little you can do wrong with these, too bad they are showing double images though. In general, zoom binoculars are not suited too well for astronomy, especially the cheap ones.

Can you return them? Opening &amp; aligning them is probably tedious, if possible.

I have some cheaper Aldi Auriol and just looked through 3 of them in the store until I found some I liked.Oh ok :-)

Yes, of course it's a concern if she is not handling toys/gifts well, but there has yet to be a child you can't talk to when it comes to telescope. I had some of the most chaotic students handle the telescopes like raw eggs after explaining how they work and building small ones ourself :-)

If dropping a refractor (tipping over the whole tripod) there will be most likely some damage as well (broken focuser, even the lens could pop out) so I think the risk is alays there.

Of course you can do serious work with a 70mm! But a child expects to see a bit and 70mm is a bit limiting in this regard as at that age they most likely not observe faint fuzzies in 70mm and 120-140x magnification is also a bit limiting.

The c90 is a great choice for children IMHO, it's all that compact form factor and closed system, while useful during the day. Of course a 70mm refractor will be useful during the day, but taking a c90 or a 70/700 / 70/900 sight seeing is another thing :-)

The problem with a decent refractor and a good mount is that it might not even be valued, and then it's sad to have something $300+ ending up in the basement. At a sub-$200 price tag the options just get a bit limited.

The AWB is not ideal, of course not. But it can be great for camping and such, and a kid can take it along (to a friend overnight, to grandma etc.) without much trouble, compared to a bulky mount. It is just one option.

I've never observed on a roof, so I can't really judge that :-)

Hey, it's a discussion forum for a reason :-)

Cheers!Hello,

no rush :-)

If you can not see the milky way planets are your best bet, probably.

I don't know where you can find darker spots in your area, but it's always worth to get away from town/city lights a bit; I live in a city with over 200 000 citizens and just a mile away conditions are noticeably different (though the milky way is still faint).

The Skywatcher 130650 on EQ2 is like the Heritage 130p I talked about, but on a Equatorial mount. It's stability is not good (even for this short turbe), but it's somewhat tollerable. Do not extend the tripod fully and prepare to have a lot of vibration when focusing/tracking, which can be really anoying.

The 90mm computerized telescope is a neat toy. It will show a lot, but 90mm can be a bit limiting for deep-sky. Maximum magnification for planets is around 180x.

I am a bit confused, aren't those over your budget of 2000 pesos?

Would you mind building a simple mount? Then a used 114/900 will be right in your budget. These come on weak mounts, mediocre eyepieces, thus they often sell cheap used.

Something like [this](http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-578588431-telescopio-galileo-italy-900-x-114-ii-eq-_JM). The EQ1 is too weak to really support the long tube, so a DIY mount is in order.

Could not find any used dobsonian other than http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-583023925-telescopio-reflector-casero-buscador-laser-dobsoniano-_JM - seems like a DIY telescope. Decent if it's in good conditions, 4" is a bit smaller than the 130/650 but the longer focal length will make it decent for planets.I do not know that specific one, from a Zoom spotting scope I heard people had to test 5 or 6 to get a good one, so YMMV.

Perhaps ask if you can try the next in-store. Else consider something more "astronomy suited". 

Where are you from?

In Europe some of the cheaper TS and Bresser binoculars are fairly decent and affordable. But even for those, buy where returning isn't a hassle.What telescope is it? 127/1000? There's usually a label on it.

Cleaning-&gt; Did you clean the glass/mirror surfaces? If so, how? This can make things worse if you cause micro scratches :-)  Random guide: http://www.televue.com/engine/TV3b_page.asp?id=103

You should be able to see cloud band on Jupiter. Let's assume your telescope has 1000mm focal length.

 - 1000/6.5mm eyepiece =~154x  

 - 1000/25mm eyepiece=40x &lt;- Start with this one, focus, center, switch to 6.5mm, focus

 - 2X Barlow: Doubles the magnification. But the plastic barlow is not good and lowers the contrast.


At 150x magnification you should see at least the two center cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn's rings (if it's up at night again) and possibly even the cassini division. 

IF the telescope is a catadiopter/bird-jones (additional lens in the focuser artificially extending the focal length of a flawed short mirror, causing contrast/collimation issues), make sure if it's collimated and else check back here as collimation for bird-jones telescopes is a bit tricky; do a star test (use a high magnification, unfocus a bit, check if the star appears in the center, see [random graphic on random site](http://www.willbell.com/tm/tm5.htm)).

The focusing issues can be caused buy the bird-jones system not being aligned perfectly, as the Pl\u00f6ssl should not bee too bad.

Buying other eyepieces can help, but use what you have now. A 6.5mm Pl\u00f6ssl has a short eye relief, and more modern eyepieces have a larger apparent field of view.  

.


[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622) are links on what to expect in different aperture,  so you know what to expect.

Venus will show it's phases, but not really detail in telescopes. Jupiter, Saturn and Mars (on a good night) are the only one showing more then a small dot with color... But only if the atmospheric seeing is good. Also you might need to observe a few minutes.


.

Eyepieces: Depends on your focal length and your targets. Corvus Optics has cheap Pl\u00f6ssl ($17-$22.50, but under 10mm the eye relief gets too short), a decent $22 Barlow (but dedicated eyepiece work better), and the "gold line" 66\u00b0 for $35 ($24-$29 if you order at Dhgate or Aliexpress).

Do not buy eyepiece sets. IMHO The 25mm will work well as overview eyepiece, the 6.5mm depends on your personal tollerance to short eye relief. If the mount holds a DSLR with tele lens all-right, it'll work for the C90 :-) I have a old camera tripod, I saw it for \u20ac20 recently, and even used the c90 on a more plasticy mount and it was alright. You can get quite usable ~$50 tripods. Also EQ1 or Celestron Az sells cheaply used (&lt;$50) as well, even under $100 new.

Don't they sell an equivalent to the SkyWatcher 90/900 AZ3 over there? They don't cost much more than the 60mm and 70mm refractors but offer a bit more aperture.

Tape a LDR sensor onto the light or put it into the light's case. :-)Too bad :-/ Yikes, never seen/heard of that before. That would be a F/3 telescope and unusual. //edit: The Model number tells me it is  a 150/750. Typo?

F/5 that would explain why only the center of the eyepieces are sharp. Good eyepieces for F/5  and under can cost more than that telescope. Even then they will show coma.

 It's not a catadiopter. F/5 requires a perfect parabolic mirror, else high magnifications will lack contrast, also if not collimated.


Gold line are OK. If the mirror quality is good, you can get a 3.2mm or 4mm HR Planetary 58 degree, $35-$40 at Aliexpress or (sometimes) Corvus optics; BST Explorer are other good ones like that available in this focal length range. Sadly the gold line are not available under 6mm unless you want to tinker, as you can change their effective focal length pretty easily.

.

Eeeeeeep! :-) Never clean a mirror like that! Hehe. Compared to house-hold mirrors they are front coated. Cleaning the thin aluminum coating with microfiber can cause micro scratches (rubbing particles over the delicate coating) and makes things much worse then dust ever could (has little effect). Glass cleaner... Well... I have no idea how the coating will react to that.

Anyway,Hello :-)

I use a prepaid ccard for Ali (and it takes 2-8 weeks to arrive, check seller ratings and shipping times), but you can find everything at Bang Good, eBay or even Amazon. 

There are a lot of great on-line tutorials and example projects. 

It's not as polished as Lego Mindstorms, but more flexible (and cheaper!).

 I'm currently building very simple 2wd robots with 7th&amp;8th grade (at a school I volunteer at) and it's a lot of fun, though none of the students have the background you have (Never done electronic projects, just signed up, because, hey, robots.) We use "Ardublock", which is kind of like the Lego Mindstorms programming, so it's fairly easy to get into, while the blocks represent the actual code rather well.

For the $500 or so you save, you could buy a 3D printer ;-) It's amazing what even the $200 printer can do. They  are a  great tool to make parts and get ideas made. But then, that kind of money buys you a nice set of tools for a  workbench, too.

Good luck with your projects and plans for the future!Hello :-)

Yes, binoculars are great tools, even in adition to a telescope.

It really depends on your budget and what you are trying to achieve :-)

Even some $35 binoculars can work well (Celestron Cometron 7x50, or Bresser 10x50, depends a bit on your light pollution and how comfortable you are with holding 10x magnification steadily - I'm not, it's the upper limit I'd reccomend without a tripod).

Here's a review ([1](http://www.space.com/26021-best-binoculars.html), [2](http://www.space.com/27866-celestron-cometron-7x50-binoculars-review.html)) of the cheap ones. You can easily spend $200 or more on *good* binoculars. Though perhaps someone in your family or some friends have some you can borrow. Even in the cheapest there's more visible then to the naked eye.

Before investing too much, you could check which ones you enjoy the most. Or just get those  ~$35 binocular to make first steps. They can still be fun as day-time binoculars you can just throw into your backpack without worrying too much on getting them dirty or dented. Or you (later) give them to an   nephew/niece/friend's kid that got interested into astronomy.

It's hard to make a decision before having used some; Perhaps you'll like 6x30 as they are light and small... or 8x50 as you live under dark skies and like to hold them free-handed comfortably; or 10x50 under not-so-dark skies as the exit pupil is smaller / the city sky background will not be as bright (lowering the contrast)... Or larger 15x70, 25x80 binoculars on a tripod for nebulae and star clusters with medium apparent size.

.

Books such as "Turn left at Orion" or "Simply stargazing" come to mind. TLAO is great for naked eye, binoculars and small to medium telescope. Not only showing you where to find objects, but also how to observe, what's worthwhile in the optics you own, and what to expect. Good all-rounder. But there are other books specific for binoculars as well.

A dim red light will preserve your night-vision much better than a cellphone with backlit display (night vision takes half an hour to reach it's peak, but under a second to destroy), but there are deep red transparencies (astronomy supplies, stage lighting, anaglyph sheets). Great apps, Night sky tools, Stellarium for example.

.

Of course you can start with a telescope. That's what I did, because I wanted to see the rings of Saturn. And I don't regret it.

But I also got cheap binoculars soon, as it does make things easier as beginner. If you can't locate an object in the small field of view of the telescope or finder, grab the binoculars, find it, and use nearby bright stars as guide.

Binoculars can show you the moons of Jupiter as a row of little "stars", the phases of Venus, and a bit of color in Mars. Binoculars are really great for larger nebulae and star clusters, for example the Plejads, the Andromeda galaxy, or the NGC7000 nebula. Most (smaller) deep-sky objects will appear as small, faint fuzzies, either round or oval (e.g. the Galaxies 81 and 82 next to each other, one round, one long-ish). But some things like planetary detail or small, faint structures are only visible in telescopes.

100-$200 will buy you a nice &amp; portable (small to medium) telescope, e.g. AWB Onesky/Heritage 130p (nice for wide-field, good portability, 130mm already shows quite a lot), Celestron c90 (super portable, also good for day-time use as the image is up-right, just use a rigid camera tripod), but most sets have a few down-sides, especially those on an equatorial mount &amp; tripod (The EQ1 or even EQ2 mount in most sets in this price range are not very stable, the Meade Polaris 130eq or Celestron astromaster 130eq are still tollerable). There are also some nice small refractors in this price range, but the mount stability is always the weak spot. Also table top telescopes like the SkyScanner 100 for under $100, or a (used) 114/900 reflector (&lt;$50 used, &lt;$100 new on a weak mount) if you are comfortable with building a simple rockerbox mount.

$350-$400 will buy you a 8" dobsonian; Largest aperture for your money, capable of showing you things under dark skies none of the smaller ones really can. The spiral structure of some galaxies becomes visible. Even from a light polluted city the 8" is great for planets, star clusters and such. See https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622

You can also get a computerized GoTo telescope at this price point, but with a good book/map finding things is not hard and fun. With a GoTo telescope, most money goes into the electronics and (at this price point) mediocre mount, instead of the actual optics.

.

Whatever you choose, have fun with this fascinating hobby :-) Clear skies!The problem is that while reducers might reduce the focal length and thus the magnification with your existing eyepieces, you may get vignetting. I tried a 20mm eyepiece on my smaller telescope and it did not really show all that more than a 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl.

Secondary, focuser &amp; field-stop can be limiting factors.

Is this for you POWERSEEKER 114EQ?

You could also try to get a used 130/650, they don't cost much, or the sub-$100 114/400 if you want a larger field of view. There are some sub-$30 reducers, but they aren't too great. I see Aliexpress has reducers from $6 that look similar, for that kind of money, worth a try to see if it works at all.

As I am not home atm I can not try my reducer on my 125/900 (closest I have to the 114EQ) right now.For lunar observing cheap sun-glasses suffice, as the poor UV blocking cheapo sunglasses are no issue :-) Unless you easily get moon burn...

Teleskop-Express has a filter that changes polarization and color, though I have not tried it myself, it seems intriguing. http://www.teleskop-express.de/shop/product_info.php/language/en/info/p316_TS-Multi-Color-Filter---Variabler-Polarisationsfilter---1-25-.html - I just don't use filters that much to justify the purchase.

When you get a Telrad you will need Telrad maps, there are free printable ones though, and/or you can print telrad circles in the scale of your existing maps on a inkjet/laser printer transparency sheet.

A telrad only makes sense if the light pollution is low -&gt; So you can see enough stars to align the telrad circles. Else a (right angle!) 8x50 finder scope is a nice tool.Hi :-)

The list sound good :-) Telrad depends on your observing conditions, as posted in the other reply. 

The Delta seems like a good offer. The GSO Deluxe I was referring to  are very similar regarding the included accessories, just different in color. I think I posted a link to it in one of my initial replies. But just buy the one cheaper (/w shipping) if the shop has a good reputation.

Eyepieces &amp; Eye relief

the 30mm and so will have enough eye relief for glasses, not sure about the 15mm. Under 1mm exit pupil (at F/6, 6mm eyepiece) you can probably observe without glasses as the small exit pupil works beneficial, the astigmatism  won't play a role then :-)

Even if you choose different eyepieces later on, the gold line will have a relatively good resale value. They are of course not perfect, but at 22-50\u20ac they are one of the best choices in this price range, at least when you want a large field of view.


.

Regarding binoculars:

 Check if you can find some / buy some from friends, family, flea-market. 

They don't even have to be all that great. Even something like these [10\u20ac](http://www.amazon.de/D%C3%B6rr-Pro-Lux-Fernglas-21mm-schwarz/dp/B000L9SKDE/ref=sr_1_1?s=ce-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445786982&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fernglas+8x) binocular are better than none! :-) Also 8x is easier to hold free-handed.

2.6mm exit pupil is pretty small but for some nebula it's fine. 

If you have a dark sky,  astromarket also has the Cometron 7x50. Decent for it's low-budget price tag. Easier to hold free-handed.

When buying binoculars you might want to check if you can get them locally or somewhere where returning is no hassle, as some cheap ones can be mis-aligned or have other problems.

.

Budget

Those accessories add up quickly, don't they? :-) A complete set costs at least as much as the 10" ;-) But then you would not have anything but the basic eyepieces...

If your purchase is over budget, you can get the Telrad later. The 8x50 finder scope will do fine for starters, but for deep-sky, I value the Telrad (or Rigel).


  Alternatively order the gold line in China or from Germany, this way you will save 35\u20ac-40\u20ac or so. But I suppose it's not too much of a saving.

.

Red light: 

For my mother,  I used  a [$1 bike light](http://www.ebay.de/itm/1x-5-LED-Flashing-Lamp-Red-Light-Rear-Cycling-Bicycle-Bike-Tail-Night-Safety-/371463723600?hash=item567cf69a50:g:ZTwAAOSw5VFWHedy) and added a few layers of tape inside to dim it down, works well. Most others will be too bright and taping something over them does not look as neat. Adjustable ones are a bit more expensive but useful. 

You can also get Head lamps like [this](http://www.ebay.de/itm/Flashlight-500LM-Mini-3x-CREE-R3-2-Red-LED-Headlight-Headlamp-Head-Torch-Lamp-/381149329320?hash=item58be4537a8:m:moXK7vK51kXqddvQpAuFc8g) for 4\u20ac-6\u20ac but it's always a problem if they have bright white LED, most seem to cycle through the LEDs, so it's impossible to just turn red on and off unless you destroy the white LED or the wiring. Hands-free reading is nice.

If you have some RED LED laying around anyway, just get a poti with a knob and wire something together with a resistor and a 9v battery, put it in a small plastic box, and you're all set :-)

.

Other stuff:

- Look for a chair like [these](http://www.amazon.de/Leifheit-71325-Multisitz-Niveau-chrom/dp/B000VJE5SI/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445788324&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=b%C3%BCgelhilfe), Aldi/Lidl have them on sale here or you can get them at flea markets for under 20\u20ac.

- Telrad maps for printing, PDF from  [avila.star-shine.ch](http://avila.star-shine.ch/download/telradkarten.pdf)Yeah, but depending on your chair and observing height it's not too bad. But yes, I wonder why the Right angle finders aren't standard :( Some telescope sets do have them.Hi! 

A 90/1000 refractor is a nice tool. Of course it's aperture is the bottle-neck when it comes to deep-sky, but most of the Messier list should be well visible if the conditions allow it. Many beginners had a smaller aperture to start with! :-)

You should be able to see quite  a few nice things, such as the Galaxy M81/M82, M51 should reveal both of it's cores... A colliding spectacle in the night sky, much like our Galaxy and Andromeda may  *soon* look like from afar.

Do you have something like "Turn left at Orion"? The targets listed are perfect for 90mm aperture.

If you feel aperture fever, a larger reflector/dobsonian will probably be on your wish list soon enough... But that first telescope is always something special :-)

Clear skies!Hi, there's a PDF version of TLAO as well, but I reccomend purchasing the paper version :-)

Yes, there are a lot of great Apps (also Stellarium, Night sky tools). Depending on your phone's display technology, the  back-lit ones (non-oled)  can influence your night-vision even in red/night mode. There are deep red transparencies available that eliminate any risk and dim the screen down a bit more, too. 

Tracking always means: More expensive, leaving less money for the optics. A larger dobsonian and a EQ Platform would be an affordable solution ($300 new, or &lt;$100 DIY), or the (SkyWatcher) GoTo-Dobsonians. 

Yeah, used offers never pop up when you're looking for something :-) But they can save a lot of money. Also check out /r/telescopedeals and Cloudynights, as well as local astronomy societies :-)Usually amateur astronomers are a friendly crowd and happy to talk about the subject &amp; even show you some of their telescopes. 

Though remember: 3 telescope owners, 4 different oppinions ;-)Hello, as /u/yawg6669 wrote: Nope :-) On both. Sorry.

You can pick up either of these for under $40 used (A similar reflector was my first telescope, payed ~$20). The mounts are not good, the finder and eyepieces are the cheapest possible. 

I'd say the reflector is a bit better (Aperture size, mount, ... but the version with motor focuser unnecessary).

Of course you can observe with the telescopes, but they will cause some frustration. Sadly the larger 100-135mm aperture reflectors cost much more.

I was going to recommend astro binoculars, but I don't know that brand, fearing they are cheaply made.

Perhaps you can find something else, or trade/sell the coupon to a friend/family member. If you want to get started with telescopes, this store is not where I'd start. The 4.5" reflector cost $200 up, over double compared to the (also weak mount) common 114/900 EQ1 sets. If you can get one for ~&lt;$50 used and you're willing to make a simple rockerbox mount, that would be a great budget entry.
 


Hi :-) I was tempted to recommend those too; Any clue if they are OK?

//edit: Found one Amazon Review, but that's it.Oh just great. Now robots are smarter than me. 


Next time I cornered myself with the mop, I'll hop on that robot to return to safety. :-)Older models such as the Canon 300D did not have live view; Cameras such as 450d did not have video recording. They all have bulb mode and remote shutter (some newer ones even via wifi/phone, otherwise $1 remote off ebay).

Live view basically just shows what you otherwise see through the view finder, so you can focus and locate/center objects. All modern DSLR have it. Yes, it will simulate ISO/shutter speed to some degree.

If you are on a budget, you can pick up a used one. Sometimes even with modified IR Filter &amp; clip on so you can still use it during the day.

Even a 1200d (260\u20ac body, 320\u20ac kit) or whatever the entry level DSLR would work though. The main differences are the video mode, auto focus and so on.

Something like the 450d can be picked up for way under 100\u20ac (body only) sometimes. It's not as sensitive as some newer models, but I have one, and it's still a neat little camera :-)

.
 
You own a 5" Mak, Nexstar SLT right?

The mak is not ideal for imaging ("slow" aperture ratio -&gt; long exposures required; Small fov; And for planets, some planet/webcams work better than a DSLR as the planet will only appear tiny on the large chip).

The mount is not ideal for imaging (alt az instead of equatorial). You could take some shorter exposures &lt;30s, possibly without telescope (just the  camera + lens + mount). Possibly even construct a wedge or retract one leg, I've read about people having some success with that (but not with the heavy 5").

What are your imaging targets? Overall, the 127 SLT is indeed nice for snap-shots, I did not mean to rain on your parade. This, and just to make sure, beginners often want to see stars, as they have seen them on pictures (glowing orbs with texture and so on), but they are so far away that stars will remain dots even in the largest telescopes (with a [few exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Betelgeuse_VLT.jpg))

Aperture is key,

Rumor $200?Hello :-)
.

Mount 

Well, it has a mount, the dobsonian mount ;-) It's so popular because it's stable and cheap, while most equatorial mounted telescope sets have stability issues. A rigid EQ mount can easily cost more than the telescope itself, thus the weak bundles. Or they bundle very short bad cheap telescopes to reduce the strain on the mount.

.

130 650 on EQ2

I've had the Heritage 130 on a Astro3 (a tad more stable than the EQ2). Vibration is quite noticable ([1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//Astro3h130p450p10xLiveViewHit.gif), [2](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//astro3h130p450dSchwenk2zoom.gif)) but can be tolerated.

Note: Don't confuse with the short tube 114/1000 or 127/1000 which have some flaws (bird-jones, often have collimation/contrast issues)

.

114/900 on EQ1 ...and the DIY solution

These sell rather cheap.  Vibration/Mount video footage: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlcSC7IQB0) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV92ncjF5-Q) [3](https://youtu.be/_R5_tAaI1G0)]

May not seem like a big deal, but every time you focus or move it, it'll need seconds to fully calm down, making tracking and focusing tedious.

While not extending the tripod legs fully works for the 130650eq2, the eq1 is just not made for larger telescopes. 


You can get the 114/900 very cheap used as people get frustrated because of the weak mount, lack of stargazing instructions, and mediocre eyepieces. Building a simple rockerbox can get you a great entry level telescope at a fragment of the price;  [1](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6//rockerbox_einfach.jpg) [2](http://www.ringohr.de/tmp6/simplesimplemount.jpg) [3](https://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/how-to-build-a-dobsonian-mount-for-a-5-inch-telescope/)

.

Brands

It's difficult to recommend a brand over another; Celestron, Sky-Watcher, Orion, Meade,... All have good and terrible telescopes :-) Some smaller brands are well known for their mostly bad sets though. So just don't rush the purchase, and rather ask here than relying on some in-store reviews.

Dobsonians 6" and up are typically of similar quality. Partly because there are only two big companies manufacturing those cheap telescope mirrors. The accessories vary greatly though.

.

Import


Importing can be an option, but better check how high custom/duty fees are (either asking at the customs office, on-line, or a (local) astronomers club/forum, they surely have experience).

.

Buying

Do you know any other telescope on-line shops over there?

8000$ seems to be common for the 8" dobsonian (cost about the same over here in Europe), so you might find a used one for under 6000$, or a 6" for even less. A 8" will show you a lot and does not get boring for years to come (though with almost all sets you'll need one or two additional eyepieces to get the most out of it).

The GSO and Skywatcher 6" (150p) typically has a 2-inch focuser (allowing for eyepieces that show a larger overview), some other manufacturers only include those in 8" and up.

Zhumell, Saxon, GSO, Skywatcher, Orion, Meade, Apertura... All these make dobsonians, and probably many more (re)brands.

.


But...

...small telescopes can still be a lot of fun, are more portable, and don't drain your bank account so quickly :-) A Heritage100p/Skyscanner100/National geographic114-500 Table top can be fun, a Celestron c90 makes a superb travel and day time spotting scope, the Heritage 130p is the largest somewhat portable scope, over 5" it gets quite bulky. Still, I use my 5" the most ;-)  Though while most objects are faint fuzzies in 5", they really can show quite some detail in 8" (under good conditions).

.

Also, binoculars. 

Even some cheap ones - Bresser 10x50, Celestron Cometron 7x50, or some other &lt;~$50usd entry level binoculars with less than 10x magnification (to easily hold free-handed) show a lot and make it easier to get orientated in the beginning.

Clear skies!Hello,

thank you for your quick response :-)

I've seen that page in the documentation, but I don't quite understand how to implement/call the focus functions. I've managed to return some info (e.g. isFocusable()), but nothing with the  CaptureDeviceControls.

My code so far is basically the mentioned demo ([original source](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2012/04/10/directshow-for-processing/)).  
 

Could you perhaps point me in the right direction?  I apologize for my lack of understanding :-) I have not worked with anything but  the *standard* webcam library so far, and never used direct show functions.I don't know that one, but Turn left at Orion is very good for getting started. There's a PDF download, but buying the paper version has benefits.I've seen the getControls(), but I do not comprehend how.Hello :-)

1. Still beautiful. Not colorful though, as our eye's rod/cone cells have different low-light sensitivity.

2. Next time you see a big moon, hold your index finger over it at arm's length. Next time you see a smaller moon, hold your index finger over it at arm's length. You will notice it's apparent size is actually always around 0.5\u00b0, so your finger is twice as thick at arm's length :-)

The reason why it appears so huge is mostly because of the reference points. If it's appearing close to buildings or other things, our brain will interpret it as huge due to the reference points and the parallax. 

 - [Moon illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion)

 - Most graphics of the elliptical orbits of moon or earth are very exaggerated. So the distance does not really vary that much. If you'd draw the orbit (in scale) of the earth on a sheet of printer paper with a pencil, the minimum and maximum distance would lie within the thickness of the pencil stroke. 

.

 Fun fact: The Andromeda galaxy appears larger than the full moon! But due to civilization's light pollution, it's typically not visible to the naked eye as it's so faint and drowns in the sky glow.


Hello,

could you specific what kind of images, perhaps with samples?

Stars other than our sun will remain dots, even in the largest telescopes ([with a few exceptions](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Suche/Betageuze)).

The simmering fireballs you see in the media are typically artwork/CGI.

If you want to take images of constellations and larger star clusters, you just need a tripod and a camera that's capable of doing long exposures. While some compact cameras and bridge cameras offer this functionality, a DSLR (or system camera) will be well suited for this task. They usually have a larger sensor and you can change the lens.

If you want to take images of small &amp; globular star clusters, double stars and so on, you will need higher magnification, and as for most deep-sky objects, a equatorial tracking mount. While brighter objects can be captured without tracking (e.g. double star Albireo can even be captured with a smartphone through a manual telescope's eyepiece) everything else will require tracking. Something like the Celestron Nexstar SLT 127 can work for short exposures, but for serious imaging, a NEQ3/CG4/Astroview mount (or similar) plus motor is the minium you'd need. And either a good camera lens or a (small) telescope.

If you do not want diffraction spikes when imaging stars, a refractor is the way to go. If you want to capture deep-sky images without spending a fortune, a cheap reflector is the way to go. Both have ups and downs and it depends on what you are trying to achieve.Yikes. Not sure if any other shops offer lower shipping (Astroshop, though my customer service experience wasn't too good).

Shop around, ask for bundle deals, or cut the price of the eyepieces by ordering them somewhere else.I've played around with it, but I am simply not experienced enough to make sense of the documentation without more samples, sorry.

The documentation's CaptureDeviceControls is exactly what I am looking for, but the sample only adresses DSFiltergraph, I have no problem checking things like  gotFocus, but I have no idea how to call captureDeviceCcontrolls, where to implement it in the sample, and how to control the camera. 

I was hoping someone had similar problems to control a camera and either used this, another library, or can make sense of this.

I was hoping for something such as capture.setFocus, disable auto focus &amp; exposure control. E.g., a code snipped for IAMCameraControl I stumbled across earlier,     Set(CameraControlProperty.Focus, 250, CameraControlFlags.Manual);

Hello,

the humongous moon pictures are typically taken when the front object is further away, so it's apparent size is closer to the apparent size of the moon. If the tree would be three yard/three meters infront of you, the moon would most likely look like a fruit in the tree. To get them the same size you'd capture it when the tree is half a mile away or so.

Find something further away in the room you are, e.g. the doorknob, or a picture on the wall.  hold your index-finger and thumb in-front of your eye, so that it looks like you are a giant grabbing the door-knob/picture. You'll see that if you move your hand further away, your fingers appear to get smaller quickly. Same would apply if you want to take a image of someone holding the moon in his/her hands; Imaged from close-up, they could hold the moon between their thumb and index-finger; A few steps away they could hold it in both hands; Even further away, they would be as tall as the moon.




Eyecandy, if you haven't seen these around: http://pics-about.space/moon-photography-creative?p=1 

Also, [this](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/moon_.png). (Can you tell that I'm sick, bored, and have no mouse or digitizer for my laptop with me? :-) )

//edit: Also [this balloon/pumpkin version](http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/moon_b.png) as the moon/infinity thing might be too confusing as I did not draw the moon as large as it should have been due to obvious reasons (=screen too small).This! :-) Also, what is connected to the Arduino?

Also the 5v boosters for $0.30-$0.70 can be great for low current tasks.Hi :-)

Depends on what you are trying to power, as these modules can only supply a limited current; I blew up the regulator on two already.

A simple 5v USB wallwart will do. 0,5A, better 1A or 2A. But then you could power your breadboard directly (sans the 3.3v supply other than the one on the UNO, which can not supply much current).


The module is rated to 700mA or so, and I wouldn't push it. Especially when running it with a 9-12v power supply, the simple voltage regulator will turn most energy into heat. 

If you insist on getting a power supply, something like the common 1A 1.5A supplies will do, perhaps you still have one laying around (printer or laptop power supply as long as it's &lt;12v).

If you want to get fancy, get a regulated lab supply. Then you can (depending on the supply) get anything from 0-30v 0-5A without the need of the tiny SMD voltage regulator on that board.
Else it does not really matter if you get a $1 USB power supply or a $10 12v supply.

what eyepieces do you have? Kit eyepieces? Pl\u00f6ssl?

What barlow? Cheap ones show a lot of chromatic aberration.

What 6" dobsonian, does it have a 2" focuser? -&gt; 2" wide angle overview eyepiece

If the 10mm is a Pl\u00f6ssl or kit eyepiece (Kellner, Huygens...) a 6mm gold line eyepiece would perform much better than the 10mm+Barlow for planets. Both regarding contrast and field of view, making tracking easier.


Overview eyepiece 

 - http://picpaste.com/3fieldEyepieceTelradStarhoppingComaETC-DOUdil9E.jpg

6mm vs 6mm wide-angle

 - picpaste.com/fieldofview6mm66-taFA8uNA.png (also typically better eye relief)


You don't need a lot of eyepieces to have a lot of fun :-) 

 - Overview: A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl on 1.25" focuser, though the 25mm kit eyepiece is okey. On a 2" focuser you can get a 36-46mm 70\u00b0 wide angle eyepiece. They cost a bit more but show a lot.

 - For many deep-sky objects, 16-24mm is ideal (regarding exit pupil). A 15mm gold-line would be nicer as the existing kit eyepieces.

 - 6mm: 200x for planets and small DSO, more magnification is not always possible due to atmospheric seeing conditions anyway.


"Gold line": $24-$30 at dhgate or Aliexpress (Chinese seller portals), $35 at corvus optics http://corvus-optics.com/product/ultrawide-eyepieces/Hello,

there's no need for a 2" adapter (if you find any) as the focuser barrel limits the field of view, and the dobsonian typically does not have enough backfocus. A 32mm Pl\u00f6ssl or 24mm wide-angle eyepiece will show you the largest field of view possible.

Indeed, some find the shorter gold-line has kidney beaning, I find it  not being a problem. But I have not tried multiple if it varies or if it's equal with all of them.  The 15mm is better though.

 

There's also the HR Planetary and BST Explorer, they offer a smaller apparent field of view (still larger than the other eyepieces).

There are also various Erfle-type (typically the 70\u00b0 eyepieces) that aren't too expensive either.

If you like the 25mm you will enjoy some wide-angle eyepieces in the low/medium magnification range. Especially for DSO :-)

.

Personally I don't find gaps too big of a deal, especially at low magnifications. I don't need close eyepieces for (e.g.) 20x, 30x, 40x. Jumping from 25x to 50x is not as big of a deal compared to not having a few high power eyepieces to adjust to the seeing conditions and targets.

If you set up your eyepieces in Stellarium or similar you'll notice that 10x magnification more or less does not really matter too much.

For deep-sky, exit pupil and conditions are more crucial factors. A good eyepiece in the 2-3mm exit pupil range and something around 1mm can be very, very useful. More magnification will just make things dimmer.

(Exit pupil, the diameter of the light beam exiting your eyepiece, equals eyepiece focal length divided by telescope's aperture ratio)

So e.g. 32mm wide angle, 15mm wa, (9mm), 6mm wa would be a nice palette, but again, that's my personal opinion :-)  Also as you have some basic eyepieces, you can still use those.

The suggested palette is easy on the budget, too.
You could also get a 
32mm Pl\u00f6ssl, 24mm wide-angle, 16mm, 12mm, 8mm, 6mm, 5mm, 4mm... But that gets expensive quickly and is redundant.  

Or the Astrozoom (that, unlike other zooms, does not get a smaller apparent field of view on one side of the setting). 

Great! :-)

I don't know, I think they have flat charges over a certain order value/weight. And again, you can get those other eyepieces cheaper, shipped - if all fails :-)

Yes, eyecap is enough. In fact, you could even do it without, but it's not as accurate. The cheshire's crosshair (and often sight-tube combo) is just a great and simple tool (sometimes avl. for $20).
The only problem is that the dobsonians are so long :-) If you are alone, you will have to move back and forth from focuser to collimation screws... One reason why laser collimators are so popular. Though the cheap ones are often not good (laser not pointing straight).  In germany, this is the one to get: http://drehen-und-mehr.beepworld.de/45g2zoll.htm But ~\u20ac80 is pretty steep and you can do it with the \u20ac4 cap and star test. Also the dobsonian holds collimation well enough, so while you need to check it regularly, it's often fine (star test to fine tweak...).

The thing is, small things ship pretty inexpensively. No clue why some of the shops have so enormous shipping cost. (UK and German eyepiece sources have something around \u20ac5 shipping, the Chinese sellers offer "free" shipping as it's even cheaper for small goods there).

Dobsonian + 6 and 15mm Eyepieces + Collimation cap + Map + Telrad (+ filter) is pretty much what you'll need for many nights to come. You may find yourself wanting another eyepieces or two in the future, but IMHO there is no need to get those now, as you can not be sure what you'll like in the future (Another medium-low magnification, or a bit more for planets when the Seeing allows... Or just better ultra wide angle eyepieces... Or the AstroZoom set that turns the gold line into a neat zoom...)

Yeah, electronic parts are the main reason I'm using Aliexpress as well :-)
