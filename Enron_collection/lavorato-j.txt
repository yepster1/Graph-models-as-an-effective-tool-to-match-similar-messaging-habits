 This person seems confused.  Please advise. 
 Enjoy 
 The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree. Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.   *  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:  2001 - $5.06 2002 - $4.96 2003 - $4.86 2004 - $4.75 2005 - $4.65  *  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power.  *  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.  *  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.  *  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.  *  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five. 
 Sarah I trust you.  Just tell her what we need. 
 Can you get me his undergrad grades. 
 I didn't think that you ever officially reported to me.  Let me know.  I didn't think I needed to do your review. 
 Yes  6437 Mercer St. Houston Tx 77005  P.S.  I hate golf. 
 The two cheap guys -  Tycholiz and Lavorato  Change Milnthorp to Calger. 
 I have a meeting tomorrow.  Can you tell me what total power demand in in the East and the West and what Enron's volumes are. 
 Sticking to Motocross eh.

 don't you love the ok method of communicating. 
 Can we do it without the bonus target. 
 Hickerson always claims that they have var by trader. 
 As requested. 
 Kevin  I know its tough but your groups need to be involved in recruiting as much as possible to keep uplifting the talent in your group. 
 I'm sorry but I think its my only child syndrome. 
 Apparently not eh. 
 What if they have there current postions but bigger getting them to their limits.  What would the agg var be. 
 Sounds great. 
 We should get 9 Million of Prudency tonight. 
 Bob  I talked to Kevin about these two guys and he feels they are critical to our business.  Broadband has taken 5 guys out of East Power and left us short.  Sorry 
 I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects (I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects (ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives and timeframe.  Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.  John 
 Can't seem to find this.  John 
 no interest 
 I think everybody is scared of us. 
 No problem bensen 
 Book the  Cenral Trasport Deals and give me a report every month.  The new format looks fine.  John 
 Thanks I'll take care of it. 
 Kevin Presto is on it. 
 John  I'm out of town at a wedding that weekend but thanks for the invite. 
 I think he reports to Jeff Shankman.  I forwarded you e-mail to Jeff.  Let me know. 
 Ted  Call me.  I told Charlene that I would do a super saturday and be a moderator for the decision process.  I forgot which one.  Helllllpppp. 
 Kim  Please print all these resumes for me. 
 6437 Mercer St  In West University.  2 1/2 blocks from University Avevue between University Avenue and Holcombe.  713-661-6096. 
 Correction I never suggested this. 
 Set  me up on this. 
 So I'm working some magic for Friday.  I think we are going to play a private men only club for free (except for caddie fees).  I figure the downside is that we get pummled and left for dead.  I'll let you know. 
 This crazy.  Sooner or later they will win.  We need to do something radical to make them realize they are insane.  I don't know what that is. 
 Call me on this I am a little confused. 
 I would be happy to do a phone interview with this guy.  But I won't pay for him to fly down. 
 James might have a chance in putt-putt. 
 Every golf course in Houston has a golf tournament next friday.  What do you think about mini-putt. 
 Print all these resumes for me. 
 Saturday 10 my course.  Sunday 8 Tour 18.  Friday - Working you. 
 yes 
 I do not run EES trading.  I would contact Marty Sunde with respect to big costs that EES wants to spend.  Marty runs EES North America.  I agree with you however that they should't go crazy on spending. 
 I'm okay with this. 
 If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles" she would be in heaven.  We got a crazy cold spell last week but it should be gone when you come.  In case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be fine. 
 This is what I mean aout miscommunication. 
 I'm sensing that you don't have much to do during the day.  I'm thinking about inviting Mark Waldren down at the same time.  Please advise. 
 I thought you hated getting involved.  Just kidding. Congrats.  Lavo 
 Bill  Scott Neal talked to someone who said that we could do this. Please call Scott. 
 Anthony  Thanks for the email, however, that was the last thing that I received.  I think some credit intermediation would be helpful. 
 I guess we will just go without a contract. 
 I hope you are talking to Phillip to get you system needs as part of this project. 
 I not sure I know who David Jallits is, 
 Liz,  Let me know when they send out the web address and I will make sure that John fills out the forms.  k 
 Charlene  Just a comment.  I would love to facilitate a couple decision meetings when I'm in town. 
 I guess I'll let this one slip through.  Lavo 
 I know that you'll give me hell for this but I'm out of town for my Sister-in-Law's wedding that weekend.  John. 
 Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas. Please advise. 
 Beth  Can you get me an updated list of projects by October 9th. 
 Vince where did this resume come from and is he still employed by the National Bank in Monteal. 
 Did you get me the performance review forms. 
 I having second thoughts about raising South American limits.  If its not too late and if I have a vote give me a call. 
 Greg  Thanks for taking the time to interview Nigel.  If you like him please sell him hard on 
 Kim  Have you called Nigel and told him about the interviews. 
 Just wondering if I am going to take the same fate as Keith. 
 Get on my schedule. 
 Colleen  I have no idea what my intent is.  I was trying to get more info so that I could evaulate things.  This may mean that I do nothing from a valuation perspective. 
 Yes Call me. 
 I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% of reviews done.  Do you agree. 
 Wes  Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I wonder if some of our other piplelines are members. 
 So I guess Dave doesn't want to send this out. 
 Hoyt  The Zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in Canada. They might need to change his Contract to Canadian language but none of the terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon Canadian $ pay. 
 noooooo!!!  Gas Var. Gas Var. Futures accounts. 
 David  I quess this whole Nelson Ferries contract thing started before me.  However, I can't imagine that we can retract on it.  Please advise. 
 You missed logistics as a rotaion.  Also - Let's leave out where they graduate to.  This might be an issue with the AA program if we say that they are going to re-enter the program. 
 You should include VP's and also you should make it a little clearer that I don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision. 
 We got it covered.  It was my fault. 
 Oxley  Change it to 150 and 100 on Long term comp and ignore the bonus target and send it back to me.  I will forward it to Belden with a note.   Thanks 
 Yes 
 Dave  I agree with all your points.  There had to be a first time. I've been blowing Ted off because of the markets last week. Let's get together this week with Ted and discuss the future.  Kim please set up meeting with Ox and Bland and me. 
 Tina,  In the future, if you have a message regarding John Lavorato's schedule, could you please send it to me instead of sending it to John.  Also, you did not provide the time, however, Kay Chapman indicated that the meeting will take place at 2:00 p.m.  John is not available at 2:00 p.m.  Thank you  Kim 
 I don't but I need a golf shirt.  Just kidding. 
 Hoyt   Did you get me response on Martin. 
 Can you send the contract to me.  I guess this one went out before me. 
 Tim  There is absolutely a spot for John.  Maybe he should give me a call or even come an see me.  Why don't you talk to him and also I would love your thoughts on what the best role for him would be. 
 Good job on this. 
 Get me info on this. 
 Talk to Fletch about progress. 
 Charlene  My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire. I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.  Regards  John 
 Fine  Do it quickly. 
 Rob  Can you make sure that the Toronto Office is not blowing their minds on costs. 
 Peter  Deal with Joe Deffner directly.  I threatened his life if we don't pay them in time. 
 Call me about this. 
 Rick Buy  I'm expecting more details from Bill re. Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about this.  I will deal with my traders when I have the details.  On the Retail side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale trading group in retail which is clearly happening.  This wouldn't of happened it they were trading through us. 
 Let me sit on that because Scott's performance has not been as strong as Hunter and Fletch's. 
 Becky,  Who instructed you to send out this form?  Kim    Enron North America Corp. 
 Please give Mike Grigsby access to the basis position reports and the fixed price position reports for gas. 
 Make sure the Benson's of the world who don't read their E-mails read this 
 That would be outsanding. 
 No to Nelson and I'm ok with Scott but I would like to hear the figures. 
 No changes 
 hi nana its micael 
 Mike  Can you live with the gas position reports.  John 
 Just say that I said that you did a great job.  Lavo 
 Eric the contact names are listed at the bottom of this message.  Please call if you have questions. 
 My opinion is that you need a budget.  Lavo 
 Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.  John 
 Can I please extend the 45 million var and the contracts in the power book until the Board meeting on October 11th. 
 I know you are screwing with me.  If you are not.  NO! 
 Can I also get a copy of his resume. 
 Rick  I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems perspective.  I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.  We simple do not have one.  From there I will coordinate with traders and back office to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.  My new motto is "Systems will be fixed or people will die".  I will keep you informed.  John 
 Was Greg onside with this stuff?  Give me a call. 
 Aslo where all my traders that I assigned. 
 Why is Milnthorp doing a U.S. school and I thought I was doing MIT 
 Beth  Get me that new list as soon a possible.  John 
 Dave  As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to get a sense of how many people we hire.  Might even need the number of hires and fires/resignations.  My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would be made. 
 Dave  I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per on the road working on it.  We probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless New Albany is enough. 
 Looks great.  I think we should have a least 1 or 2 real time traders in Calgary. 
 FYI - see below.  Belden is the King! 
 Fletch  Make sure they also set up the fixed price vs. daily term swaps at Henry the Hub. 
 Wes  Are we allocating people like research out to the various wholesale groups.  John 
 Good Job! 
 I'm in Vegas this weekend, want to come.  P.S.  We should play soon I have averaged 94 in my last 5 rounds. 
 I've told Presto to relax 17 times.  Just deal with me on this one. 
 The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial managers. 
 I keep hearing that Mcsherry is gone yet his xxxxxx name keeps coming up.  Lavo 
 Can I please see the resumes. 
 NGX owes us a lot of money on Deceber 25th.  Please send me an  email when we receive it.  Thanks  John 
 This e-mail is kind of funny. 
 Should the cap affect the marginal price of power in Ontario.  Lavo 
 I would like to see the resumes. 
 Looks good to me.  John Lavorato 
 I think I know what this E-mail is about. 
 Sorry Vince I have been out of town.  Please give me a call tomorrow. 
 That's fine by me. 
 Dave  Try to make sure that my assigned guys get significant roles.  Make sure they are interviewing on campus.  PS  Herdon is a director not VP 
 Help 
 Let's grab another 15 minutes together before you do anymore work,  John  Tuesday may work -  check with Kim Hilis. 
 I am writing to inform you that John Lavorato has left for vacation however should be checking emails throughout the next week.  If you believe this matter requires his immediate response, please call and let me know or leave John a voicemail.  Kim Hillis x30681 
 Change Holst and Grigsby to 35 Million and 35 Million. 
 Phillip Allen will put 50 Million in Schedule C reserve on August 23rd and Mike Grigsby and Kieth Holst will put 25 Million each on August 24th. 
 Paul  The fellow in Andea Reed's group is all yours.  P.S.  How is our trade coming along. 
 If this is OK with you its OK with me. 
 Given our current views of the natural gas markets, we are requesting an increase in our VAR limits from 40 million to 45 million until next Tuesday.  John 
 XXXX XXX 
 We won a PPA in Alberta.  We will know for sure on Thursday when the government declares the auctin a success or not.  It is highly like that it will be a success.  Please direct all detailed questions through Derek Davies in Canada (403-974-6793) 
 10 Million - Pan Nat gas purchase from Duke - Contract allows for price determination.  10 Million - Tolls Risk associated with PGT transport that expires in 2023.  10 Million  - Index Risk at Chicago as a result of the Peoples transaction  I'll call you later today. 
 I need trader performance by Var for everyone you have in the company  by 8:00 AM tommorrow morning. 
 Dave  We need to think about trying to get more VAR for the gas floor before all these other commodities go to the Board and scare the hell out of them.  I have several reasons for this so lets discuss.  Lavo 
 Get Chris Abel on my schedule early Monday. Also can you make sure that I have a computer set up for me in Portland and Calgary and that it gets me into my network.  I especially need to be able to get into the executive reports. 
 Beth  I'm wondering if you are done are close on the systems plan.  I am getting on a plane early monday afternoon.  I would love something to review even if it is not complete.  Thanks  John 
 Per  I misplaced your emain on the funds.  Can you resend it please.  Thanks John 
 OK  I think 3 days a year is fair. 
 Tim  Given the tight schedule, lets try to find a half and hour for me to sit in front of all of the traders at once.  John 
 Chris ask Dave he is still the king of your world in my mind. 
 A couple questions.  Do I need to do anything next Wednesday or will money just hit my accout?  Will you pay the contractor and if so why is Len Wong involved?  John 
 Jessica,  I have resent the information to you with the requested signatures.  Could you please provide me with the exact address so that I can send this overnight to your attention.  Thank you  Kim Hillis assistant to John Lavorato 713-853-0681 kimberly.hillis@enron.com 
 Send me stuff on Wolfe's performance this year and where you would rank him. I need this for tomorrow. 
 Can you please help Greg get this info.  I have to think that we have this info somewhere. 
 Dave  I hate to make the management committee too big but how about Scott Tholen. He is very high quality. 
 I really think we can do this more systematically.  Give me a little time. ie.  Trust me I'm the Godfather. 
 Mark  We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which is rare and all marketer deals.  If we do this we might consider keeping the tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.  Please advise. 
 I talked to Whalley about it a little bit.  The one issue is that when we liquidate a bad position they get out first.  Think about it. 
 Make sure we don't lose these two to Jeff.  Call Celeste and tell them that we have place them in gas. 
 What have you been smoking. 
 Thank you Donnie.  I was having server problems yesturday so you did the right thing!  Thanks again and have a wonderful day.  Kim

 Just to be clear.  There will be no re-allocations of analysts and associates from ENA to Global Products. 
 Veronica,  In the future, please send this information to me so that I can print it off and make sure that it gets signed.  Kim Hillis x30681 
 Dave  Is there a round 2 of raptor and is Beau Canada going into it. 
 That's great.  Please don't let Len delay. 
 We should be getting gas fax. 
 Does this mean that we have no VAR limit during this time. 
 Tim  If at all possible I would like us to pass on talking publicly about this topic.  John 
 Can you please print me 20 color copies of these reports just this week.  I want to distribute them to me head traders. 
 The PPA auction is going along well I think.  We are leading on Sundance B and have been for 3 rounds now.  Some weird things are occuring so it is too early to tell what will utimately happen.  The government has said that it will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.  We would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B. Currently we are bid  $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD. But again its too early to get our hopes up. 
 Rick  I would like to request an extension of the 45 million limit until Friday. We like gas and we would like to maximize this move. 
 Thanks for the increased VAR.  We got it right this time. 
 David  When you get back, hopefully in one peice.  Can you take care of my moving expenses and the gross up issue. 
 Please give me a call this week I need some info. 
 I can't seem to print this.  Can you try. 
 Hey Greg.  If you ever are in Houston again give me a call.  I want to talk to you about the order stuff in the second version of EOL. 
 Make sure this is on my schedule. 
 I haven't seen an e-mail. 
 Kevin  Is this the guy you are interviewing. 
 Can set up a conference call with me and Remi Cologne in Brazil this week. Also, what happen to Manu. 
 I think Shankman wants me to go to this.  If this is true please put it on my schedule. 
 Fine. 
 EES is trading them up.  Give me a call. 
 Thanks for the update and keep up the good work. 
 Please put the new hire thing at the doubletree on Monday on my schedule. 
 Andre,  I gave John the Round 5 information and told him the time restraints.  Please let me know if you need anything further.  Kim 
 Sorry  -  A hurricane off Africa - I think you will have a good tail wind when you are leaving.  Lavo 
 Brian  Sorry I didn't get back quickly.  You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate perspective.  In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of what they would try to do in the next little while. (ie how much one way exposure)  This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market. 
 So do we have emmisions. 
 Thomas,  Please do not email this to John.  I believe that I have been receiving a copy of this from Gabriel in the morning with the other gas information.  In the event that this is an update or different information, always direct it to my email address.  Thank you for all and call me if you have any questions.  Kim Hillis x30681    Enron Energy Services 
 Now that we sent the first blow, lets get everyone together to discuss our future steps.  Next week is a nighmare but perhaps you could set  up a conference call sometime Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered. 
 No storms in sight. 
 Looks good. 
 This looks good.  Don't worry I will definately call if I want something. 
 Natural Gas Risk Management requests and increase to 45 Million from 40 Million  to increase our gas fixed price position (long) until Tuesday morning (August 8th).  Thanks  John

 John  I asked about loss limits a couple months ago and Ted said that they no longer report these numbers to the board. However, I think we should get rid of the whole concept.  VAR is the relevant concept.  Please advise. 
 Ed  This stuff looks good.  Why don't you combine all your stuff, maybe include the org chart also and see if we can get a 3 or 4 page report.  Send it to me and I'll run if by Dave. 
 Please see the attached Alberta PPA presenation.  Please make review and if you have any modifications, please get with John as soon as possible.  Kim Hillis x30681

 Dave  What is the status:  Have they seen them.  If they haven't I would to talk to you about it. 
 I've been assured about funding before.  I would like to know what Canadian vehicle they are going to use. 
 Mario 
 You didn't attach anything. 
 I was right on the legal question Jeff asked.  Julia was wrong.  She is dropping a note to Skilling. 
 I think we should play on Wabamun - assume we are. 
 Tony  Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.  I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businesses.  What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down here! .... we need you!  John's callout quote  Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you. 
 Dave  Give me a call on the weekend if you get a chance.  I talked to Shankman and he talks about more groups going to Global than I thought.  Like to discuss.  Lavo  Home 713-61-6096 Cell 713-417-3074 
 Please order John an ISDN line with the understanding that he would still like to receive DSL.  Kim   Circuit Provisioning                07/21/2000 07:57 AM 
 Jeff  Please confirm that the assistants are going to the Houstonian to learn how to read the screens. 
 Where did you ever get the idea for this? 
 I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list of agreed apon tasks.  1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up.  -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure. (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority)  2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems.  3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk. TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the               traders to meet their needs.  -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.  4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.  5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements deals and volume management deals in the east.  6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).  7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with Houston.  -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in Portland.  -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering all his needs. 
 No hurry.  You guys just peeked my interest last time and I would like to continue discussions.  John 
 When we have made some inroads into SO2 analysis please set up another meeting with me. 
 It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of power in Ontario.  1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for Ontario.  2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.  3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have no power trading responsibilities.  4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.  5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know the people and the technical resources available to him.  If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.  John 
 Fifty dollars. 
 Ed  Set up a meeting with me and you to discuss this report. 
 Sorry Jim but I left you a voicemail saying that there was no material loss in trading. 
 Let's get this done quickly.  You should tell everyone what they need to do to accomplish this.  John. 
 Put this in my binder and tell him to start sending it to you. 
 Dave,  We had a meeting today with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, Greg Whalley, Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, Mark Haedicke, Julia Murray, Tim Belden, Elliot Mainzer, Derek Davies, Rob Milnthorp, and Peter Keohane regarding Alberta PPA.  Attached please find a copy of the presentation that was given at the meeting.  Call me so that we can discuss.     John 713-853-7991 
 I don't know why this is coming up now and why we don't address this at year end in conjunction with the PRC process. 
 Figure out how to print this file on one or two pages that is readable. 
 Ed  How are you doing on these reports. 
 Jeff  Why don't you take a stab at the disaster plan.  John 
 Rick  Can you include me on your distribution list re. Nepool and the ICAP product.  Thanks 
 OK 
 Jana,  Gas is Jeff Shankman and Kevin Presto is Power.  Get it contact with Jeff or Kevin to find out their information.  Call me or Ted Bland if you have any questions.  k     Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave  Can you get one of your people to handle this.  Lavo 
 I would love to see more detail. 
 Change the rating.  John Lavorato 
 I would like to request an additional 15 million var for gas.  Prices have exploded and I'm working on it. 
 I guess we were wrong.  We were totally surprised by the a.g.a. number.  We need to work on are ability to predict it.  Therefore, we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 40 Million limit.   I don't think there is any reason to change what we did today.  We will keep it in our pocket for 10 days unless you disagree.  John 
 Oxley and I will come up with a first stab at the option grants.  John 
 Put all these dates on my calander. 
 This is the most bizarre resume I've seen in a long time. 
 I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are eating up a lot of var.  Please advise. 
 Dave  It looks like we hit a home run. 
 Call me Lavo. 
 This is to confirm a meeting for tomorrow, Tuesday, July 11 at 2:00 pm. Please reference the meeting as Systems Meeting and also note that there will be a follow up meeting.   The meeting will be held in EB3321.  Call Kim Hillis at x30681 if you have any questions.  k 
 I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders that you think would benefit from it. 
 Tammy  Come and see me first thing.  The gas section is way long and complicated. 
 Dave  Following up on our summit.  I wrote down that you would follow up on the synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by Scott Tholen.   I would be happy to coordinate this myself.  Please write back and let me know if this is okay. 
 Ed  As well as Dave's suggestions, I would like to see value per transaction which I'm told you keep track of. 
 Brad  Can you get me a copy of the final PRC results for all employees in ENA. 
 Let me know if she doesn't solve your problems. 
 Beth  Please respond with a plan to solve these problems.  Thanks John 
 Kathryn  Although we are a qualified bidder, we still have not made the decision to bid.  I would try to avoid discussing but if you need to give me a call. 
 Joe  A couple of questions.  1.  Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.  2.  How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.  Talk to you soon.  John
