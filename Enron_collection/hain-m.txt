 In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the Commission rules. 
 By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..   See attached order. - EL00-95.1 
 Ron - Mary has asked that the document you reference be faxed to her in Houston (she is attending meetings there).  I will be out of the office Friday.  Would you please fax the document to her at:  281-364-6274.  This is the number for the Woodlands Resort.  The phone number, in case you need it, is 281-367-1100.  Thanks, Ron  Lysa Akin 503/464-7927    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 In case you haven't seen this. 
 Here are some FERC cases I'll probably be working on in the next month: (1) In Docket No. EL00-95-?, et al. the Cal ISO and EOB's Motion for Issuance of Refund Notice and (2) Cal PX Compliance filing and request for expedited Commission guidance in EL00-95-015.  Also I'll be assisting Gary Fergus and Richard Sanders with our discussion with the ISO about reporting cost of service information.  That's about as far ahead as I can see at the moment.

 I have looked on APS' OASIS for the substations you mentioned.  The only one listed as a receipt point was Moenkopi.  Below is a list of the other receipt points available.  I'll be out next week but if you need help looking to see if transmission capacity is available Diana, Paul, or Cara may be able to help you.

 As I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load, even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners uneconomically.  Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest.  If you could figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet.  However, I would wait to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests to APS'  transmission function given that the traders question whether APS may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function.  Depending on what APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you have to request transmission on-line.  I will help you do this when you're ready.  I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they have transmission for the project, but the cite was down.  I'll check again today. 
 On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale sales to date. 
 Anyone have any brilliant ideas on how we can produce this information?  In the meantime, Sue and I can prolong having to produce the information until we negotiate a confidentiality agreement. 
 The ISO is now saying that it has the authority to require EPMI to report our prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market Monitoring Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad authority to request information, specifically: "the submission of any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."  Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not order us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it. I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have asked Sue Mara if she would contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please advise if this is the proper course of action.  Please note, the information is due tomorrow.    Christian Yoder 
 Because of my meeting schedule, it would be particularly helpful if this were videotaped, so I could be sure to be able to attend. 
 I am really interested in the training but will be on vacation on the 7th. Count me in next time.  Thanks for the invite. 
 By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.  The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could do one of several things for you at this point: Stay quiet Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt) Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will not report unless and until we do Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA  I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the "Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

 Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us anyway.  Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person. Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue. 
 Yes. 
 I talked to Brian Whalen today.  He is trying to get an interconnection agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow.  Sierra/Nevada have abandoned their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders.  Brian was very apologetic about taking so long.  He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month.  He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement).  I said I didn't know but that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate people got them.  Lysa- when I get these reports please forward them to Don. 
 Please handle.

  Calif Senate Takes Up Bill On Deal With Small Generators ? 02/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power supplies. The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover those costs from ratepayers. The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 2001, and would run until June 30, 2006. "This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis," Battin said in a press release. Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG), Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B). Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments. The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. reached an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators. Edison wasn't able to comment immediately. Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined. To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin. Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the utilities. Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped operating its market. Both PG&E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May 1, and for January 2001 deliveries by June 1. PG&E paid its November bill on time. Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's 4,400 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying facilities under contract with PG&E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little more than 500 MW of the plants. U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com 
 I hope you caught Lysa's error in transcribing this message.  I said you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has not accepted a rate or that a rate isn't on file.  Sorry about the double negative.  FERC usually speaks in terms of "accepting" rates rather than "setting" rates unless it has had a hearing and found that the rates being charged are unjust and unreasonable.. 
 Robin & Jeff:  Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she gave you yesterday.  Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..." you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate isn't on file".  If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone (503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.  Lysa Akin Ass't to Mary Hain 503/464-7927

 I talked to Christian Yoder today.  He and Steve Hall will be talking tomorrow morning about whether we should file anything at FERC.  I will be on an airplane tomorrow morning so please let me know what we are doing. Thanks. 
 You might also want the attached for the Enron Joinder.  It is the most recently effective FERC Enron rate schedule (along with the FERC filing letter). 
 Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered? 
 FYI 
 What about the questions I asked about whether the new entity would comply with Order No. 2000 (especially if the state has the vertically integrated utilities operate the system)?  See attached word version of my orginal E-mail. 
 Please print this as well.  I'm driving in now.  Thank you again. 
 If Lysa isn't there yet, would you please download these for me? Thank you. 
 Do we want to help Dynegy or do we want to file our usual letter asking for confidential treatment?

 I know we are addressing this on the state side.  I was wondering is there= =20 also a FERC angle we should prepare?  Sue and Joe: don't you think we shoul= d=20 submit an RCR to have Ron do some research on the surrounding issues?  Here= =20 are a few that came to mind. (1) What jurisdiction does FERC have over a state-owned transmission system= =20 (especially in light of Order No. 2000 and the governance of the Cal ISO on= =20 file at FERC)? (2) Is there anything FERC can do to stop the conveyance (e.g., since the= =20 utilities would have to file a Section 203 filing for approval to convey th= e=20 assets, what basis would be available to argue that conveyance was not in t= he=20 public interest.)  Should Joe explore with Hebert the Commission's=20 willingness to fight with the State about this? (3) If the State had the utilities operate the transmission system, subject= =20 to the State's control, would that comply with Order No. 2000? =20 
 Let's promote it in all these groups, just to be on the safe side. 
 This sounds like an issue we should be coordinating with the East desk too. 
 Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.  I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction.  Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?  What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero? 
 Please start drafting the intervention, as you've described and send me an estimate for the RCR. 
 Attached please find two new Notices of Filing in Docket Nos. EL01-33 and EL01-34.  One is a request for a cease and desist order, the other a request for suspension of the underscheduling penalty.  The filings are also attached in a zip file.  Please let me know if you are unable to open the zip file and I will fax (or overnight if you prefer) the documents to you.  - EL01-34.1 - EL01-33.1 - california.zip 
 Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements. Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to address th
